0 The throbbing is due to the slightly increased blood flow to that region of burnt skin. After the burn, your skin receptors become a bit more sensitive in that locality and so you tend to sense that pulsating blood flow easier.   The body sends more blood there to fight infection, begin wound healing, stem any blood loss,  etc 
1 Babies can't really lay on their sides.  They're pretty round and have little control over their limbs, so if you lay them on their side, they pretty quickly roll either to their back or to their front.  So your only options are on their back or on their front.  The evidence is overwhelming that babies are way less likely to die from SIDS if they sleep on their back.  It's not clear why that is (mostly because we won't experiment on babies and watch them die to figure out why, for obvious reasons); the leading theory is that babies on their front can end up with their mouths and noses in a position where they can't breathe and they're not strong enough to clear them.  Overall, being sick while on their back is actually not a big concern.  They have a functioning gag reflex which makes them spit out anything that gets in their throat.  The problem with adults is usually being drunk, which impairs the gag reflex and makes it possible to choke if liquid ends up in their throat.  Unimpaired adults don't normally choke on their own vomit either.
2 Note that the use of the term 'Indian subcontinent' predates the discovery of tectonic plates.  The Indian sub-continent is bounded by mountains and other unfriendly terrain on all of its landward approaches.  This led to a degree of distinctiveness from the surrounding areas. Not only do Indians look different from the Persians/Arabs to the west and the Sinosphere peoples to the east, but they have a very different culture (or spectrum of cultures).  You rarely hear 'subcontinent' used in different contexts because there really isn't anywhere else like India in this respect. All of the various places you mentioned don't contain significant geographically isolated distinct peoples and cultures. 
3 It's been known for some time that cuttlefish have no color receptors in their retinas. However, it's also known that they can match colors with their camouflage abilities, so they must have SOME way of knowing what color things are.    Scientists currently believe that the odd shape of the cuttlefish's pupils lets them distinguish colors by exploiting the fact that [different wavelengths of light bend a little differently in lenses.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration) It's a little bit complicated for an ELI5, but there's the Wikipedia link.    Here are a few articles about the cuttlefish and their unusual eyes:   https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/07/how-colorblind-cuttlefish-may-see-living-color   https://phys.org/news/2016-07-explanation-cephalopods-black-white-vision.html   https://news.berkeley.edu/2016/07/05/weird-pupils-let-octopuses-see-their-colorful-gardens/    
4 It is just part of the sleep system. There are two parts to the sleep system. The sleep-wake homoestasis and the circadian rhythm.   The sleep wake system is pretty simple. The longer you are awake the sleepier you get and the longer you are asleep the less sleepy you get. What happens is sleep-regulating substance(s) build up in the brain the longer you are awake. The more it accumulates the more you want to sleep. When you are asleep the substance rapidly declines.   The circadian rhythm works by using cortisol to help keep you awake during the day and melatonin to help keep you asleep at night. It takes a while for the body to learn when to stay awake and a sleep, that is part of the reason why babies have irregular sleep patterns.  When you are getting closer to sleeping at night the two processes are working together to get you to sleep.
5 They don't. If a helicopter is going down, so are the crew and passengers. The pilot(s) need to do everything in their power to arrest speed prior to impact with the ground. Fortunately, unless the rotors are completely wrecked, there is usually a lot that the pilot can do to minimize the impact.

1 I think it also has to do with the variety of popcorn they use. I remember a Food Network show (Unwrapped I think) that one explained there are two varieties of popcorn “butterfly” and “puffball” the difference being the shape. Butterfly tends to be used for everyday popcorn while puffball popcorn tends to get used for caramel corn and popcorn balls.  I don’t know if this might be what you’re thinking of.
2 Snot (mucus) is a water-based gel-like substance that is composed of salts, antiseptic enzymes (such as lysozymes which can kill bacteria), immunoglobulins (also known as antibodies), and glycoproteins. It essentially functions as a barrier to keep foreign substances from entering your body. Mucus is produced by mucous (notice the spelling difference) membranes in response to an irritant. When your body encounters an allergen, it triggers certain cells called mast cells which releases histamine. Histamine triggers the allergic response, which includes mucus production. All of the components of mucus can be found in blood and are collected by the mucous membranes to produce mucous. Another effect of histamine is that it causes your blood vessels to dilate and become "leaky." When there is leakage into the nasal and sinus cavities, this can also cause congestion.  In order to combat this, you can do a couple things. Antihistamines can block the histamine response and minimize mucous production. There are two generations of antihistamines. The first generation of antihistamines (eg, Benadryl) can be very sedating, while the second generation (eg. Claritin, Zyrtec, Allegra) is much less so. Also, to treat the vasodilation and leakage into the sinus cavities, you can take a mild stimulant (such as pseudoephedrine) to force the blood vessels to constrict and become less leaky. Additionally, nasal sprays containing steroids (such as Flonase) can help suppress your body's response to allergens so that it doesn't release as much histamine.
3 In some states your body doesn't produce much urine eg. sleeping / exercising     People that run marathons often run the whole marathon without having to pee once, your body realises it's a bad time to make urine and doesn't

5 Wind is caused by the difference in air pressure in different places. Warm air is less dense than cold air, so it wants to rise up and cold air wants to fall down. Cold air will push warm air out of the way, typically upwards where the warm air will be pushed away, cool down, and fall down elsewhere to continue the cycle.  Those different air temperatures pushing each other around is wind.  During the day, the Sun is warming the ground, which is warming the air. Air doesn't absorb visible light very well - obviously, that's why you can see through it. At night, the Sun...isn't. So there isn't as much energy warming the air. There is less of a difference between the warm air and the cold air, which is why there is less wind at night *generally speaking*.  Also, if it's been windy all day that means the air has been mixing and moving and shoving other air out of the way *all day*. That particular weather front may have simply pushed the other front out of the way already and there's not much left until the next one moves in.

3 The hormone responsible for the absorption of water is known as vasopressin, or the antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Synthesized in the hypothalamus, its activation signals the kidneys to reabsorb the water passing through it to ensure that we aren’t dehydrated, while its deactivation signals the kidneys to allow water to pass through, ensuring that we aren’t overhydrated.  the simple reason why we don’t feel the urge to urinate when we’re asleep is that the brain, recognizing that the body is at rest, increases the production of ADH. The excess ADH forces the kidneys to reabsorb any water passing through and recirculate it into the bloodstream. As a result, absolutely no urine is produced.

Also, if it's been windy all day that means the air has been mixing and moving and shoving other air out of the way *all day*. That particular weather front may have simply pushed the other front out of the way already and there's not much left until the next one moves in.

7 This sensation is called Jamais vu (the same family as deja vu).  Repetition makes your brain fatigued and if you repeat it enough, your brain is too tired to recognise that a certain word is an actual word.  &gt;Jamais vu is most commonly experienced when a person momentarily does not recognise a word or, less commonly, a person or place, that he or she knows. This can be achieved by anyone by repeatedly writing or saying a specific word out loud.

1 I think it also has to do with the variety of popcorn they use. I remember a Food Network show (Unwrapped I think) that one explained there are two varieties of popcorn “butterfly” and “puffball” the difference being the shape. Butterfly tends to be used for everyday popcorn while puffball popcorn tends to get used for caramel corn and popcorn balls.  I don’t know if this might be what you’re thinking of.
2 Snot (mucus) is a water-based gel-like substance that is composed of salts, antiseptic enzymes (such as lysozymes which can kill bacteria), immunoglobulins (also known as antibodies), and glycoproteins. It essentially functions as a barrier to keep foreign substances from entering your body. Mucus is produced by mucous (notice the spelling difference) membranes in response to an irritant. When your body encounters an allergen, it triggers certain cells called mast cells which releases histamine. Histamine triggers the allergic response, which includes mucus production. All of the components of mucus can be found in blood and are collected by the mucous membranes to produce mucous. Another effect of histamine is that it causes your blood vessels to dilate and become "leaky." When there is leakage into the nasal and sinus cavities, this can also cause congestion.  In order to combat this, you can do a couple things. Antihistamines can block the histamine response and minimize mucous production. There are two generations of antihistamines. The first generation of antihistamines (eg, Benadryl) can be very sedating, while the second generation (eg. Claritin, Zyrtec, Allegra) is much less so. Also, to treat the vasodilation and leakage into the sinus cavities, you can take a mild stimulant (such as pseudoephedrine) to force the blood vessels to constrict and become less leaky. Additionally, nasal sprays containing steroids (such as Flonase) can help suppress your body's response to allergens so that it doesn't release as much histamine.
3 The hormone responsible for the absorption of water is known as vasopressin, or the antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Synthesized in the hypothalamus, its activation signals the kidneys to reabsorb the water passing through it to ensure that we aren’t dehydrated, while its deactivation signals the kidneys to allow water to pass through, ensuring that we aren’t overhydrated.  the simple reason why we don’t feel the urge to urinate when we’re asleep is that the brain, recognizing that the body is at rest, increases the production of ADH. The excess ADH forces the kidneys to reabsorb any water passing through and recirculate it into the bloodstream. As a result, absolutely no urine is produced.

It is not within our role as moderators to determine whether a comment is correct or not. We don't pretend to be subject matter experts in all fields, and as such leave the correction process to the comments (as below). I know that is frustrating to a lot of people, and we are sorry we can't help more in that regard, it is just very much not a precedent that would be healthy to set.  I know a locked post always sucks, but this argument is devolving and is starting to get uncivil.  Petwins
5 Wind is caused by the difference in air pressure in different places. Warm air is less dense than cold air, so it wants to rise up and cold air wants to fall down. Cold air will push warm air out of the way, typically upwards where the warm air will be pushed away, cool down, and fall down elsewhere to continue the cycle.  Those different air temperatures pushing each other around is wind.  During the day, the Sun is warming the ground, which is warming the air.

10 It's so they're guaranteed to die in prison essentially. With multiple life sentences you're almost certain to not get out on good behavior, or if your conviction is overturned I believe. Get rid of one life sentence? Cool, you still have another to go. Or maybe more like you stated they do.
11 They did. Syphillis being one. It just didn’t have the same impact in Europe as a weakened kind of that disease already existed. The new strain brought back from the New World did a fair amount of damage though. The New World domesticated plants which don’t carry diseases that can be transferred to people. The old world domesticated animals which were a disease reservoir for a whole host of sicknesses. Europeans were used to disease in a way the Native Americans were not so anything brought back from the New World wasn’t as deadly
12 Swallowing is an automatic function, like breathing. You don’t realize how often you swallow until it hurts. I don’t know if we do swallow more when we have a sore throat, but my guess would be that it’s simply more noticeable because you don’t want to.
13 Some chemicals can burn you even if they’re not hot. If you drink one of these chemicals it will burn on the way down. If you puke it back up it will burn on the way out too, hurting you more.
14 The length of the digit determines nail growth. Fingers are longer so they grow faster on fingers.
15 In a nutshell, crying is a response from the feeling part of your mind, and talking is from the rational part.  When you are about to cry the feeling part takes over more strongly and pushes the rational to the side for a bit
16 Most people here probably just get it done as part of the routine servicing and don't have to think of it separately. Do American cars get regular services by garages or dealers?
17 Moving air helps and intensifies  evaporating moisture from your body, like sweat, general skin moisture, etc. Evaporating is energy (and temperature) consuming process, as energy is required to move water molecules from liquid to gaseous phase.
18 In the bible Hell is called the lake of fire.  There are other torments described in Hell but it is mainly fire that never goes out.  Gehenna from the Greek refers to the "Valley of Hinnom", which was a garbage dump just outside of Jerusalem. It was a place where people burned their garbage and there was always a fire burning there.
19 It goes back to trading stamps, companies like S&amp;H sold trading stamps to various businesses like grocers. You got stamps based on your purchase cost. Once you amassed enough stamps, you could trade them in for things like a free toaster or pots and pans.   A law was passed that the stamps had to have a cash value, i was normally 1/10 of a penny.   In the 60s, stamps were fading and coupons were becoming more popular. As some states treated coupons the same as stamps, they needed a cash value. It was set at 1/20th of a cent.   Theoretically, you can present 20 coupons for the penny at the retailer.
20 I believe it’s a safety thing - to make it easier to get out in a crash and they do crash a fair bit. It certainly would be more aero to have an enclosed cockpit.
21 It's likely related to the well-known "sugar tax" being levied by various governments, US included. Drinks with sugar levels above a certain limit are subject to additional taxation.  Removal of X% sugar, and replacement with sucralose, will take it below that level.
22 As /u/EgNotaEkkiReddit wrote, an array is simply a block of data. Usually fixed size (can't resize it without creating a new array and copying the items to it), with N elements stored sequentially in memory, numbered from 0 to N-1.  A list is any sequential collection of items. You can add items to a list, remove items, sometimes even move items around. Unlike an array, a list can have different implementations:  * The actual data can be stored in an array, so it's easy to access any item in the middle of the list (you can ask for item #4 in the list for exapmle), but hard to add and remove items unless it's from the end of the list. This for example is known as `ArrayList` in Java or `List` in C#.  * The list can be a linked list - each item in the list holds a reference to the next item on the list (as in /u/EgNotaEkkiReddit's example). This makes it easy to add or remove items from the middle of the list, but difficult to access items (in order to get to item #4, you start from #0, from there to #1, to #2, etc.)
23 But wait. How has no one simply said, "hormones?" Hormones told my boobs to stop growing. I'm guessing they tell a dude's penis when it's done as well. Granted, there is a *huge* age range wherein this can happen, but it is the simplest biological answer.   If you're still a teenager, I'll tell you this. 15:1, college penises were bigger than high school penises in my experience. If you're 18 or younger, you may not be done yet. (I can also tell you it *actually* doesn't matter anyhow, but considering I may be taking to a minor, Imma stop right there.)  But yeah- hormones, and various growth-related parts of your brain. That's the simple answer.
24 I do not know the cause in your specific situation HOWEVER, the feeling of grogginess when you wake up is due to interrupting REM sleep (or "deep sleep", if you will). There are apps that claim to monitor your sleep movements and try to wake you up when you're not in REM sleep, thus keeping you from feeling groggy and tired when woken up.
25 The part that they are operating on during an ice pick (prefrontal) lobotomy is relatively free of major blood vessels.
26 The wire has electrical resistance to the flow of electricity. It's kind of like friction and the longer a wire is,  the more resistance the electric current will see. This will make the wire hotter and the electrical force on the other end lower
27 It... doesn’t. It flatly does not. You’ll keep metabolizing at whatever rate is necessary to keep you alive, based on how much energy your body’s using up. If you eat more than that, you’ll store most of the excess in fat. Some will be lost as heat.  It might help you stay sane, though.
28 Because if you think there is a chance you can finish the race despite needing to stop you will push yourself beyond breaking point. Sometime that works, and sometime it doesn't

30 They do realize their big size, and so do their predators.  The predators try to tip the odds in their own favor by going after the young, already sick, or injured, that's usually the hunts you see on TV.
31 The outside is actually moving faster. You can prove this by taking one point one centimeter from the center, and one point one meter from the center. The distance the outer point has to travel is way more than the inner point and because they arrive at the endpoint at the same time, the outside must be moving faster.
32 On the ISS, water (H2O) is changed into Oxygen (O2) and Hydrogen (H2)  by use of electricity (Electrolysis)
33 
34 Because the ground can only *push back* as much as you can push it. Insects can only gain a small amount of kinetic energy while falling, which means the ground can only push back as much as it pushes. Humans, while falling, can gather quite a lot of kinetic energy, and when you hit the ground, the ground pushes back with that much energy.  Humans also have a lot more bits and pieces you could hit as you hit the ground that could spell bad news.
35 Because as you speak, your vocal chords vibrate. These chords are connected to your body, so the vibrations not only are carried by the air to your ears, but through your body to your cochlea as well. This is why you sound different if you plug your ears and speak.
36 Before widespread use of USB-C you could argue that it being reversible was a big plus over USB-Micro-B.
37 Not sure I understand your question but stars are born in nebulas from the formation of hydrogen.   So you have a massive cloud of hydrogen which swirls around. This means that certain regions will have more hydrogen than others. These areas then start pulling more hydrogen to them due to their increase in mass -&gt; more gravity.  At some point the density of the area is so great that it generates so much heat that it ignites -&gt; a star is born.  Over time more and more stars are born and eventually the nebula will disapear since all hydrogen is now in stars. At this point it is only a matter of time (a very very long time) until the stars run out of hydrogen and die.
38 Second question; having a transplant done by taking from an older person to a younger person.... doesn’t that mean the organ will have to work for likely over 100 years? Does this have any negative effects?
39 Do you mean a crankshaft?
40 It's more that your fingers are soft and squishy. Also, ticks are very small, so the force you're applying is most likely spread over their entire body. If you just try to step on one, they can fit between the treads of your shoe.
41 What other answers are forgetting is the *convection cap* that forms a layer of hot, dry air in between the warm, wet air and cool, dry air that "clash" to form storms.  Cold air is more dense than hot air. When a cold front meets a warm front, the cold air usually shoves the hot air out of the way, usually upwards on top of the cold air. Hot air rises, after all. If the warm air is full of moisture, that moisture condenses into clouds and rain.  A convection cap is a layer of hot, dry air that rises above the warm air because dry air is less dense than humid air, and it might also be warmer. This cap prevents the warm, humid air from rising.  When the cold front meets this combination of low-elevation warm, wet air and hot dry convection cap, it can't shove the warm air up so it flows up instead, on top of the other two. The cold air wants to go down and the humid air wants to go up, and the cold air continues to get cold in the upper atmosphere while the humid air get more warm hugging the hot ground, and the convection cap just stays in the way and prevents the two from mixing.  Eventually a "hole" in the convection cap forms where the warm air can flow through. As it does, it makes room for the cold air to flow around the whole system and inwards towards that hole. That puts pressure on the warm air, forcing it flow through the hole faster, which allows more cold air to fall around the system, which pushes on the warm air more.  As the warm air flows through the hole, angular momentum is conserved, so it swirls, not unlike water down a drain, except up instead of down. That is your tornado.  The United States has a big, warm body of water (the Gulf of Mexico) which is right next to some really hot, dry deserts (Texas and Arizona and Nevada), which are right next to some cold, dry Rocky mountains (and also Canada). They all kind of meet in Kansas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, etc. Those conditions exist elsewhere in the world, but they're all *really big* in the US and otherwise uninterrupted by anything else. There's nothing but big, flat, empty plains. There's no mountains or big bodies of water to disrupt those big weather fronts.
42 Typically app writers make a deal with an advertising service. When you do certain things, they send a description of what you did to that service, so the app can show you relevant ads. However, that service in turn may also be working with additional apps, so the ads show up on multiple apps.
43 The RFID field is significantly more powerful than any field generated by a phone. Also phone compass's don't have particularly strong magnetic fields in the first place, IIRC they work based on the [Hall Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect) which is better as it doesn't involve moving a physical dial.
44 Billions of years ago a star (probably multiple) much larger than our sun went super nova and seeded our corner of the galaxy with the elements it was once forging at its core, along with new elements that were created in the explosion. The cloud of gas and dust left over from the explosion collapsed into a disk and parts of that disc began to clump together forming our solar system. Hydrogen and oxygen atoms that were in that disc bonded with each other and became water.
45 Chapped skin has micro cracks on it. Think of them as very small little cuts. So, you are putting lotion on those little cuts and it can sting.
46 Our eye muscles are designed to work in tandem, and we are constantly strengthening that uniformity through usage (just think of how often you move your eyes together). Just as it’s sometimes difficult to move other body parts in an unusual way (like rolling your tongue or making your fingers do a Vulcan salute), your eyes just aren’t used to working independently and need a little extra effort to cross or uncross.   I’ve had a corneal condition in one eye for most of my life that has strengthened the other eye to compensate. I can move that eye independently of the other because (so say my eye surgeons) I have unintentionally trained the muscles to work that way.
47 Our brains need a *lot* of blood to stay alive. Normally, our bodies work just fine pumping blood against gravity and up to our noggins, but sometimes things go wrong. If for any reason there's a drop in blood pressure or heart rate or reduced level of oxygen to your brain, your brain is going to make you faint. Why? Because it will make you horizontal very quickly, and that will help restore blood flow to your brain since your body is no longer working against gravity. So fainting (technically called syncope) is about preserving bloodflow to the brain, which will prevent brain damage, but that's the extent that it has to do with damage. Preserving your brain is the paramount consideration. If your brain thinks it's not getting enough oxygen, it doesn't care about any other part of your body in that moment.  &amp;#x200B;  Anything that causes a sudden drop in blood pressure or heart rate can trigger fainting. Some of these things are physical, and some are psychological. I'm not entirely sure how to answer the rest of your question because you brought up this idea of "losing control"and control but I don't know that means or how it relates to this. If you clarify, I can answer the rest.
48 &gt;What is the one thing that causes things to clip through one another in video games.  There is no one things. There is literally thousands of different bugs that allow for no-clip glitches. Sometimes its just as simple certain walls not having collision. Adding hitboxes to objects takes time, and if you assume a player will never interact with an object there is no real reason to add one. Things like the ceiling of levels often times dont have hotboxes, if the game lacks the vertical mobility to get there.   Other times it may require an animation that forces your character into a certain direction and orientation. Doom for example always puts your character a set distance from your opponent at the end of a glory kill. This means that if you hug really close to an enemy with your back to the wall the animation will put you through the wall at the end of it. Essentially teleporting you through the wall.   Other times it may simply be a matter of going so fast that you your individual movement never actually touch the wall. If you think of your character as simply teleporting as a set number of pixels , and if you are moving fast enough you can move teleport through walls.   There are also glitches that involve you despawning your own hitbox. For example, in the ratchet &amp; clank game if you start a level on the same frame that you fall out of the map, the game wont know where to put your hitbox. This allows you to essentially no clip through any wall.  There are also glitches that involve trigger skipping. Games dont load the entire map at the same time and sometimes things with physics, like doors, wont spawn until you get to a certain part of the map. If you can find away to avoid that trigger the door will be there, but its physics wont load and you can just walk right through.  These are just the ones i can think of off the top of my head. Depending on how the game is coded there can be thousands of possible ways to make it so your character can move through objects.
49 The horn does not "amplify" the sound, but it couples the available energy to the free air more efficiently. Kind of like how the correct bicycle gear lets you pedal at a speed and torque where you transmit the most power to the bike wheels.
50 SOS boxes on sides of roads. Assistance by others. More trucks on the roads.  More parts you could physically fix in the car.  The thing also is times change, tech changes, attitudes change.  Back then it was acceptable, now people will assume you have a cell phone and keep on going past.
51 It depends on the initial conditions. If they are not touching the ship when it starts spinning they should experience weightlessness. If they are spun with the ship they have the same forces acting upon them and it will appear that gravity is acting on them.
52 You cannot. But you can wash off dust that contains radioactive material, which will continue to bombard you and other bystanders with radiation until you get rid of it.
53 [Here is a video](https://youtu.be/VptMkX2K7VE)  basically it's a titration type test that let's you known parts per million
54 Insects etc do not have ears in the sense that we have. They have organs scattered about them. It's safe to say that those organs' sensitivity has evolved to react appropriately.
55 Anxiety is a feeling strongly related to your "fight or flight" system and heavily involves norepinephrine.   This is the neurotransmitter that you release when you are fearful or uncomfortable that raises your heart rate, changes the flow of your blood to your muscles to prepare to run, and away from your gut because your body is more concerned about rubning than eating; this is what causes you to feel nauseous when you are anxious.   Norepinephrine puts your body in a state of alert, preparing for danger. This is why you feel more on edge and more focused on certain things while you're anxious; your body is looking for a threat and preparing to either fight or run away.  Anxiety is an abnormal reaction to stimuli that wouldn't normally cause this or an increased reaction more intense than normal. So while nost people might be a little anxious around crowds, a normal reaction, someone with anxiety can be much more anxious, due to an abnormally large amount of norepinephrine.
56 Hunger is the feeling of an empty stomach, it has nothingvto do with nutrients or digestion. You could put anything in there, a rock, a sponge, a balloon.  Just not liquids, they go straight throigh the stomach to the gut, that doesn't help.  That's how you can drink 2000 calories of alcohol and stll be super hungry.
57 Public key cryptography doesn't require certificates, certificates are only there to ensure that Alice is actually talking to Bob  Without certificates Alice asks Bob for his public key to send him a message, but Bob's evil twin Rob intercepts the message and gives Alice his key instead. He still passes all her messages on to Bob so she won't notice but he makes a copy of each message before passing them along  Certificates let Bob prove he's Bob. When Alice asks for his certificate with his public key she'll see his friend Sven vouching for him, when she checks out Sven's certificate she'll see Dave vouching for him. She knows Dave, everyone knows Dave! If Dave says Sven is trustworthy and Sven says Bob is the Bob she wanted to talk to then Alice knows her messages are only going to the person she wanted to talk to. This makes it a lot harder for Rob to get in the middle as he'd have to fake a certificate rather than just intercept the initial messages
58 In the case of the cream cheese frosting, its the sugar which prohibits bacterial growth to a large extent - same reason why maple syrup and honey are perfectly safe to keep out of the fridge (and you should, you heathens) - there's so much sugar in it, bacteria don't have a chance.
59 Typical high end sports car are much wider than regular car due to increased performance and the scissor door in high end sports car allow their owner to exit the vehicle easily even parked in between cars. By having the door opening up instead of traditionally outward, the owner would gain a lot more opening to get out of the car vs having to squeeze between the car and the door to not dent the other car.
60 Flux, in physics, is the amount of a field passing perpendicularly through a surface.   If you have a room filled with a constant field of 10 X Units pointed straight up, and have a flat horizontal square hovering in the middle of the room with an area of 4 Y units, the flux is 40 XY. (Where XY is just the new measurement unit. For magnetic flux, that's the Weber.)  Obviously, flux can become a lot more difficult to calculate with a complicated field that isn't constant and points in weird directions, or with a complicated surface that has a weird shape, or a field and surface that don't meet perpendicularly. For example, if the field is not pointed straight up but instead pointed sideways with a 30 degree angle to the ground, the flux is now only 20 XY, since the amount of field passing *perpendicularly* through the square is only the vertical component of the field, or sin(30)*40=20.   Magnetic flux is 'caused' simply by the existence of a magnetic field and a surface (which can be totally made-up) it can go through.
61 A hypercube, aka a tesseract.    You can't directly draw one. But you can draw the 'net' of one - the same way you can draw the net of a cube.  If you could somehow [fold this together](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Tesseract_net_Crooked_House.svg/520px-Tesseract_net_Crooked_House.svg.png) you'd get a 4D object, the same way that if you [fold this together](https://www.nctm.org/uploadedImages/Content/Activities/3-5/CubeFoldStatic.gif) you get a cube.
62 Different ice makers!  Those small rough cube-ish pieces of ice you commonly see in fountain drinks is called "nugget" ice and is made by ice machines specifically designed to make that style of ice. This type of ice is commonly found in commercial ice makers, but not really as much in the home market, where a similar thing is achieved using "crushed" ice. But you can buy specialty ice makers to make this!  Nugget ice has a lot of surface area and fill up a glass easily due to its small size. This means it can quickly make a beverage quite cold with its rough shape and small size being in contact with a lot of liquid.  Your home ice makers at home generally pour ice into very smooth molds to freeze, as such, they come out quite smooth compared to nugget ice
63 Your fingers are far more sensitive than your toes, mostly because we use our fingers to interact with the world while our toes are just used to help us run faster.
64 It’s a wave and a stream of particles - known as wave-particle duality.  It doesn’t “pulse” per se.  The “problem” with light is that it can behave like a stream of particles in some experiments, and a wave in others.  Edit: typo
65 Be aware that the German V-2 rockets of WW2 flew several times faster than the speed of sound; they were close to being hypersonic. A large part of the problem of going supersonic is simply the power required and rockets are much more powerful than jet engines. Part of the reason for the early Soviet lead in space was their concentration on rockets whereas the US put more effort into aircraft.  Even aircraft powered by rockets are at a disadvantage over purely ballistic rockets because so much less weight is available for fuel and engines.
66 Let's say your body is a huge factory that does things (in this case - lifting a battery). Your consciousness is the boss that decides what the factory actually does and how. Your muscles are regular workers, who actually do stuff according to boss's orders. They would not know what to do without him. But suddenly the conveyor belt starts heating up and risks to catch on fire. When workers see it, they won't go to the boss and ask for permission to stop working and fix the problem. First of all, they will stop the production (this is what happened with you) so nothing gets seriously damaged. Once everything is back to normal, a good boss would look into the situation, figure out what happened and try to prevent such situations.  &amp;#x200B;  P.S. It's ELI5 after all :D
67 As u/Concise_Pirate says, it's not the height that cause things to heat up on re-entry, it's the speed.  The thing is, it's not the friction from the air that causes the heat, it's the *compression* of the air in front of the thing hitting the atmosphere. Because it's coming in at (much) more than the speed of sound, the air can't get out of the way fast enough. So it gets squeezed together, and compressing a gas makes it hotter (see Boyle's law). It's the heat from that compression that burns objects up on reentry.  Baumgartner started out in the atmosphere (albeit really, really thin atmosphere), and started from a standstill (relative to the atmosphere). As a result, he never broke the speed of sound (because the wind resistance prevented him), so the air was always able to get out of his way fast enough to not compress very much. So he didn't heat up very much.
68 Intelligence is a sort of vague thing, with many different interpretations. Generally, however, we try to compare them to what a human is capable of.   A human child develops as they grow older. For instance, human infants don't learn that a mirror is showing them themselves until around 18 months of age (about 1 and a half years old). Until then, they don't understand what a mirror is and may think it is another baby. This is because parts of their brain responsible for this type of logic and reason aren't developed enough yet.   We can sort of translate this to animals. Can an animal pass the mirror test? If so, they have some developmental features of a human of that approximate age. They have enough brain function and specialization to realise the mirror is not showing another animal, but themselves.   There are many tests like this that test how developed certain parts of the brain are.   We can also test things like abstract reasoning, such as by figuring out what should come next in a pattern.   Theres many kinds of intelligence though and an animal may have some skills and not others. They may pass the mirror test, but fail other tests that a younger human infant would pass.  But it helps to give us an idea of what an animal is capable of.
69 &gt; Is the broker using my money to invest then I'm just getting a cut of what they make?  Close, its:  The broker uses your money to invest, then they are just getting a cut of what they make, you keep the rest.  &gt; Why can't I just do this myself?  You can, but managing your money to the extent they do is a full time job. Its a lot easier for you to just leave it to them. Anyone can invest, but not many can invest well.  &gt; What if they take a bigger cut?  Then you can go find a broker that will take a smaller cut  &gt; Why did the government set up these things in the first place?  They want people to save for retirement, so the government can spend less on benefits when they get old. They encourage people to do this by offering tax exempt things like this.
70 It radiates off into deep space eventually.  The average temperature of the universe is -270C and it's unfathomably huge, your little radiator is hopelessly tiny in comparison.  Even stars and galaxies are ultimately tiny in comparison, eventually it will all freeze in the somewhat counter-intuitively named "heat death" where all energy is finally evenly distributed.
71 We don't really know yet. The brain is an incredibly complicated thing. However, we do know that different regions of the brain trigger when different things are being thought/happening. For example, we have a region of the brain responsible for transmitting images from the eyes. We have another region responsible for recognising shapes and objects. We have yet another region responsible for coordinating our own actions in response to those objects. When such a region is damaged, such as when it's cut out completely, one of two things can happen. Sometimes the brain can compensate and process the information elsewhere. Sometimes, there's nothing it can do, and it just loses that functionality all together.   There are a lot of really interesting conditions resulting from damage to visual areas of the brain. A condition called visual agnosia for example, which occurs in two forms. People can explain to you what an apple is, then when you show them an apple, they won't be able to tell you what they're look at. They know what an apple is, they know what shape an apple is, but when they look at the apple, they don't see an apple. Their eyes are describing the shape of the apple, but the bit of their brain that converts the signals into an imagined image doesn't build an apple in their mind. The second form they can look at an apple and describe the exact shape of it, but not tell you "this is an apple".   There can also be damage to the part of the brain that links the shape of objects to the type of movements needed to pick it up. Someone could for example know precisely what a mug is, see a mug, and then go to pick it up using the same hand shape they'd use for a pencil.   There's also a condition where you can have perfect, unhindered vision, but your brain just forgets the entire right half of your visual field. You can show someone with such a condition a picture and ask them to replicate the picture on a new sheet of paper. When they're looking at it, they can describe the entire picture, but the exact moment they stop looking at it, they forget that half the image existed, so when they try to replicate a drawing of a cat, they only draw half a cat and say "this is complete". Until you point it out to them that half the cat is missing, they just don't notice.
72 Full stomach and upper intestine pushing down on a load of more squishy intestines, probably. The weight has to be supported somehow.
73 Gas liquid Absorption   It is similar to how a sponge absorbes water. There is space between molecules of water. Due to this the density of the solution increases.
74 Our body doesn't just need water.  It needs a balance of water to salts (this is why drinking sea water is bad.  It's way too salty, so our body, in an effort to get rid of the salts will use water to flush it out).  Our kidneys regulate this.  If you have too much water and not enough salt, you pee a lot (and it's mostly water).  &amp;#x200B;  Pedialyte is balanced with water and salts already.  So it goes into our bodies with the ratio we want.  If we are already over-salted, then it's not really what we need, we'd just need water.
75 *social* animals like petting, since they use grooming and other contact to reinforce social bonds.  Most mammals and birds are at least semi-social and will react positively to contact from an individual they know.  Non-social animals are typically less receptive, although some can be trained to tolerate it.  Do not pet cobras.
76 THC is fat-soluble. Meaning when you smoke weed THC is stored in the fat cells, meth and many other drugs are water-soluble. You could drink enough water to flush meth out of your system for good. With THC, water only dilutes it for a short amount of time and cannot flush your system because it is stored in the fat.
77 
78 They are connected to a power source, either through the cord or from an internal battery.  Ultimately they work the same as larger speakers, but since they're one centimeter from your ear and only need to be heard by you they can get by with very low power.
79 'Plasma' air cleaners are a form of electrostatic precipitation. they use giant ones in a lot of manufacturing processes.     The idea is that a lot of particulate matter that comes from fire (and other hot sources) is often charged (has a + or a minus), so if you run it past a plate that has an electrical current running through it, it will stick to that plate. You may notice at home that your computer/tv/lights tends to get dustier than other non electric things, thats why.     So basically they are good at getting dust out of the air. The problem with using them in indoor air is that rooms are rarely well mixed. You would need to attach them directly to a ventilation system, not just around the place. It won't get all the air but might help if for example there is an air connection between the main house and the garage.     It would be better to rinse your gear with water (maybe add a little baking soda to the water if you want to be safe). I would look into HEPA filters as an alternate (do a price check), and maybe a cheap PM sensor (Plantower works pretty well). It is unlikely to help with sickness.
80 Sugar and salt are useful and necessary for the body to function. Sour foods have acid, and bitter foods are alkaline, and both of these can be harmful in large doses (which is relative). You'd need to consume a lot less sour or bitter food to throw your body out of whack than you would by eating too much sugar or salt.
81 Seeds can lie dormant for a long time when properly dehydrated. I don’t know about years on end. A little rehydration and heat will get them going again and germinating.
82 Your face is full of pores, which are little holes in the skin that work in many forms.  These holes can be clogged with materials such as dirt and sometimes your body thinks of it as an infection and activates it defense mechanism to stop it.  It seals the pore and sends in the fleet which causes inflammation and the development of puss.  Think of a golf ball with all the little dimples on it.  If one of the dimples gets dirt stuck it in, the body send white blood cells which makes the area around it grow and turn reddish.  Sometimes they blister up and turn white because they fill with puss and that make it look like a white pimple.  Your body doesn't say, "Hey, put one on the right cheek, even with the nose". Instead is says, "Jimmy forgot to wash his face all the way and now the pore located at (location) is clogged.  Send in the reinforcements and lets fix this".
83 Pigments are subtractive, they work by absorbing light. So if you mix a red and green pigment, you're not creating more red and green light, you're absorbing some non-red light and some non-green light, so they "cancel eachother out". Compare that to adding light together, which (not counting edge cases of destructive interference) just gives more of each kind of light, which will obviously look different then less light.
84 Probably because they all are made by different companies who have different ways of doing things. Also Apple products allow you to easily transfer files between bunch of devices, because they are made by one company, so there is only one standard.
85 Marijuana us a pretty complex drug and affects many different receptors in the brain, where as other drugs tend to affect just a few.   It affects a large number of things, including mood, memory, perception, and less obvious things like your immune system. It even interacts with the opiod systen in your brain, a naturally occuring system of receptors and neurotransmitters that help control pain.   It affects dopamine, endorphins, and norepinephrine, which can cause euphoria and/or anxiety. Anxiety comes in the way it affects norepinephrine, which makes you feel on edge and raises things like your heart rate.   The reason marijuana seems so different from other drugs is because other drugs tend to either give a boost of energy and mood, decrease energy and make you feel more relaxed, or cause hullucenations, but marijuana causes a mixture of all of these feelings due to its more complex actions on a wider array of receptors in your brain. It can make you feel nore energetic, ancious, or less energetic and relaxed and it can affect how you think and perceive things (psychotropic effects).
86 You have active radio transponder on the buses or some other way to detect them and change the switching of the light so it let them trough first.    So the the idea is if a buss is detected on road A then next road that will have a green light will be A and leave it green until the buss has passed trough the intersection. The cycle the normal way trough the roads in the intersection
