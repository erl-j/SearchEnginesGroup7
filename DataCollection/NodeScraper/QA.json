{"title":"ELI5: Why does a taste still linger in my mouth even after I drink water or other beverages?","answer":"In addition to fats and oils, some foods chemically alter the taste buds they come in contact with.  For example, orange juice or mint (or god forbid, orange juice AND mint) both affect your taste buds by inhibiting parts of the receptors, and enhancing other parts.  \n\nHave you ever skewed an image in photoshop or maybe mspaint?  Foods like orange juice and mint will skew taste buds' perception similarly, so that for a while you'll only be able to taste things through these temporarily modified taste buds.  Things taste differently than they normally would, although they don't necessarily taste like the food that modified your taste buds.  (e.g. drinking orange juice and then having a soda doesn't make the soda taste like oranges, but it won't taste like soda normally would)  \n\nLikewise, some foods act more like photo filters (think instagram).  If you eat food with a lot of garlic, chances are that you will be tasting garlic on the rest of your food for a while, even if that other food doesn't have garlic.  If you apply a sepia filter, everything you put in the filter comes out sepia.  \n\nSome tastes can be neutralized by counterbalancing a ph or removed with chewing gum/brushing teeth.  Although it would taste pretty gross, you can drink milk after drinking orange juice to effectively balance out the acidity with the base content of the milk and greatly lessen the time that it would take for your taste buds to taste things normally again.  You could brush your teeth to remove stong tastes like garlic, fats, and oils, although then you'd have minty mouth!  "},

{"title":"Is there an actual reason slow pages always seem to load as soon as I hit F5, or is it just confirmation bias?","answer":"- Most pages nowadays are served from some kind of database-backed application server. It's not uncommon for them to bug out, overload or hit some other obstacle making it stuck - forever or until some timeout cuts it from waiting. Hitting refresh will likely get you served from a fresh process that doesn't have such problems and is able to answer right away.\n\n- Bigger sites are often behind some load balancer. These distribute your requests between multiple similar servers in order to handle more users. If you got directed to an overloaded or dying server, hitting refresh may allow the load balancer to reroute you to a better working server.\n\n- What /u/rederic said"},

{"title":"ELI5: How exactly do mushroom clouds form after a nuclear/thermonuclear explosion? Are the clouds formed different from conventional bomb clouds?","answer":"An exploding nuclear bomb creates more or less a perfect sphere of fire. This sphere is very hot and less dense than the surrounding air. This causes it to rise. As it rises, [Rayleigh-Taylor instability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh-Taylor_instability) kicks in (as it does whenever a less dense substance moves through a denser one), causing the fireball to turn into a torus, sucking up dust into the \"stem,\" creating the traditional mushroom appearance. (If the bomb is detonated very high above the ground, there is no stem.)\n\nThere is nothing particularly unique about nuclear weapons creating mushroom clouds. The only trick is that they are much, much larger explosions than pretty much anything else, so the clouds they produce are much, much larger. The cloud from the Nagasaki bomb rose to around 20,000 feet. The cloud from the first H-bomb rose to around 100,000 feet. Which are orders of magnitude more than most other mushroom clouds you'll find — except maybe those created by [a volcano](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MtRedoubtedit1.jpg). "},

{"title":"ELI5 whether or not humans have stopped evolving biologically and why?","answer":"It's certainly true that genes \"won't evolve like they used to\". But then again, that's true for *every* major environmental change that has ever happened in the world, ever.\n\nGenes have stopped evolving like the did during the Cambrian Explosion (when speciation went rife). Genes have stopped evolving like they did after the dinosaur extinction. Genes have stopped evolving the way they did after the Ice Age.\n\nGenes will *always* stop evolving in ways that are no longer necessary. But they will start to evolve in *new* and *different* ways.\n\nE.g.: now that we don't have to worry about scavenging for food (at least in first world countries), maybe we'll start to evolve genes that enable us to lose weight more quickly, etc.\n\nAs I say, evolution never stops. It just changes direction to suit the *current* situation :-)"},

For the most part, state governments operate in a similar fashion to the US government with relatively minor differences depending on the state.  Each Governor is the head of their state.  Under the Supremacy Clause the law of the Federal Government is the law of the land.  However, states are allowed to nullify federal law if it is proven to be unconstitutional. The republics you mention don't exist.  "},

Stress takes many forms, but has a relatively cumulative effect. Stress from running ten miles is different than stress from not eating, but they both push you toward your threshold. Cold is a stressor. When you are cold you are sitting closer to your threshold so it takes less to push you across the threshold into 'pain.'"},

{"title":"ELI5: Why do American TV series have strange breaks in airing?","question_detail":"So I was wondering why do American TV series have those strange breaks in airing. For instance, season 5 of The Good Wife started September 29th and aired weekly till December 1st. Then there was this first break in airing (which would be understandable if it was Christmas but hello, Christmas starts on December 24th, not December 1st) and the show again aired on January 5th only to have another break since January 12th and the last four episodes are to be air in... March. \n\nOther shows (The Mentalist, Revolution) have similar or even stranger breaks. Why is that? I understand some one-night events (like sports finals or something) that could break into airing schedule but if this break lasts for three months then what's the point of calling it one season? ","answer":"This is all pretty spot on--the other part is that during the month of Christmas, lots of television channels end up dedicating their evenings to running Christmas specials, etc.\n\nI suppose this could be argued as a question of if they're showing all the specials so they can take the time off filming (ie, cheaper), or if they're taking the time off so they can show the specials."},
{"title":"ELI5: Why do (some) people find farts funny?","question_detail":"And have humans always been entertained by farts?","answer":"They're seen as taboo.

{"title":"ELI5: Why the \"qwerty\" keyboard configuration was chosen to be the way it is.","question_detail":"Why not alphabetical?

Also, if you want to sell a program able to create and use compressed files, you can use the zip format for free...you have to license rar.\n\nSo the issues isn't whether or not you can use rar files for free...it is a matter of being locked into a single way to use them."},

{"title":"ELI5: How come when your torso comes into contact with cold water you suddenly gasp for air?","question_detail":"Have you ever jumped into a cold pool or stepped into a cold shower?

This works well at getting your hand or your foot out of danger, but when your body tries to do it with your chest, you force all the air out of your lungs.\n\nTo make the reflex work for you better, always touch hot/potentially painful things with the backs of your hands.

Descartes, Hume and Locke however described a person as a creature that has an ongoing conciousness of time, which would enable that creature to reflect on the past and make plans for the future. Boethius describes a person as a creature that is capable of thinking rationally and making rational decisions. Peter Singer says what makes us a person is the fact that we are AWARE of the fact that we are a person, he calls that self-awareness. Those descriptions of a person can well go hand in hand and function as a rough description of what makes us a person. There's just one problem: what if a mentally disabled human being is not concious of time, aware of itself neither can he/she think rationally. Is that human being not a person? Is he/she an IT? Its a difficult questions, but I really can't go too deep into this :P You really should read Singer though, he's one of my favourites"},

What would be the point of a publisher not applying this to their ebook?(I'm asking because I noticed it won't be applied to the Kindle version of Brandon Sanderson's \"Words of Radiance.\")","answer":"It may look like big dollar signs, but it's not. The fact is that DRM is basically ineffective at stopping anyone who wants to pirate a book. What it *is* effective at is keeping people from exercising legitimate rights. Customers said they weren't going to spend money on things if their rights were trampled, and authors and publishers are starting to listen."},
{"title":"why does compression help a sprain?","question_detail":"I mildly sprained my ankle the other day and made it worse yesterday by walking on it a lot.

{"title":"ELI5: How does the heating/AC system in a Tesla car work?","question_detail":"In a conventional car, it is my understanding that the heater has to do with engine coolant, and the AC compressor is driven by the engine itself. So how do they work in a totally electric car? Does running the heater or AC in an electric car have a significant effect on the range I could drive before having to recharge?","answer":"The ac works similar to how the ac works in a house, the compressor is driven by an electric motor instead of the gas engine.  This only takes a couple horsepower, (just like in a gas car) so your range will drop about as much as your mpg in a gas car will with the ac on.\n\nThe heater is way different.  In a gas car the heater uses waste heat from the engine which is basically free.  In an electric car, the heater operates much like a very powerful hair dryer.  This has some advantages (it's warm right when you turn it on, there is no waiting 10 minutes for the engine to warm up) but it uses a lot of electricity (on the order of 10 horsepower at full blast).  This will have a much larger effect on range then the ac, somewhere around 10% - 20%"},

Mcdonalds pays 1 million to the channel to run that commercial, because that 1 million dollars will hit 30-60 million viewers and even if only 300,000 people bought 1 single item out of 60 million..... that means the commercial was only .005% effective... lets say worth 5 bucks....they just made 1.5 million dollars that day or month.. Basically they handed someone 1 million dollars for a month, in return they got 1.5 million 30 days later.... "},
{"title":"ELI: Why is the plural Mothers-In-Law and not Mother-in-Laws, or Attorneys general and not attorney generals.","answer":"\"Attorney\" is a noun; \"general\" is an adjective modifying it.  Most of the time in English, the adjective comes before the noun, but in some relatively rare cases like these, the opposite is true.  This sort of adjective is known as a \"post-positive adjective\".  When it comes to pluralization (in English), a noun/adjective pair is pluralized by pluralizing the noun, regardless of whether the adjective is post-positive or a more usual adjective.\n\nSo think about how you would pluralize \"general attorney\": You would make it \"general attorneys\".  That rule doesn't change just because the adjective is post-positive: \"attorney general\" becomes \"attorneys general\".\n\nWith that said, in many cases, English is changing/has changed so that pluralization of the post-positive adjective instead of the noun is becoming common.  So you'll hear lots of people say \"attorney generals\" and the like.  And you'll hear lots of people, in turn, complain about that.  But the one constant of language is change, and change in language is perfectly fine, despite what any stick-in-the-ass prescriptivist pedant might tell you."},
{"title":"ELI5: How does gramophone/phonograph actully work?","question_detail":"Could someone kindly explain what's the logic behind the device for those of us that don't understand the music or physics terminology?\n Thanks in advance!","answer":"On the grammophone record there is a long thin lane that goes from the outside edge to the inside. When the needle is played in this lane, it picks up little zigzags that cause the needle to vibrate which creates a sound. This sound is then amplified from the needle to the sound-funnel where you can hear the music loudly.\nThis all used to work without electricity by cranking a handle which wound up a spiral that would make the record plate spin."},

{"title":"ELI5: Would electing a 3rd party candidate in 2016 really be a smart choice?","answer":"In the current electoral system, a third party candidate is destined to failure and is actually counterproductive. By voting for a third party, you actually make it more likely that the candidate you like least will be elected. [CGP Grey explained this very well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo)\n\nSetting that aside, your main question seems to be that, assuming one actually were elected, would they be more or less productive? I would say they would struggle. In some ways, being able to ally with either of the primary parties on different issues would be an advantage. If there were enough members of the third party to make a difference in the votes, then the primary parties would have incentive to appeal to the third party's interests and make deals to accomplish their goals. However, that is unlikely. Unless the two primary parties are roughly balanced with the third party making the difference, then the two main parties have little or no incentive to pay them any attention.\n"},
{"title":"ELI5:How are shows like moonshiners legal?","question_detail":"I guess really any show that shows illegal activity.  Is it all staged?","answer":"The only real question to ask about a \"reality show\" is HOW fake is it?\n\nAt one end, the people pictured are real people who really do the things portrayed in the show, but reality is \"augmented,\" the people are coached to make situations more dramatic, some things are be scripted and staged.\n\nAt the other end, they're just pure fantasy. The \"real people\" are actors, and they're performing from a script.\n\nAnd of course, there are shades of grey in between.\n\nI'm not familiar with the inside details of the show in question, but I would guess that the moonshiners are real people who have *claimed* to the producers that they are real moonshiners (of course, the producers don't care if that's *actually* true or not), but that any scenes depicting illegal activity are completely staged. Probably with a lawyer present, maybe even with a cop present.\n\nIt's really a bit ironic, since the original appeal of reality shows for producers was that they were cheap to produce because they didn't *need* writers or actors.\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: Why are tongue twisters so hard to say?","answer":"Same reason why it's hard to do any complex task faster and faster. Tongue twisters are very easy to say at slow speeds. When you speed up, you have to have that same physical and mental accuracy and timing as you did at that slower speed. The faster you go, the harder it is to keep that same level of accuracy and timing, just like playing a piece of music on guitar or piano. Tongue twisters are like playing complex patterns of notes. Rapping really fast with less word patterns that would be considered tongue twisters is still hard and you can still twist your tongue. It's just that the word patterns that we consider tongue twisters take more mouth and tongue coordination, and speeding it up requires higher and higher levels of concentration on that physical act of making the movements and that mental act of remember what word to say and how to get your mouth to say it."},

{"title":"ELI5: If Venezuela has the world's largest oil reserves and significant gold reserves. Why is the Venezuelan GDP so low?","answer":"When people answer the question, \"what are taxes used for?\", rarely does someone offer the largest fraction as what taxes are used for, to give money to people or groups to buy political support, and usually trivial expenses are listed like roads.\n\nAssuming what most people think is a bad habit and often wrong.  Not all transfer payments are truly social welfare, and many people think Social Security is some kind of savings system.  As a class, elders are the wealthiest group of people in the nation, that wealth carries power.  Another powerful group are financial institutions (many of which are owned by senior citizens) which create inflation that disintegrates wealth and savings.  In order to offset the effects of the disintegrating policy, Social Security/public pensions are doled out to some of the most influential people in our society.\n\nSo, the wealthy and powerful are enriched or maintain status, and the young and vulnerable bear the costs."},

{"title":"ELI5: Signed zeros in float/double arithmetic?","question_detail":"This is one this I never *fully* grasped. When doing float or double arithmetic, in C, C++, Java, etc., why do negative sign zeros occur? How should they be handled when we know they should just be unsigned zero?","answer":"In floating point numbers, the leftmost bit is reserved as a sign bit. Other than that, positive and negative numbers are exactly mirrored: for example, 0.5 and -0.5 have the exact same representation except for the leftmost bit, which is 0 in 0.5 and 1 in -0.5. This is in contrast to integers, which are represented using [two's complement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement).\n\nBecause of this, the representation of 0 can either have the leftmost bit as 0 (a \"positive\" 0) or 1 (a \"negative\" 0). In contrast, an integer 0 has only one representation (applying two's complement on the integer representation of 0 will result in the same representation).\n\nThe floating point standard defines how a negative zero should be treated - for example, multiplying -0 by any negative number should result in +0 (and vice versa), and -0 == +0 should be true. You can find a list of these properties here:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_zero#Properties_and_handling"},

{"title":"ELI5: Why fixie bikes are good?","question_detail":"I get that they're fashionable, and therefore cool for whatever reason, but why do they exist in the first place?

Since they're simpler, they're less likely to break.\n\nThey originally took off as 'a thing' with bike messengers.

{"title":"ELI5:When walking on a tightrope with a long bar, why does pushing down on the long bar on the side that you are leaning help balance in the other direction?","question_detail":"why doesn't the weight on the long bar (being lower on one end) cause it to fall to a side?\n\n\n","answer":"When you are pushing on a long rod like that you create a rotational torque on said object (just rotational force), and due to Newton's Third Law, it pushes back on you and pushes you back up your rotational point (the rope). The reason the pole isn't completely tilted afterwards is because of something known as a moment of inertia (resistance to change in rotation) which is why the pole is soooooo long, because the moment of inertia is dependent on how far you can put mass away from the center point. The best way to see moment of inertia in action is when you try spinning with your arms out and then bring them in (spinning is much faster when you bring your arms in. So when you are able to center yourself again, you are able to stabilize the pole and continue your walk. :)"},

So it wouldn't have many kittens, so cats with hair that shed cleanly without matting would predominate. \n\nWe started breeding cats with thick, soft fur, because we found them more cuddly. So instead of this thick, easily matted fur dying out, it survived, so we have to comb our pets and look after their fur.\n\nThere are animals that have to have thick fur to survive the winter.

{"title":"ELI5: Why people here, in Poland, hate European Union so much?","question_detail":"Hi,\n\nI know that EU makes decisions about trivial things like banana shape or snail being a fish. I know that some of my money goes towards them, to help countries like Greece or to make the stupid laws in the first place. Why should I care? Corrupt government would take the money away from me anyway. And EU helped to build roads, stadium, sewerage in my area, paid half of the costs. I saw the numbers, for some projects they even paid one hundred percent of the needed amount. I know that each country is different, has a different culture and people. I know that some decisions, made by EU officials, (e.g. CO2 emission) made my country weaker. I know that they sometimes make dumb laws. But now I can travel without passport and work everywhere I want - in UK, Germany, whatever. And they're building the damn kindergarten next to my house. Why my right side, nacionalist-fashioned friends hate it so much? When I asked them they could only rabble and blab about how much we're going to pay for all profits in the future. I say look at the local investments. Maybe they do not make my new workplace, but without  that money aid my local community could achieve half of all those goals, or even less. I love my country, I love it's kind people, poetry, music, I think I'd have problems abandoning it. But man, they pay money, they invest here.

{"title":"ELI5: How does credit work? When I swipe my card at a company, how do they get the money?","answer":"A credit card transaction has a few different moving parts, all of which happen within milliseconds of you swiping your card.  There are also multiple parties involved in the transaction.  You, the merchant, the merchant acquirer, the network, and the issuer are all party to a single transaction.  Here is what happens when you swipe a card:\n\n\nWhen you swipe your card at a store, the merchant terminal sends an authorization request to the payment network (MasterCard, Visa).\n\nThe network routes the request to the issuing bank for authorization.  The Network knows which bank issued the card by the first 6 digits of the card number, which is the Bank Identification Number (BIN).\n\nThe issuing bank sees the authorization request, and compares the auth against the open credit limit to make sure you have enough room for the transaction.  It also applies a few algorithms to your transaction to determine if it is fraud.  If everything checks out, the issuing bank approves the transaction and sends confirmation through the payment network back to the merchant terminal, at which point you can sign and complete the transaction.\n\nHow does the merchant get paid?  Lets say you bought a $3 coffee and swiped your card, and the transaction was approved as per the above.  Every day your issuing bank (Chase/CapitalOne/etc.) settles with Visa and/or MasterCard.  Visa takes money from your bank and gives it to the Merchant's Acquirer, and the Merchant Acquirer takes the money and deposits it into the merchant's bank account.  Often the merchant's acquirer is also the merchant's bank, but it doesn't have to be.  Some companies just perform merchant services (operating the terminals and processing payments) without holding the merchant's deposits\n\nWho makes money on this?  The merchant pays fees to the acquirer.  This merchant fee is then shared amongst the Acquirer, the Network, and the Issuing bank.  Everyone gets a piece of the action.\n\nSource:  I'm an experienced mgr with an issuing bank.  AMA credit-card or banking related"},

Liquid conductors and gas conductors, electric current refers to electrons and protons flow in the opposite direction\n\nCurrent is flow of electrons, but current and electron flow in the opposite direction. Current flows from positive to negative and electron flows from negative to positive.","answer":"When scientists first started to study electricity, they assumed that the positive charges were what moved. They called this positive to negative motion current.\n\nLater on, they figured out that protons (positive charge) don't move, and that it is the much smaller electrons (negative charge) that are actually moving around. That meant that the negative charge was really moving towards the positive charge. This is electron flow.\n\nBut everyone had already gotten used to the idea of positive to negative motion, so they decided to just stick with it. Today when we describe charges moving, we talk about the positive to negative current, even though in our heads we know that the electrons are really moving in the opposite direction.  "},

{"title":"ELI5: Why is it harder to sing an 'H' sound when near your vocal limits?","question_detail":"Kind of a confusing title, because I'm not the best with explanations.\n\nSo imagine you're singing really high, and you have a lyric that starts with 'H'. It takes more vocal prowess to be able to make the 'H' sound while retaining your mouth shape and air flow.\n\nWhy is that?","answer":"Ok, the best way to explain this is to have you do it, and feel what your throat is doing.\n\nIf you make an aspirated \"H\" sound, it normally has no frequency.  Make an H sound without singing or saying anything, and you'll notice how your mouth acts as a resonator-amplifier to a sound that sounds like \"white noise\" made by partly closing off your air flow (You should feel the back of your tongue closing off the flow.\n\nNow, try to hold any note while making the \"H\" sound.  It's harder, because you have to make the note, but you're still closing off your airway and moving your tongue.  For low notes, your airway opening doesn't affect the pitch very much.\n\nBUT.\n\nFor high frequencies notes, the diameter of your throat and the resonating cavity of your mouth can make HUGE differences in the pitch, because the wavelengths of sound are so much smaller.  Now, when you're singing a high note, and your tongue moves back to close off the airway, you can easily change the pitch resonating in your mouth, while at the same time not exhaling enough air to clearly generate the randomized white-noise sound for the aspirated \"H\".  That's why it's harder to sing an \"H\" high, while vowels sounds, which have fixed mouth shapes and near pure tones is a lot easier, and any sound that involves lip changes are also easy enough to do."},

I do not have a background in track and field, but I have wondered for a while why track sprinters start with both hands down (\"four-point takeoff\").\n\nI figure it has to do with the starting blocks, which sprinters get, but football players don't, but I don't really see how that affects the athletes starting motion.  Is it a rule in track and field that all four points be on the ground?","answer":"The reason they'd do it in the combine is because how fast a football player is from a four-point stance is irrelevant if he'll never actually do that in a game.  It's pointless to test someone on something you know they aren't going to do. And since everyone is using a three-point stance, everyone is on a level playing field--it's still a fair test."},

Also, in high fashion segments, you can also find dry clean only t-shirts, sometimes it's synthetic fiber blended with cotton, but they are not necessarily more expensive to produce, it's simply based on the fact that customers may see the washing label and think clothings that require dry cleaning as high quality products.

{"title":"ELI5: Why do we get that feeling in our stomachs' when we go over a hill while driving?","answer":"When you go over a hill you travel in a partial arc - think of it like a parabola or a segment of a circle. Doing so causes you to feel a force perpendicular to the direction of motion. In this case, that force vector points up toward the sky. That force cancels out the gravitational force that you feel, which causes an odd feeling in your stomach.

{"title":"ELI5: Prisoner's Dilemma, why is confession the dominant strategy?","question_detail":"I understand via the Nash equilibrium that each player wants to maximise their individual payoff and choose the dominant strategy (confess, confess) In equilibrium, they receive a jointly, worse off payoff. Thus, why isn't ( don't confess, don't confess) considered the dominant strategy instead.","answer":"For each individual player, confessing provides a better outcome no matter what the other person does.  If the other player stays silent, we can get a shorter sentence if we confess and if the other player confesses, we can also get a shorter sentence by also confessing.

{"title":"ELI5: Blizzard continues to develop WoW in such a way that is losing players","question_detail":"Let me just preface this with the understanding that the loss of WoWs playerbase isn't entirely due to the way they have developed the game..\n\nSo I watched a video today over it /r/wow and it portrayed WoW subscribers alongside patches/expansions and it got me wondering: Why haven't blizzard taken a gamble and gone back to the style of vanilla WoW and TBC (and I guess to an extent WOTLK) whereby there is a real challenge to the game? The numbers show a very real decline coinciding with so called \"dumbing down\" of the game yet they continue to state that this is what people what and they will continue to do so. Is the haemorrhaging exclusive from the way they are catering to casual players or is the way they are developing a cost cutting measure which allows them to make do with the declining subscriber base?\n\nanyway hope that makes sense.. ELI5! <3 ","answer":"Because at the end of the day they command a massive amount of subscribers and people who pay for the game (such as in asian markets).\n\nThey are making money hand over fist with the game.  However remember that a lot of people dont have all the numbers or reasons why people are leaving.  Blizzard could be finding that a certain turnover is what they are expecting.  Also remember that at the end of this year wow will be 10 years old.\n\nthats a mighty long time to have that many people sub your game.   Even if they went down to 2 million players world wide and averaged 12 bucks a month from them they would make 288 million a year, so im pretty sure they arnt that concerned.  At this point WoW is a cash cow."},
{"title":"ELI5: Why are there car dealers and why can't we just buy cars directly from the companies that make them?","answer":"Dealerships existed before cars.

It just evolved.\nI think its something past its prime.   People HATE dealerships.  A true workable system where-this is the price, we guarantee you aren't getting screwed, have a nice day.

If more takes are required, they're rescheduled until the actor is willing to eat more. This seems highly impractical and therefore improbable.\n\n2. The food isn't real food but tofu or something. No calories, can eat for hours without filling up.\n\n3. The actor doesn't actually eat the food but dislodges it behind their cheeks like a squirrel and then spits it out after the take. \n\n4.

The actors are hardcore.","answer":"I recall one instance in which a young woman talked in the extras about having to shoot several takes of a scene during which she has to eat a decadent dessert.

{"title":"ELI5:How do bugs occur in games even though they are not in the Code itself","answer":"Lets say you have a simple code\n\n1 + x = y\n\nWhen you input an X you get result Y. Then you add another part of code using the same variables\n\n1/x = y\n\nSuddenly your code wont work whenever the user inputs X as 0.

Suddenly your code wont work properly because in the first part of the code cannot input 0 (which is essentiall for the type of work the program is designed for).\n\nNow those are all ridicules mistakes made maybe a 10 year old. But what I tried to show is that 1 change in code can affect all manner of different processes in that code.

{"title":"ELI5: The ending to Shawshank Redemption (Spoilers)","question_detail":"**Spoilers! Obviously...**\n\nMy knowledge of money is extremely basic, so could someone explain how our protagonist was able to start a new life under someone he made up? And why did the prison need to make fake account things to cover up their tracks?\n\n:(","answer":"The accounts were needed because the money came from bribery and corruption. The prisoners were being used for public works, but the warden took bribes to avoid certain jobs (so a private contractor could keep it). He presumably also took jobs to hurt the competition (if you payed him enough), or did cheap work for private individuals. The person this was hidden under allowed Andy to disappear because it involved all real documents. You used to be able to get various forms of ID through the mail, just by providing a little information or another form of ID. The system wasn't designed as a whole though, it was all broken up. So you could sometimes fool it by starting with a drivers license and library card, which required no ID, and then work your way up, obtaining a birth certificate and social security number. "},

{"title":"ELI5:Canadian First Nations","question_detail":"Recently began working for a company in Northern Ontario and I don't understand the issues that the first nations people face, their primary concerns, what they hope to accomplish, the Canadian government's role in the communities, Idle no More, etc.","answer":"Decades—if not centuries—of institutionalized cultural oppression, forced re-locations, exceptional mortality rates (historically, both intentional and inadvertently through by disease to which they had no immunity; today as a result of poverty, poor housing, and an alarming suicide rate), persistent and powerful stereotypes, and generations of children being taken from their homes and communities has led to an understandable level of anger and frustration (to put it mildly). \n\nDespite all these things, many aboriginal peoples and communities have held on to their culture, sometimes by a thread. Not being aboriginal myself, it has seemed to me that what they hope to accomplish is a level of acceptance and support by other corners of Canadian society that would permit them to rekindle that nearly lost way of life. It is an oversimplification, but an easy comparison between that culture and the \"Western\" culture that exists here has a lot to do with one's relationship to the land, the planet, and the creatures that inhabit it.\n\nAs for the government's role, that too is a long story but the gist is that the federal government is responsible for the execution of treaty rights (agreements made by aboriginal groups between the early 18th century and the modern day often to permit western settlement) on behalf of the non-aboriginal signatories. Originally that meant the British Crown but as Canada left the empire, responsibilities transferred to Ottawa. From a more practical perspective, the federal government has the responsibility to provide things like housing, education and health care, sometimes as a result of the original treaty agreements, and sometimes because it was the government's inattention, attempts at cultural eradication, and disruption to the land upon which those groups traditionally relied for their food and livelihood, that put them at a difficult position today. Considering the rocky past between aboriginal communities and the federal government, that relationship remains strained, and mired by issues of trust, respect and either party's responsibilities."},

","answer":"Blazers and sports jackets do not come with matching trousers.\n\nSports jackets tend to be made of heavier, rougher material. Think tweed and corduroy. They have a more casual cut than a suit jacket, and are considered to be far less formal than a suit jacket or a blazer.\n\nWhile blazers are more formal than a sport jacket, they still have a more casual cut than a suit jacket, and again, have no matching trousers.  They are generally made of a smooth material and will often have metal buttons, silver or brass.  They also may, or may not, have a crest or patch on the pocket.  Think school uniforms and such.\n\nA suit jacket has more structure to it, it's less casual, more tailored and comes with matching trousers.

{"title":"ELI5: Why do pixels appear to have different color when seen from an angle?","question_detail":"Generally speaking, the colors appear to be darker if you move your head up or down.","answer":"Not all monitors produce this effect to the same degree, the darkening of the screen or distortion of colors is largely to do with the viewing angle of the display. regular monitors use TN Panels, these have the advantage of being able to switch pixels on and off very quickly, but generally not as accurately as other panels.. e.g. IPS panel. TN panels generally have a very limited viewing angle so it is where you are most likely to see the darkening effect when viewing from extra angles.\n\nHere is a list of some of the panel types: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin-film-transistor_liquid-crystal_display#Types\n\nI know this doesnt answer how it becomes darker, think of it as placing as a tube infront of a lamp, if you make the tube relatively long compared to the size of the lamp.. you will only be able to see the light if you are directly infront of the lamp, but as you progressively shortening the tube, you will be able to see light from wider angles..\n\nThis is by far an over simplification, and it's in reality not tiny tubes in your monitor, but light scattering through thinner/thicker crystals in the liquid crystal display.\n\nHope this helps you to understand, if you are more interested this guy on youtube builds his own simple LCD displays, might help you understand the basic operation of LCD panels.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4QFNWBSZYg\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zoeeR3geTA"},

It is perfectly explained.\n\nIn a nutshell; assuming 10 chimps made 100 off-spring, 90 of them are prettier than normal, 10 of them are uglier than normal. The uglier ones don't find a mate and make no off-spring. The 90 prettier ones do. These 90 pretty ones make 200 off-spring, of these 200, 170 are even more pretty than their parents, the other 30 are uglier than their parents. The ugly ones don't find mates, while the 170 reproduce further.\n\nIf you continue this for 100's of thousands of years, intermediate species all go extinct.\n\nNow if you ask why chimpanzee's still exist and humans too; just because a species CAN mutate, it doesn't always mean it does. In the above example, let's 100 chimp off-spring 40 are \"prettier\", 40 are \"normal\" and 20 are \"uglier\". Again, ugly does not survive as they dont mate to sustain their existence. In the meantime pretty mates with pretty and normal with normal. This where they start \"branching\" and the process starts over.\n\nThis is called natural selection."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why have we decided to go for rectangular videos rather than circular?","answer":"Sure.  It goes back to the pre-video days of film and photography though.

Also, if you've ever looked at the edges of a film frame, they're not perfectly square, and there's a lot of grime and blur that appears.

{"title":"ELI5: If I were to brush my teeth once every hour, would it be more effective than twice a day?","answer":"No.  You would irritate the gums and be at much more risk for having a receding gumline due to over brushing.  Also, it's actually better to brush *before* a meal and then use floss or toothpicks to clear up any food that's stuck between teeth.\n\nThis is because brushing before a meal cleans off a lot of the bacteria that react with food and it's the acid created by these bacteria that causes tooth decay.  By getting the bacteria off before eating, you eliminate a lot of the acid they produce.  Also, since they begin producing acid right away (as soon as there are food particles for them to feed on), teeth are actually at their weakest immediately after eating and brushing then can increase that amount of enamel erosion you experience.\n\nThe best solution is generally to brush 15-30 minutes before eating (basically to give enough time for the toothpaste taste to wear off).\n\nhttp://www.rdhmag.com/articles/print/volume-24/issue-2/columns/periodontics/brush-before-eating.html"},
{"title":"ELI5: What the numbers that dentists say mean","question_detail":"Whenever I go to the dentist and he looks at my teeth he says things like, '2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1.'\n\nWhat does this mean?","answer":"They're measuring the depth of the pockets in your gums around your teeth.  Anything 3 or less is considered pretty good.  Anything deeper than 3mm is difficult to clean properly and can lead to serious problems down the line.\n\nAs a general rule, don't hesitate to ask medical professionals what they're doing to you.  You have a right to know &amp; it's their job to explain what's going on.  If you don't like what they're doing, in most cases, you have the right to stop them from doing it."},

Each areas soil is determined by the local rock makeup and other environment factors. There is not relay that much of it. There is a very tiny layer wrapped around a again small solid crust and we are all crawling around on top not really any the wiser or it."},

They are just trying to make more money this way, but I guess the real question is: \"how much does 3G REALLY cost, anyway?\"\n\nI know it's a bit unfair that I'm comparing Kindles to smartphones, but if the normal [Kindle Paperwhite](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AWH595M/ref=fs_clw) costs $119 and the[ Paperwhite 3G](http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-3G-Ereader/dp/B00BTI6HBS/) costs $189, I'm sure most people will be willing to pay the $70 difference just to avoid the monthly 3G fees afterwards.

{"title":"ELI5: when people are bleeding yo death, why can't we just bathe them in a nutrient rich bath to keep them alive?","question_detail":"Whether it's an artificial bath, or just lots of donor blood. \n\nAlso, could you survive without breathing if you had oxygen rich blood cycling through a machine to externally keep it oxygenated before going back into you? Removing toxins of course, too.","answer":"So if some dude was blown in half (top half still intact), with his guts hanging out, normally he'd be condemned to death. \n\nBut if we were to just stop all of the bleeding and start repairing tissue, then he could potentially survive. And the bleeding could be -- hypothetically -- stopped if we simply just submerged him in a oxygen and nutrient rich bath of artificial or real blood, with enough pressure to permeate his tissues and remaining vessels, capillary beds, etc. Because bleeding in this sense is: he's bleeding so much, his body has nowhere to transfer the oxygen and no way to transport it. \n\nCouldn't, theoretically, his heart stop, and as long as the oxygen kept getting to where it needed to be? The heart isn't essential to our perception of life, our brain is. The heart stopping will cause death, but that's because it's the only way the body can deliver nutrients and oxygen. But what if we skipped the heart and just bathed everything in blood like some organisms do? \n\nSomebody should look into this science. I think I have a great plan here. "},

{"title":"ELI5: Why do memories feel like they happened yesterday?","question_detail":"You know the saying \"It feels just like yesterday...\"","answer":"Unlike a computer, the brain does not have an intrinsic way to chronologically arrange memories. So a strong memory 20 years ago may feel more recent than a weak memory 3 days ago. We do not have a big \"timeline\" and put every memory inside it; we remember when it happened only because a date is part of the memory, or something date-able is closely associated to it."},

{"title":"ELI5 how does political lobbying work in America.","question_detail":"I am not American and I am a little confused as how lobbying works. From my own research I see that anyone can be a lobbyist even the average man that writes a letter to persuade law makers.   \n  \nMy confusion is regarding how the 1% and the big money companies have more influence then the general public since it is against the law to spend that money on any member of congress.  \n  \n\" Member of Congress or their staff may not accept a gift from a registered lobbyist or any organization that employs lobbyists. The term “gift” covers any gratuity, favor, discount, entertainment, hospitality, loan, or other item having monetary value.\"  \n  \nWhat am I missing?  \n  \nThis (really cool) website got me thinking.. http://mayone.us/","answer":"It used to be not such a big deal, because there were limits on campaign contributions, and companies didn't get that huge, and candidates were elected based on their own merits, not which party they are in.  Since the 70s, the American political parties have polarized like nobody's business. They used to be internally very diverse, but now they are monolithic, and with every new election they get more and more radical on the political spectrum, because of the primary system (together with gerrymandering) that makes being absolutely crazy radical the only way to win elections. "},
{"title":"ELI5:Are bitcoins and the traditional banks at odds?","answer":"Yes and governments too. They overlap in lots of ways because of the way a currency is expected to be used but that's not all, the biggest way they differ is in the actual point of creating and distributing the money supply which leads people to ask really big questions about what money is and what it should be, where it should come from and who should control it. \n\nLay people didn't really question money as much before bitcoin was released because the current money system had no real competition, now there is an alternative, the people with ultimate power won't willingly give it up or openly admit their competitors strengths."},

{"title":"ELI5: What is the point of laugh tracks in comedy shows?","question_detail":"Are they suppose to add the the comedy (that is sometimes nonexistent) or are they suppose to give the allusion of an actual studio audience watching the show?","answer":"This. It's less comfortable to laugh alone. \n\nAlso, not all audiences are mic'ed up. In the case of a standup show, a performer's bit or routine relies heavily on audience participation and reaction; without this reaction, a performer appears much less funny.\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5:Why don't you lose control of your bodily functions when you're under anesthesia for a long time? Or am I being cathetered without my knowledge?","question_detail":"This has always confused me. Explanation would be helpful!","answer":"I don't KNOW, but I'll hazard a guess: \n\n(Under the assumption that you're referring to general anaesthesia)\n\nWe have two nervous systems, the autonomic (which takes care of everything you don't think about - breathing, heartbeats, intestinal movements and such) and the somatic nervous system (which makes you able to feel and react to stimuly - i.e. move a muscle.)\n\nI'd guess that only the somatic nervous system goes down for at reboot when you're under, but it's just a guess."},

{"title":"ELI5: VEVO on YouTube","question_detail":"Edit: What is it, what does it do, why has it taken over every single artists page, and why is it necessary?","answer":"Also, VEVO does not \"take over\". Videos get submitted by label companies and partners of VEVO, VEVO then uploads those videos to YouTube, and at the same time processes every single video - it gets encoded for every platform that VEVO has apps for.\nAt least third of all the YouTube content is VEVO Music Videos.\nPeople complain about censored videos on YouTube, or availability of videos in different countries.

{"title":"ELI5: How does a spontaneous pneumothorax happen? And why only to specific body types.","question_detail":"Why does it mostly occur to tall & young men?","answer":"I can't do that anyway for other medical reasons. My case is probably different than yours. My Doctor's at the time said I would be able to but that is because I was infected and they had to open me up, remove the infection, dump lots of antibiotic powder inside and pray for the best. As they cleaned out the infection in the process they washed off outer surface of lung this caused extensive scarring with all the trauma from infection and washing it off. That is why he said I could, as even if I did the scarring was bad enough the lung would probably never collapse again. Don't know if it's true but told me in the old west with cowboys smoking so much and just hard living that after they reached mid 30's their lungs were so stiff that was why even with a gunshot to chest damaging the lung if they didn't bleed out their lungs usually didn't collapse as too stiff to collapse. May just have been a pile of manure story but it is what he told me. Hope this helps but easiest to just ask your doctor. Each case different. Good luck."},

{"title":"ELI5: How does Encryption work and how is this used in passwords for online services (like reddit)","question_detail":"Now, when I say how it is used in online services, I mean how can the password be encrypted then when the user attempts to log in to the service with their password, how can they check that the password is correct if the password in the database is encrypted?\n\nSorry, I just didn't really know how to word it as such.","answer":"Passwords are generally not encrypted. They are hashed. A hash function is an algorithm that takes the password and transforms it into a string of apparently random data, with the property that it is very hard to turn the data back to the password. This is in contrast to encryption, where the original information can be recovered if you know the key.\n\n\n\nTo check that the password is correct, it is hashed, and then compared against the stored hash value in the database. If they match, then it is assumed that the password was correct. It is possible, though exceedingly unlikely, for an incorrect password to pass this test, if it hashes to the same value. This is called a collision, and for secure hash functions the probablility of it happening is negligible.\n\n\nThe advantage of hashing over encryption is that if an attacker is able to recover an encryption key, they are then able to decrypt every password on the site, whereas hashed passwords must be cracked individually, taking far longer.\n\n\nSome [websites](http://plaintextoffenders.com/) neither hash nor encrypt their passwords. This is terribly insecure but still fairly common, even for large organisations that should know better."},

However, I don't find this explanation intuitive because you can still get this effect from a bottle which stands on a table and thereby cannot move downward. What is the actual cause of the foaming from something so seemingly simple as a knock on the top of the bottle?","answer":"I will cede your point, due to lack of scientific knowledge.

Why is that?","answer":"When you workout, your body has to move around fluids to maintain homeostasis (balance). The lungs and throat, ironically, are one of the very first places it pulls water from. When the water gets extracted and sent to your muscles, the secretions in your saliva and nose become thicker. The more the fluid is pulled, the thicker it becomes.\n\nThings to combat this problem are increasing your hydration and decreasing dairy intake before a workout."},
{"title":"ELI5:If there are currently no \"internet fast/slow lanes\" why does my ISP charge different rates for different speeds? How is charging me for different speeds different from charging content providers?","answer":"It's different because if you paid for your network speed and the provider you're accessing pays for his network speed, the connection between you has been paid for twice.\n\nActually, the content provider already paid for its line to the internet in some way already; the \"fast lane\" refers to routing traffic by a third party. That means that the content provider would already pay for the traffic twice.\n\nAlso, if you paid for a certain network speed, and your ISP limits the content provider because it didn't pay to be on the \"fast lane\", you're not getting what you paid for.\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: How do magicians move a card from the deck to somewhere completely else?","question_detail":"Either all videos are fakes or there's as trick to it. They ask you to choose a card, the other one does and the magician tells him to put the card back into the deck and then the magician pulls the one card  out of a lemon or something similar. ","answer":"&gt; In the UK, professional magicians are members of an organisation called \"The Magic Circle\" which promotes their interests. \n\nThe Magic Circle is just another social club for magicians, and not all magicians--professional or otherwise--belong to it. \n\nI used to belong to the Academy of Magical Arts, whose home is the famous Magic Castle in Hollywood. Most of these clubs have language in their membership applications saying that revealing tricks is a no-no, but they rarely do anything about it beyond a little harrumphing and tut-tutting. They have *ZERO* authority over the professional careers of their members, they're just social clubs.\n\n&gt; and expulsion from the Magic Circle -- and all that implies about not being able to get bookings and such\n\nHorseshit. No booker I've ever met gives a rat's ass what magic clubs you belong to. Being publicly kicked out of one would probably *increase* your appeal, it would imply you're an edgy rebel.\n\n&gt;Ha ha! No.\n\nSeriously? You're going to say THAT to an actual, for-real magician, one who has a wall full of magic books, a rack of tapes and DVDs on magic technique, and boxes upon boxes of magic tricks bought from magic stores or online, all gotten without ever showing my Secret Magician Club Card?\n\nReally? I mean, I know this is the internet, where one is kinda expected to blather on about things of which one is utterly ignorant, but you might wanna dial it back a skosh when in the presence of *actual* experts, K?\n\n&gt;You can go into any bookstore or magic shop and walk out with an afternoon of the \n&gt;simplest card tricks and mind-reading acts, the stuff that is so easy, it's almost \n&gt;considered common knowledge, \n\nYou can buy lots of basic books, yeah. But you can also buy books at any other level of magic (up to and including books by Jim Steinmeyer, perhaps the most successful and innovative magic illusion designer of the last 100 years). See, here's the thing: there's not a whole lot that's genuinely NEW under the sun in the magic world. Yeah, every once in awhile, somebody comes up with a new gimmick or routine, but about 90% of modern professional magic would be familiar to a magician from the 1920s. And when somebody DOES come up with something genuinely new, it's usually not long before they either publish the details, or the magic community has it figured out. \n\nDavid Copperfield has never published a book on how he does his flying illusion (although there *is* a patent--with drawings--on file, if you know where to look), but any competent magician can watch it a few times and have it completely figured out. Indeed, Copperfield has sued more than one other magician for ripping off that trick. \n\nDitto for Penn &amp; Teller's bullet catch. That trick dates back more than a century (and has killed at least 13 people), but they came up with a new way of doing it. They've never published it, but again, any competent magician can figure it out. It took me about three viewings before I'd worked out all the details.\n\n&gt;Books like this are written by magicians, and they're not going to scupper their own acts by revealing to a general \n&gt;audience how they perform the tricks and illusions that earn them money on stage. \n\nOnce again: nope. They do this *ALL THE TIME.* The books and lecture notes they publish are not meant for \"general audiences,\" but there are no restrictions on where or to whom they sell them. They just rely on the fact that the general public is grotesquely ignorant about just how much of magic is written down and freely available (well, available for money, anyway) to anyone--as amply demonstrated here.\n\nHere's the real bottom line here: the REAL secret of magic is not the trick, but the performance, and any decent magician knows this. Guys like Jason Latimer, Lennart Green, Guy Hollingworth, Michael Close, et al, who have either come up with entirely new ways of doing old tricks, or have invented completely new moves, have no qualms whatsoever about sharing or even publishing the details, because they know good magicians will want their OWN acts, and hack magicians won't be able to perform the tricks as well.\n\n\n\n"},

I'm off for a Google !\n\nAt a meeting of the Privy Council on 17 July 1917, George V declared that 'all descendants in the male line of Queen Victoria, who are subjects of these realms, other than female descendants who marry or who have married, shall bear the name of Windsor'. \n\nAs for the 'Wales' boys ...\n\nThey actually have a choice - they could have opted for Windsor, or Mountbatten-Windsor, but may have chosen Wales as both easy to use, well known, and not so obviously \"royal.\" When William joined the forces, he didn't have the Cambridge title, or the ones that go with it, so that wasn't then an option. \n"},

The process isn't really perfect as we do aspirate sometimes when drinking and we find ourselves having to burp up air that ends up in our stomach.  So, if the brain has a hard enough time doing this while awake, it's understandable that it cannot always regulate it while sleeping. So the flap relaxes into a position that's about halfway and when you inhale it vibrates due to the changing pressure much like a kazoo."},

While some of it is very impressive, most of it goes over my (bourgeois) head.","answer":"Having never heard of the man myself, [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerhard_Richter#Recognition) suggests that he really gained his status as a pre-eminent contemporary artist after a 2002 (wikipedia incorrectly says 2005) retrospective that started in the MoMA in NY and traveled to several world renowned US art museums. They also bring up the point that he is a talented painter during a time when painting as a medium seems to be declining. At any rate, fame is a fickle mistress that does not necessarily correlate with talent. Regardless of his own skill, it seems as if he gained a lot of exposure at a time when there weren't a lot of other painters on the scene so he much more easily stood out."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why do every software need me to restart the computer before the installation is completed?","answer":"The reason for the restart varies. Sometimes it is because it needs to alter core files that the system uses to keep things running. To make the OS stable the system won't allow those files to be altered while it is running. So when you restart it makes those files able to be modified to incorporate the program into the rest of the system.

For instance, a guy has a sports store, he buys stock, including a bunch of these helmets.  His store goes under and he has to liquidate his assets to pay his creditors. \n\nAll these brand new helmets have to be sold immediately, and nobody is going to make a business out of paying the same price anyone could get them for from distribution, because then why not just get them that way?\n\nSo they end up buying all their helmets at $75 per, the company (or receiver) is satisfied because you can't pay bills with helmets.  \n\nThe brokers deal in such a wide variety (and sometimes variable quality) of goods that they can't sell things by normal channels, so they end up selling their goods on ebay, or spamming.\n\nAlso theft."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why do people cry? Are you denying yourself something if you \"keep it in?\"","question_detail":"What does crying accomplish? Are people who \"keep it in\" denying themselves something?","answer":"*Crying does serve an emotional purpose, says Sideroff, also an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine. \"It's a release. There is a buildup of energy with feelings.\"*\n\n*It can also be a survival mechanism, notes Jodi DeLuca, PhD, a neuropsychologist at Tampa General Hospital in Florida. ''When you cry,\" she says, \"it's a signal you need to address something.\" Among other things, it may mean you are frustrated, overwhelmed or even just trying to get someone's attention, which DeLuca and other researchers call a ''secondary gain'' cry.*\n\n*On top of that, crying may have a biochemical purpose. It's believed to release stress hormones or toxins from the body, says Lauren Bylsma, a PhD student at the University of South Florida in Tampa, who has focused on crying in her research.*\n\n*Lastly, crying has a purely social function, Bylsma says. It often wins support from those who watch you cry. Sometimes, crying may be manipulative -- a way to get what you want, whether you're asking a friend to go shopping with you, your spouse to agree to a luxurious vacation, or your child to get their math homework done.*\n\nhttp://www.webmd.com/balance/features/why-we-cry-the-truth-about-tearing-up"},

Or90%? or 80%?\n\nI hope you understood my question.","answer":"But it does make a HUGE difference. Playing on authentic instruments isn't just about timbre - unless your definition of timbre encompasses articulation, volume, phrasing/rhetoric etc etc. If we took a piece written for baroque oboe, and tried to play it authentically on modern oboe it would be nearly impossible. There is no way you could play it with correct articulation - the modern oboe is not set up for it because the reed is much harder and much narrower, thus making it impossible to use the uneven 'tu-ru' tonguing pattern. The sound is completely different - baroque instruments were set up with a focus on rhetoric and uneven sound, whereas nowadays it is more about sustained sound and evenness. \n\nSo, say you perform a Telemann flute sonata on a modern flute. The sound will be well projected, even on every pitch, pitched at 440/442, in even temperament, and be more pure/less mellow. It would have been written as a piece of rhetoric (this is perhaps the most important aspect of understanding Baroque music). The modern flute wouldn't have the unevenness of sound which gives the piece its shape and meaning (so it can be understood by the rhetorically-informed audience, which pretty much doesn't exist nowadays). It would be impossible to perform the piece 'correctly' because modern flute doesn't have the timbrally 'weak' notes that are characteristic of baroque flute. Telemann would have written the piece with this in mind. It's kind of like the difference between bel canto and pre-bel canto. Priorities were different, leading to a different timbres.\n\nComposers write music with a particular sound in mind - the timbre difference between historic and modern instruments is HUGE. Example - you wouldn't want a shawm or a hautboy hacking their way through the Strauss oboe concerto. Compare the sound difference of Heinz Holliger to Marcel Ponseele - now imagine both playing the mozart oboe concerto mvt 2. Or a baroque orchestra (mellower) to a modern (thinner, brighter timbre). Timbre is important. Composers also had to write differently for historic instruments than they do for the same effect in modern e.g. terraced dynamics.\n\nIf it weren't important, people wouldn't dedicate their lives learning how to play historic instruments in the first place."},

{"title":"ELI5: Is there a difference between moving at a constant speed and acceleration? (in the context of physics, speed of light etc)","question_detail":"I think there is.  I always thought acceleration meant increasing speed, going faster.  But I get confused sometimes(?) when I read about the effects movement has on time in the theory of relativity.  Sometimes when people talk about time dilation all you have to do is be moving relative to something else, not necessarily constantly gaining speed.  Anyone?","answer":"As others have described, acceleration is a chance in velocity. So a constant speed would imply that acceleration is 0. \n\nI'll try and clear up your confusion with relativity(don't worry, it's a highly confusing subject). In physics, when dealing with things that are big(not microscopic) and fast(significant fraction of the speed of light) then you can't use classical mechanics(Newton's laws, what your learned in high school, etc) to describe things accurately, instead you have to start using different physics to describe what happens. This is where Special and General relativity come into play. General relativity is called such because it can always be applied to anything*(there are some extremes where GR starts to fail, mainly when trying to combine it with Quantum Mechanics). Special Relativity is special because it only deals with inertial reference frames. This means that there's no net force acting, and as such there's no net acceleration. \n\nI'm not gonna go into G.R. because the math is not ELI5 friendly, but in short higher gravitational potential/acceleration causes time dilation. S.R. is much easier, as you only need to know the Pythagorean Theorem. Again, i'm not going to go into the math(I can if you want me to though) because it's lengthy. What S.R. says is that as an object's speed approaches the speed of light, it experiences time dilation, and its length in the direction of motion gets contracted. The nice thing about S.R. is that if you take the classical limit(make the speed tiny compared to the speed of light) then you end up with all the classical physics formulas."},
{"title":"ELI5: Why do clouds are/seem white in daytime but black at night?","answer":"Because the light of the sun or the reflected light of the sun in the surface of the moon hits the particles that form the clouds and reflect that light back. When clouds look darker it is because the particles that form the clouds aren't reflecting light wich happens when there is no light to reflect, there are particles that are already reflecting that light but it is reflected towards a place were our eyes can catch it and no light traspasses those particles to the ones that are pointing to us (like when you use your hand to cover your eyes from the sun, the upper part is lighted but the back of the hand isn't), or because the particles that form the cloud are mixed with particles (like dust) that don't reflect enough light for us to see it. \nAlso the density of the clouds has an effect in the amount of light that passes throught between them."},

","answer":"Again, Zionism didn't say \"Palestine belongs to us\", it said \"We should create a homeland for the Jews in the histroical land of Israel\". How this was to be achieved was through legal purchases of land and settling in uninhabited lands. And again, the person who led the Zionist movement was an atheist.\n\nHerzl didn't propose to conquer a foreign country, mainly because (and I quote from my other comment):\n\n- Palestine wasn't an indepedent state. It was a region of the Ottoman Empire in which both Jews and Arabs lived.\n- The lands in which they settled were purchased legally from their owners.\n- The lands that were settled were empty - Arabs were not kicked out of their homes to make room for the Jews (this happened much, much later, and was the result of the conflict between the Jews and Arabs, not as an objective of Zionism)."},

{"title":"ELI5: If a baby is breastfed, it has the mother's immune system for approximately six months. Why doesn't it just keep it? Why isn't that information passed to the newborn?","answer":"This is a huge oversimplification of what's going on between mother and infant. We don't get our mother's immune system from breastfeeding.\n\nNewborns have an extremely limited immune system. The immune system is way, way too big to explain in an ELI5. But very simply, you need white blood cells. None of these cells can be passed from mother to child. Among many their many functions, white blood cells produce \"antibodies\", immunoglobulin proteins that defend against infection. These *can* be passed from mother to child. Antibodies provide a small measure of immunity until the infant's immune system can take over.\n\nDuring pregnancy, one type of antibody (Immunnoglobulin G, or IgG) crosses the placenta and enters the fetus. It makes for a passive, static immune defense. This is the main antibody of the immune system, and circulates throughout the body. It only lasts for a few months, so \"6 months\" after birth you've lost this protection. None of the cells that actually make antibodies cross the placenta, so the \"blueprints\" for these antibodies are not passed down.\n\nBreast milk doesn't contain any of the cells of the immune system. But it does contains a type of antibody, \"secretory IgA\". This is the antibody responsible for protecting mucous membranes, like those found in the lungs, digestive tract, and urinary tract. The sIgA in milk coats the surfaces of the digestive tract, protecting the infant against infection until the \"gut flora\" (good bacteria) and the infant's own sIgA are ready. Note that breast milk only protects the *digestive tract*, not the lungs or urinary tract, so infants are vulnerable to infections in those areas.\n\nTL;DR None of the immune system is actually passed down, just come protective proteins. Our own immune system is infinitely better than our mother's milk at protecting us."},

The point at the top is \"peak oil\".\n\nAs we head down the slope we're going to - some would say - see skyrocketing oil prices and we'll ultimately end up in a character in mad max, beyond thunderdome."},

The female cum combining with the male sperm possibly aids in getting the sperm into the uterus. The female cum could have nutrients that could help the sperm live for a little while while traveling.\n\nKeep in mind I dont know shit lol."},

{"title":"ELI5: How come when I suck on on ice lolly/popsicle it leaves behind colourless and tasteless ice?","question_detail":"I'm just wondering why this happens.  Are the ice and flavouring / colouring still separated,  and hust seem to be mixed together?","answer":"Different types of materials in the ice lolly/popsicle has different temperatures at which they change state from solid (ice) to liquid.\n\nAn easy demonstration of said principle can be done simply by taking a large container, filling it a quarter or a fifth of the way up with a diet coke product (others are possible, but this one I know for a fact works) and put it in the freezer.\n\nThe next day, when completely solid, remove the container and you will have an \"ice cube\" made of diet coke. Now, let it sit at room temperature and slowly melt, and periodically, like every 10 minuts (depending on the size of the cube) and pour away the liquid into a glass, get a new glass each and every time.\n\nYou will find that the longer time that passes, the more watery and diluted the liquid in the glass becomes, as the flavouring of the diet coke will melt way earlier than the water content, meaning if you taste the things that melted at first, it will have a very intense flavour.\n\nThe same principle is at work when you suck on your popsicle, as your mouth is very warm and melts the ice inside of it very rapidly, and if you look at the structure of the ice under a microscope, you will find it is not a solid block, but has small little \"pores\" and is basically a network of crystals with air pockets inside them, so when you suck on your popsicle, you are sucking out any liquid that may be inside this small little network of crystals, and that liquid will likely be the flavouring, which tends to melt before the ice (and often also the colouring, making  it look like regular ice around the core of the popsicle)"},
{"title":"ELI5: Why do monks have shaved heads?","answer":"Tonsure is the practice of cutting or shaving some or all of the hair on the scalp, as a sign of religious devotion or humility.

Current usage more generally refers to cutting or shaving for monks, devotees, or mystics of any religion as a symbol of their renunciation of worldly fashion and esteem. Tonsure also refers to the secular practice of shaving all or part of the scalp to show support or sympathy, or to designate mourning."},

{"title":"ELI5: Ice expands when it freezes. If you keep cooling it, does it keep expanding? At what point does it begin to contract again?","answer":"Because the engineering toolbox table only has 10 degree increments you are only extrapolating between 0 and -10. The plots show the detail of what happens right around 0C which is more complicated.\n\nThe real answer is the water hits it's maximum density a little above 0, but only because the temperature is not uniform throughout the whole sample, so some areas are already freezing while other areas are still cooling as a liquid. So the overall density is going down, but locally, the areas which are liquid will still be going up in density. This provides a continuum towards the whole sample being frozen which is what the chart you linked shows. \n\nIf you were able to control the whole sample at uniform temperature then you might be able to see a true discontinuity in density, but in practice it just can't be done."},
{"title":"ELI5: Why are dominantly slashing weapons curved?

If you use the formula F=ma (mass times acceleration) you can can still generate same amount of force using a slower but heavier sword if compared to a lighter and faster one.  \n\nHaving said that, I'll go back to my initial post and repeat that one big advantage of a curved sword is that it does more damaged by concentrating all that force over smaller area as compared to a straight sword."},

{"title":"ELI5: How is Pascal's barrel even possible?","question_detail":"I recently read about it and I can't fathom it in my head. I know that it's part of physics. Basically what Pascal's barrel is, is that you put a long vertical tube inside a barrel filled with water, and as you pour water into the long tube it will shatter that wooden barrel. \n\nIs it because the pressure is going to the bottom of the barrel?\nIs it even possible to replicate it?","answer":"You have to bear in mid that the barrel is sealed.  So the pressure inside the barrel is governed by the hight of the tube. It is not affected by the diameter of the tube. A 10m tube has a pressure of about one atmosphere, about 15psi at it's base. Inserting the tube into the barrel increases the pressure in the whole barrel by an extra 15psi. This extra pressure is what causes the barrel to burst."},

In their pursuit of ratings, they realized that portraying politics as a battle between two side &amp; a proxy war between different cultures, rather than about actual policies and compromise drover viewer number up.  The catch is that by reporting things as adversarial, they've managed to make it so.\n\nThe right is now this frighteningly unified block of religious social belief and pro-business policies that will oppose anything coming from the other side of the aisle.  To keep their base motivated, they've forced religion and morality into every political discussion. They will use \"Liberal\" as a slur and equate it to being un-American, godless baby killers.\n\nThe left isn't much better.  While they're far less unified &amp; often seemingly ineffectual due to their inability to come to a consensus they're equally bad at unfairly criticising the other side.  It's pretty much standard to call them backwards, unsophisticated, uneducated, bible-thumping, money hungry morons.\n\nAbortion is a perfect example of the division between us.  The two sides there aren't even arguing about the same thing - we have the \"pro-life\" and \"pro-choice\" camps.  One side paints their opponents as baby killers while the other claims their opponents hate women.  Getting meaningful compromise is nearly impossible."},

When someone is unconscious they can't protect their airway so things like snoring and sleep apnea are quite dangerous. When someone's asleep and they stop breathing they will wake up a little bit so they can shift or contract muscles to let them breath again. Unconscious people can't do this so they can die. In surgery they will put a tracheal tube in to hold the airway open. In other cases it's common to roll the person onto their side since that helps keep the throat open."},

Is H2O ever really destroyed or totally consumed?","answer":"You are right, water is almost never actually destroyed, it just keeps circulating.

When he first got him as a pup, the owner made sure to tell him that the dog is extremely loyal to the owner and it's breed is essentially a hunting dog. The former owner said that it is in the dog's breed and all the offspring are the same. \n\nI dont know if he was mistaken or something. This is the only dog I've ever gotten close enough to be familiar with.\n\nFast forward to recently and I haven't seen the dog in years and it acts incredibly aggressive towards me and is generally unloving toward other members of my family other than my nephew, his true owner. Also I was told the dog is great at fetch and location, which I assume is in part to his breed.\n\nWhy does the breed of the dog have so much effect on it's temperament or characteristics? \n\nIs this common among all domesticated animals? If so, how long (if ever) will domestication do away with breed traits because I know that the dog was raised by pretty much their entire family but it really only loves it's owner.

It seems to me that whether you bid early, or bid late, or whatever, it all comes down to who is willing to spend the most on the item.   When people claim to be really good at auctions, is it purely a reflection of their wealth, or are the other patrons manipulable?

{"title":"ELI5: How is it that organizations like Norml haven't been able to fight the prohibition of Marijuana in the courts as unconstitutional with the lack of evidence that marijuana (aside from smoking it) is harmful?","question_detail":"It seems to me, that organizations with donors should have the legal muscle to at least get one judge to say that the prohibition of Marijuana (and let's say other harmless drugs) is a violation of our liberties.

Obama's administration has admitted in writing that the War on Drugs is \"ineffective,\" and numerous other studies and professionals can confirm this.  Shouldn't this be enough evidence to counter the exaggerated claims of the Feds?\n\nI'm hoping for someone has a little more legal understanding of the situation.  The questions on here that border on the same general idea seem to get answers along the lines of 'because money, because corporations, because politicians.'  When we're talking about the courts, those variables tend to have a lot less of an effect, especially when we're talking about many different judges in different states.\n\nEdit: I'm going to bed soon, please forgive me when I don't click the \"explained\" button for several hours.","answer":"I believe the relevant legislation comes under the Trade and Commerce power - the trade in marijuana is interstate commerce, which the Federal Government can pass laws to regulate, including banning the trade altogether."},

That was the root cause in USA, which then spread across the world. \n\nBecause credit dried up, people couldn't get loans or mortgages so consequently a lot of construction projects that were pencilled on got put on hold.

{"title":"ELI5: Recently science has been trying to run experiments on a theory claiming the universe is a hologram. What is the significance in that?","question_detail":"I'm not asking for anything crazy nor am I asking how they're going to prove it. I just can't figure out why this is important in the slightest.","answer":"Imagine a movie projector, and moving images (i.e., a movie) are being projected onto a movie screen.  If you paused the movie and zoomed into the image, you would see that image was made up of thousands of tiny little pixels.  If you zoom into the pixels very very close, the pixels would become blurry and fuzzy.  \n\nThe pixels are like the particles in our reality.  The experiment is to zoom into the particles very very close, and to see if the particles become blurry and fuzzy at very very close-up.  If our particles were real and solid, then they would not behave like pixels - real solid objects become clear, not blurry, when we look very close.   If our particles were holographic in nature, then they would become blurry like pixels when we look very very close.  That is the general idea.\n\nWe already know that the elementary building block of our reality - electrons, neutrons, protons, etc. - have dual existence: they are waves *and* particles.  They exist as waves all around us.  They pop out of the wave form and turn into particles - but only when we *consciously* observe them.  When we are not looking, they turn back into waves - as if they are aware if we are looking at them or not.\n\nIt is very difficult for us to conceptualize how that wave-particle duality could make sense *unless* you imagine our reality as something like a movie projection.  For the longest time, scientists knew particles behave as waves as well as particles depending on whether we are observing/measuring the particles or not, but scientists could not understand why particles would behave as such.  The Holographic principle is a good explanation and provides an excellent way for us to conceptualize the wave-particle duality.\n\nAgain, imagine a movie projector was rolling and projecting moving images.  The projection traveled the empty spaces between the projector and the movie screen - and it traveled *as waves*.  Before the projection reached and hit the movie screen, you could actually see the projection waves coming out from the projector lens.  The waves carry images.  Images (and pixels that made up the images) were embedded inside the waves.  \n\nWe are inside those waves.  We are parts of those waves.  Our entire universe - and everything in it - is made up of waves and only waves.  We do not actually exist in solid form.   We exist as waves and frequencies.  Our \"reality\" seems solid to us only because everything else also exists inside the waves with us.  When we observe objects (including ourselves) when we are inside the waves, the objects appear as constructs made of particles (i.e., pixels.)  That is how our reality is waves and particles at the same time.\n\nThat makes sense.  Now scientists are trying to further prove our reality is a holographic projection by looking for the \"blurriness\" in particles.  By the way, I use a simple 2D movie projector as an example, but holographic projection requires multiple cameras, and 3D projections are more complex.  However, the basic principles are the same.\n\nThe significances are many.  If we are just projection waves, then we are not really here.  We do not actually exist in this universe.  We are being projected from somewhere else, and we actually exist there.  Let's go back to the movie projector example: the projection is not the real existence.  The real existence is the film print inside the projector.   The film print is where the original information is stored in solid form.  That means our real selves actually exist on some two-dimensional \"film print\" somewhere else.  But where?  We do not know for sure, (although most scientists say black holes are the \"projectors\".)\n\nHow does physics work in that two-dimensional reality?  Is there a way for us to manipulate the physics in that reality through our reality?  Those and many more are all very interesting questions."},
{"title":"ELI5 what is going on in my brain when I think of a food and I can smell it inside of my head for a very brief second?","answer":"When you close your eyes, you can picture specific objects in your mind or play back \"movie clips\" of visual memories, all without using your eyes at all. You can also hear yourself reading this text right now, even though your ears are not collecting sound waves and sending them to your brain for identification and interpretation. Think of these as \"secondary\" sights and sounds, as opposed to the \"primary\" ones where your eyes and ears are taking in visual and audio data that your brain makes sense of on the fly all the time. Same goes for when you relive the smell of the ocean from your first trip to the beach. \n\nThe way your senses work is that your brain spends your entire lifetime building up libraries of images, sounds, smells, etc. that are constantly reorganized and refreshed with newer and more vital or relevant information that can be accessed instantly in order to make sense of your surroundings. If you were born blind, and your eyesight was restored, you wouldn't just all the sudden be able to see. In fact, it would take months or years to hone your newfound sense of sight into something that is actually useful to you. The reason is that you lack the enormous library of images that other people use to be able to \"see\". \n\nThe way your brain organizes stores memories of all types is by association. So, that first trip to the beach - which was likely a very memorable experience - has all sorts of other related memories interconnected with that lovely smell of salt water that you can \"smell\" inside your head so easily. Anytime you are near the ocean for the rest of your life, the smell of the salt water will always trigger memories of your first trip to the beach, and those memories will become more clear and plentiful than when you try to access them while sitting at your desk at work or even looking at photos from the trip or the shell that you still keep from it. Your sense of smell and the huge warehouse of olfactory data stored in your brain are responsible for more nostalgia than other sense memories.  "},

{"title":"ELI5: What materially changes between economic boom and bust globally or regionally: why can't we just decide things are still going great?","answer":"Economics is really complicated, and there are no hard and fast rules to it. It's a social science, after all.\n\nIf you believe in Keynesian economics, a recession is due to a slump in demand. \n\nIf you believe in classical economics, a recession is due to exogenous shocks to an economy, for example the doubling of oil prices.\n\nYou should read this book Naked Economics, it's great and really informative. Of course, that would make it ELI20&amp;aUndergraduateStudent, already.\n\nBut basically, what materially changes could be:\n\n- Consumers are spooked and not spending. Businesses experience a slump in sales, start laying off people. Unemployment goes up, people become more fearful, and the vicious cycle perpetuates. *This would be your Keynesian recession.*\n\n- Oil-exporting nations decide to cut their exports by 50%. With less oil, the productive capacity (theoretical maximum amount of production in a nation) decreases, because virtually everything in a modern society requires oil. So the economy HAS to shrink, because the amount of resources it has to work with has decreased, and unless there are wizards living among the people who can conjure resources out of nothingness, the amount of goods and services it can produce will decline as well. *This is your classical recession.*\n\n- Among many other possible factors.\n\nFor an economic boom, it's pretty much the same, just opposite. For example, everyone is happy and spending, businesses expand and hire more people, the Government invests in infrastructure (to keep nudging the productive capacity to expand), and you have your textbook sustainable growth.\n\nNot an economist, not an economics student (well, used to), just a dude who has been recently interested in economics and have been reading books."},

{"title":"ELI5: if an animal dies why can't the meat be eaten?","answer":"Animals that died of natural causes are more likely to have parasites or diseases, and even if they're clean they aren't going to be anywhere near as tasty as a healthy, strong animal slaughtered in the prime of its life.\n\nThere's also the matter of decomposition — microbes will begin to feast on dead flesh immediately unless measures are taken to prevent it. Even in the relatively sterile conditions of a slaughterhouse, preventing contamination is a constant battle. The kind of microbes that decompose carrion produce poisonous (or just disgusting) compounds to prevent their lunch from being eaten by other species. Carrion-eating animals have a higher tolerance to these compounds (for example, dogs are immune to the toxins produced by salmonella), but humans aren't one of these animals."},

{"title":"ELI5: How do plants get diseases and how do they fight the off?","answer":"Largely they get diseases the same way humans do. They get bit by a bug that had already visited another plant that was infected, or an airborne fungus or mold spore landed on them and found good conditions to grow, or they've been poisoned by too much or too little of something in their environment, or they're weakened by an open cut that allows pathogens to get inside.\n\nHow they fight them off depends on the species, but an important part of the process is that their circulatory system is quite different from ours so they don't really have \"antibodies\" that find their way to the invasion site and use their mobility to directly combat the infection. \n\nSometimes, like with humans, they simply can't fight it off and the whole plant dies. Sometimes they grow around the infected area and seal it off, something that often happens with trees that lose a limb or have a dead spot in their trunk. Sometimes they compensate by growing elsewhere or differently, like producing a second crop of leaves in years when infestations of 'army worm' caterpillars eat the tree bare in spring. And sometimes they start producing poisons in their tissues that drive the invader off. Oaks do this as the summer progresses, starting out with yummy tender leaves bursting from the buds in spring and ending up with pretty poisonous ones by late summer that caterpillars stay away from."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why if I am at a concert arena and someone speaks at the other side I can't hear them but if the arena was full I am able to hear chatter all around the room?","question_detail":"Just something that puzzled me","answer":"It's all acoustics related to how sound pressure is additive with multiple sounds sources.  Basically, sounds of the same frequency, from multiple generation sources , amplify the intensity of sound in that frequency.  In a huge crowd, there are a lot of different voices , so a lot of sound frequencies are adding together across the range of human hearing.\n\nIt is similar to how waves in the ocean get larger when they meet.

{"title":"ELI5: Why is salmonellosis caused by handling reptiles, less severe than salmonellosis caused by food poisoning?","question_detail":"Salmonella can be caught from pet turtles and other reptiles. When this happens, as shown by this site, http://www.anapsid.org/salm3.html and other sites, it doesn't seem THAT severe. They do get the usual stomach cramps, diarrhea, and fever, but reports make it seem that it's less severe than salmonella caused by contaminated food. And they don't always vomit, either. \n\nBUT, When you hear people talk about when they had food poisoning, they'll often use words such as \"I felt like death\" and \"I'd rather break all the bones in my body, then get raped, then ram a huge rusty sword into my stomach, then get shot with 100 machine guns than get it again\" (exaggeration intended). Basically it seems a lot more severe than reptile-induced salmonella, with all the ER visits, vomiting many times a day, and feeling far more torturous. Hell, the last time I had food poisoning (salmonella) was when I was 8, I puked 6 times and it was so traumatic I still have a fear of germs to this day. I'd call it OCD, but I've been been diagnosed.","answer":"There are over 100 different subtypes of Salmonella, and all 100 have different levels of virulence (that means how severe the disease they cause is).

{"title":"ELI5 why recording (free-to-air) TV is okay, as opposed to…","question_detail":"(NB: I live in Australia, so Australia-relevant information would be nice, but I'm also interested in an international view)\n\nWhy is recording (using a PVR, by pointing a video camera at the screen, etc.) a free-to-air television programme or film legal; but torrenting such a programme or film, sharing a recording with someone else, or recording or downloading such a programme from a (free) on-demand internet service such as ABC iView is prohibited?","answer":"Back when the VCR was originally invented, broadcasters and content producers went to court to ban VCRs with recording capabilities on the grounds that it facilitated illegal reproduction of copyrighted material. In the US, at least, courts ruled that making a personal recording for \"time-shifting\" purposes (record now, watch later) was legal. Unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material remained illegal.\n\nTorrenting is illegal because it's unauthorized distribution. Also, it's particularly harmful to broadcasters and content producers because torrented shows almost always cut out advertisements, which is how free programming is funded.\n\nI don't know anything about iView or whether or why it's illegal to copy from it. In the US, capturing a video stream explicitly designed not to be captured would probably fall afoul of the anti-circumvention provision of the DMCA. That is, it's illegal to try to circumvent copy protection on copyrighted material."},

{"title":"ELI5:The Master Theorem for algorithm analysis and how to use it.","answer":"Suppose we have a recursive function. Specifically, it splits the data into *b* parts, recurses on *a* of them, and does some other operation each time proportional to *n^d*. Mathematically, that's T(n)=aT(n/b)+f(n), where f(n) is O(n^d ).\n\nThe function's asymptotic behavior depends on which half of that grows more quickly: The recursive part or the nonrecursive part. The nonrecursive part is easy. We defined it to be O(n^d ). The recursive part, it can be proven, is O(n^(log_b(a))). And indeed, that's the behavior of it if the nonrecursive part is constant, O(1).\n\nIf those numbers are different, then you just pick the faster growing half. But if they grow at the same rate, the recursion is actually O(n^d **log n*). Also if they're equal, you can change f(n) to be O(n^d * log^c n), and the recursion will be O(n^d * log^(c+1) n)."},

{"title":"ELI5: How do drugs get you high?","question_detail":"Like weed or coke","answer":"Let me try to break it down more in-depth than the previous posters. Our brains work in the first place by having sort of a lock and key system when it comes to how our neurons interact.   \n\nCheck [this out.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Neuron_Hand-tuned.svg) The labels are gone for some reason, but all the way on the left are the dendrites, and all the way on the left are the axon terminals. The terminals release certain chemicals called neurotransmitters than specifically fit into certain receptors in the dendrites on the next neuron. Normally, the neurotransmitters will attach to the receptors, send the signals down the cell, and repeat the process throughout many neurons. This is the process that makes us. Everything about us is dictated by this process, but different neurotransmitters do different things. Excess neurotransmitters are reabsorbed into the axon terminal.  \n\nDrugs work by one of two methods, and fortunately the drugs you provided cover both methods. Weed: weed mimics a neurotransmitter we already have in our body (anandamide). So it fits into those particular receptors, and stimulates the cells far more than normal. The faculties these cells are responsible for is amplified, and thus we get high. Other drugs, such as ketamine, will also fit into naturally occurring receptors, but instead they will block function rather than stimulate it. This is referred to as antagonism. Activation is agonism.  \n\nCocaine: Cocaine doesn't really bind to any receptor and activate it in the same way, but it does force a bigger release of neurotransmitters than normal, *and* blocks the reuptake system. This also forces the receptors to be overstimulated and also makes us high.   \n\n"},

","answer":"It's not necessarily what the author was \"aiming at\".\n\nSometimes it is, but these are usually relatively obvious metaphors and subtext. In these cases the author has included them specifically for this purpose.\n\nThe next level is what the audience actually takes away. This will usually be as the author intends, but it doesn't have to be. In some stories people find it easy to sympathise with the antagonist, wether or not it was actually intended.\n\nBeyond there you still have a lot of room to read into the work. Usually this is done by supposing that an aspect of the story is a metaphor or contributes to an additional theme, which becomes a valid interpretation if nothing else in the story contradicts it. This interpretation can then be used to compare to works interpreted in s similar or contrasting way.\n\nThe key is not trying to figure out what the author was trying to express in a particular, but to try and figure out what their work did (or can) express."},
{"title":"ELI5: Slot machine payout percentages","question_detail":"When I lived in Nevada, I had a friend who claimed that he always won the jackpot at slot machines by just having enough patience to play until the payout percentage worked in his favor. In his understanding of payout percentages, if you sat at a machine that advertised a $1,000 jackpot with an 87% payout percentage, all you had to do was sit at that machine and keep putting in money, and at some point between $1 and $870, the thing was going to eventually pay out the full jackpot. He maintained that this always worked for him, unless the casino was cheating the system and programming the machines against the legal payouts. \n\nNow, I'm smart in many ways but pretty dumb when it comes to mathematics. In my heart I know that slot machines can't be that simple to beat, but his logic was so simple that it actually sounded true. Most people in casinos simply don't have the balls, patience or the bankroll to sit at a machine and drop more than a few hundred dollars in the hopes of getting a few hundred in profit on the back end. \n\nSo someone clear this up for me once and for all.

{"title":"ELI5: Can an AB+ woman give birth to O blood type child?","question_detail":"I've read around and I'm too dumb to understand all this ABO stuff people are throwing around. Talking about 'dominant allelles' and such. If a mother has AB+, can their child have an O blood type? If so, in what situation?","answer":"Cis-AB refers to a rare genetic type (mutation) where both an \"A\" and a \"B\" gene are found on the same chromosome (segment of DNA that is passed down and found in analogous pairs, one from the father and one from the mother.) Therefore a Cis-AB person would technically have 3 genes for a blood type, such as [A&amp;B] and [O]. In this case it WOULD be possible to have an O child, if they have one chromosome with an O gene, and one with an [A&amp;B] gene. Hope that made sense. Basically both parents must have at least one \"O\" gene or allele on one of their chromosomes.  so AO + BO = possible, but AA + BO = not possible, for example."},

","answer":"Well sure, everyone complains they don't make enough. From McDonald's to engineers, everyone feels like they deserve a higher pay. The thing that's different here is that most industries don't have millions (maybe billions) of dollars spent ~~brainwashing~~ convincing the public that their workers need more money.\n\nBtw, I think pirating for the sake of greed is silly. If you enjoy the work someone does, you should compensate them appropriately. "},
{"title":"ELI5 How do radar speed guns (like the ones used by police) work?","question_detail":".","answer":"if the car is coming towards you, it's closing the gap between successive wavefronts, thus the waves bouncing off it will be perceived to have decreased wavelength/increased frequency, the opposite applies for a car moving away from you, this is the Doppler Effect.\n\nthe equation for the observed frequency, assuming you're standing still, is   \n\n - apparent frequency = ('actual' frequency x c) / ( c +- v)\n\n- (where c is the speed of the signal, and v is the velocity of the car relative to you, + if coming towards you, - if getting further away)\n\nso when the speed gun reads the apparent frequency of the waves bouncing off the moving object, it equates it to the right-hand side of this equation.

{"title":"ELI5: What happens if one person presses charges against another, and they're both found guilty?","question_detail":"Let me know if there's a better place to ask this, but I've always wondered what would happen if both people were equally at fault. For example, say Bob has a vehicle parked illegally sticking out into the driving lane. Then Joe, who is going 15 over the speed limit, runs into the vehicle. They both broke the law, and the collision could have been avoided if either one of them didn't. Would they both face punishment?","answer":"All sorts of misconceptions in this question.  First, nobody really \"presses charges,\" the police/prosecutors decide whether to indict and prosecute a person for a crime.  The only reason this is a concept in media is because for certain crimes the police/prosecutors will not even attempt to prosecute the case if the victim is uncooperative because the victim's testimony is the best, or in some cases the only, evidence and proving the case without that testimony would be impossible.\n\nNow, addressing your example.  Both would be cited and you're right both could have avoided the accident.  What happens in terms of criminal trials would be one is cited for parking illegally and the other is cited for careless driving or some other analog to that.  A civil lawsuit, on the other hand, would depend on the jurisdiction, but most likely would include concepts like the \"last clear chance\" doctrine and/or comparative/contributory negligence concepts in order to assign who was at more fault and would pay more money to the other."},

By dooming us again then \nprocess starts over? or ?","answer":"The first forms of life were asexual, there was no 'male' or 'female', and they didn't need a partner to reproduce. Unfortunately this means you're genetically identical to all of your children, so if something out there can kill you it will certainly kill them too.\n\nOver time eventually species evolved which were able to reproduce with a partner. This is beneficial due to the increased genetic diversity in the offspring.\n\nMore time passing evolves the process further and we start to get male and female pairs. This is beneficial because it means your partner can't possibly be genetically identical to you, and means the offspring is more likely to be genetically different to either one of the parents.\n\nA species may have developed sexual reproduction and was then wiped out, it's very possible.

What I cant wrap my head around is how exactly it is detrimental to the person being trolled. Unless of course it was a position SO ridiculous that it could only be held by a loon.\n\nexample of a troll/Devils advocate statement: I believe black people have something inherent in them that makes them prone to crime.\n\nThis statement I think is NOT foolish to comment on seeing as whether or not the person who wrote it personally holds this view, is still reasonable enough for me to know this is an opinion held by some people today.\n\nexample of, imo, real troll comment: I like to have sex with my daughter. Idk why though, gets its better than with my mom.\n\nThis comment has a tint of absurdity to it and is obviously baiting in it's execution that if anyone replies to it, I think, is giving themselves up to be called a fool because the original comment is not noteworthy enough.\n\nAnyway, thats how I think trolling works and people keep tossing the word around that I think its lost its meaning.","answer":"No doubt.\n\nBut keep in mind that a Devil's advocate doesn't hold a belief.

'Semantic arguments' get a bad wrap, because I believe that, at least on the surface, the require the least amount of work to do; they serve then as an obvious place to invest the least amount of effort. \n\nThat being said, I don't feel that semantic arguments are without their purpose. One my of my thoughts has often been that breaking the colloquial patterns in language, using a word that lies out of convention (partner vs wife), invokes a different line of thinking in those who hear it used. If you can prime a certain subset of ideas by simply changing a word, I would argue that at least warrants some consideration.  \n\nThanks for hashing this through with me by the way, it has been a long time since I've had a conversation like this with anybody.

It reads, in full, \n\n&gt; (1) Parliament or the legislature of a province may expressly declare in an Act of Parliament or of the legislature, as the case may be, that the Act or a provision thereof shall operate notwithstanding a provision included in section 2 or sections 7 to 15.\n\n\n&gt;  (2) An Act or a provision of an Act in respect of which a declaration made under this section is in effect shall have such operation as it would have but for the provision of this Charter referred to in the declaration.\n\n\n&gt;  (3) A declaration made under subsection (1) shall cease to have effect five years after it comes into force or on such earlier date as may be specified in the declaration.\n\n\n&gt;  (4) Parliament or the legislature of a province may re-enact a declaration made under subsection (1).\n\n\n&gt;  (5) Subsection (3) applies in respect of a re-enactment made under subsection (4).\n\nBasically what it means is that a province (or Parliament) can pass legislation that they know violates one of the aforementioned sections of the charter, and that the legislation will remain in force and effect for a limited time period, and cannot be subjected to a judicial review.

With recent changes in rules per the golden rule people are now allowed to throw limitless amounts of money at things. That alienates the populace. The US is becoming an oligarchy in the guise of a republic, and that is a problem in and of itself.\n\nThere is also the fear of another recession or depression as a result of the inequality.

{"title":"ELI5: What does it actually mean when the star of a tv show is credited as an executive producer?","question_detail":"Do they actually  do anything? Or is it just a way of paying them more?","answer":"As you say, the credit means they have more power over the production, even if they're not ironing out the day-to-day production details.\n\nFor instance, most stars would be banned from doing their own stunts in case they are injured and it delays filming, or causes the film to be cancelled entirely. You're not going to let someone put the entire project at risk just to satisfy their ego.\n\nHowever, Tom Cruise is a case in point here - he does most of his own stunts, and some spectacular ones that the front man would *never* normally be allowed to do. He can swing this on certain films because he has an EP credit which gives him the clout to insist on doing it his way, and has backed the production with enough of his own money to cover the costs if he gets hurt and the project stalls just because he wanted to play the hero.\n\nHe's effectively underwriting the additional risk he is introducing to the production schedule."},

If the average time required to lure a Great White to a cage is three days (not an uncommon waiting period), the shark may have traveled from a distance as great as 144 miles (232 kilometres). This is farther than has ever been demonstrated — or suggested — to be within any shark's scent-tracking ability. However, field experiments suggest that hearing may be a shark's longest-range sense, some species apparently able to hear artificially produced sounds at least several miles (kilometres) away from their source."},
{"title":"ELI5:What is happening in my mouth (or in my brain) when I eat something I don't like ?","question_detail":"In other words, what is the physical or chemical phenomenon behind the fact I dislike some types of food and like some others ? What is causing me to hate some types of food to the point it can literally makes me throw up ?","answer":"If you literally feel like throwing up, it may be a [taste aversion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste_aversion). These normally develop when you eat something, and then get sick soon afterwards (nausea or vomiting). Even if the food you ate had nothing to do with the sickness, you can develop a lifelong aversion or hatred of that taste, to the point where even just the thought of it can make you feel ill. This is an evolutionary adaptation that prevents us from eating things that have possibly made us sick in the past.\n\nAs for general likes and dislikes of food, there is likely a genetic component in how you decide what foods are good or bad to eat, and you are also influenced by various experiences you had with food throughout your life (positive or negative associations you have formed, or badly-prepared dishes that made you want to avoid that type of food in the future). I'm not sure we really have an understanding of how exactly this works in the brain.\n\nThere are specific genetic mutations that may also affect your taste in food, such as the one that makes cilantro [taste like soap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriander#Taste_and_smell) to some people."},

{"title":"ELI5: How does screen protectors work? And why did apple switch from gorilla glass 2 to sapphire glass?","answer":"A screen protector adds a extra layer protection due to the material its made of. The plastic is more pliable than hard while the screen is usually harder and not as pliable. This allows something abrasive (like sand for example) to be pressed against it and not scratch it since the protector will deform around the sand keeping it off the screen. The protector then snaps back into shape.\n\nNote: Protectors do protect from other things beside abrasion."},

What caused this? And how did improvements to modern TV sets ultimately render this a non-issue.","answer":"A vertical sync signal zeros the vertical oscillator.  Rolling happens when the TV is not sensitive to a standard sync signal, or the station is providing a weak one.\n\n\"Modern\" analog TVs had few sync issues, because broadcasts were more stringent, the stations generate clean sync locally, and the TVs digitally operated the raster scan system.\n\nModern TV does not even have a video sync signal, just frames, which the frame decode directly controls the display."},

{"title":"ELI5:Why have gas prices plummeted in the past weeks?","answer":"Oil is sold in a market that permits derivative contracts.  In other words, I can make a deal with you to buy oil from you in 90 days (or a year, or multiple years, etc.) at a price we negotiate today which is fixed regardless of the market price of oil on the day the contract is completed.\n\nThis tends to damp out daily rises and falls in the price of oil, keeping it on a fairly narrow trajectory.  Under normal circumstances, the result is that the price of oil doesn't move a lot in short periods of time.\n\nThese are not normal circumstances.  Over the past year, a bunch of things have happened that have changed the calculus of what a barrel of oil costs.  Since these forces became evident people have been less willing to do derivative deals for oil, or have written those contracts in ways that allow them to capture the upside of lower prices on the delivery date, or are offset (\"hedged\") in various other ways.\n\nThe current market is seeing a rapid adjustment to a much lower price due to the end of a window of pre-existing derivatives.\n\nThe market changed due to three major factors:\n\n1:  The United States has begun fracking at massive scale, pouring oil into the US domestic market, which has the effect of changing the worldwide supply of oil for all other markets.  As supply goes up, price goes down.\n\n2:  Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan are producing more and more oil each day.  These are supplies were limited during the years of the Saddam Hussein regime and after the Iraq war it took time to get the oilfields back into production.  The Kurds have also begun to ship oil against the wishes of the central government but the are doing it anyway.  Again, more supply means lower demand.\n\n3:  Mexico voted this year to relax its limits on foreign investment in its oil industry.  PEMEX, the national oil company, has a lot of very old, very poorly operated infrastructure.  The market assumes that new money and new technology will rapidly increase the amount of oil that Mexico will produce in the short term.  This increase is factored in to what people expect to pay for oil next year.\n\nOPEC, the cartel that represents about 1/3rd of world oil production, could reduce its production to restrict supply and increase prices.  So far, they have not been able to do so.  Saudi Arabia, in particular, refuses to reduce production.  If they do not reduce production, the rest of OPEC won't either.  Saudi Arabia assumes that it's OPEC partners would cheat on any production limitation deal (they have in the past, and currently they're already overproducing their current cap and have been for years).  As long as Saudi Arabia thinks OPEC can't really enforce an across-the-board cut, it will not cut production either.  If OPEC doesn't cut production, the current level of supply will keep prices at their current low rates for the foreseeable future."},

Why?  It is especially frustrating when they are in left turn lane and take up most of that lane - preventing cars from getting into the turn lane - and then take so long to get through the green turn light that you miss the signal. \n\nEdit:  I am talking about a abnormally large cushion between cars. Conservatively a good driver would leave space between cars to avoid colliding with it if rear-ended or if the driver in front should roll back.  This is on flat ground and the space is unnecessarily large.  When the left turn lane is full it blocks traffic in the other lanes because people are waiting in the regular lane to get into the turn lane.  Plus, people who do this create additional unnecessary time which prevents long lines of traffic from getting through the green light before it changes to red.","answer":"I leave at least a car length mostly for added flexibility if things go wrong.

{"title":"ELI5: Why can the densities of supermassive black holes be less than that of water on earth and what does it mean?","question_detail":"I understand that that the mathematics predict that the density is inversely proportional to the radius of the black hole itself \n\n**copied from wikipedia**\n\n*First, the average density of a supermassive black hole (defined as the mass of the black hole divided by the volume within its Schwarzschild radius) can be less than the density of water in the case of some supermassive black holes.[5] This is because the Schwarzschild radius is directly proportional to mass, while density is inversely proportional to the volume. Since the volume of a spherical object (such as the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole) is directly proportional to the cube of the radius, the density of a black hole is inversely proportional to the square of the mass, and thus higher mass black holes have lower average density. In addition, the tidal forces in the vicinity of the event horizon are significantly weaker for massive black holes. As with density, the tidal force on a body at the event horizon is inversely proportional to the square of the mass: a person on the surface of the Earth and one at the event horizon of a 10 million solar mass black hole experience about the same tidal force between their head and feet. Unlike with stellar mass black holes, one would not experience significant tidal force until very deep into the black hole.*\n\nBut I do not understand from a physical perspective why the internal gravity doesn't compress the matter more.

For example the acute phase of Hepatitis B lasts 6 months, and if in this time the body immune system does not clear the virus, the patient gets into a chronic phase.\n\nMy question is how can you tell the disease went from acute to chronic phase? Why 6 months? Why can't the immune system clears the virus after the acute phase?","answer":"Not all diseases have an acute and chronic phase. Most illness are either acute or chronic. Acute (sudden) phase is rapid onset with severe, uncontrollable symptoms. Chronic (long term) is longer, usually less severe (but not any less dangerous!), and signs and symptoms are usually controlled. An illness becomes chronic if it is not dealt with within 3-6 months (depending on illness). I don't know why this is the agreed upon time limit, but that's generally the consensus. With your example of Hepatitis B you can tell the patient is in the acute phase because they will usually have severe fatigue, pain in the epigastic/umbilical/lumbar regions, nausea, vomiting. Once in the chronic phase the patient will lose all of these symptoms with the exception of the pain which will be less severe. The liver will slowly become cirrhosed leading to a build up of toxins (most noticeably bilirubin which is what causes the skin to turn yellow). A patient with chronic Hep B may also be completely asymptomatic.\n\n\n\nSo to answer your original question the differences between acute and chronic are:\n\n\n1: Time frame,\n\n\n2: Signs and symptoms,\n\n\n3: Severity of symptoms,\n\n\n4: Patient understanding and education.\n\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: why does gravity affect the flow of time (gravitational time dilation)","question_detail":"I'm sure we've all heard that time slows down as you approach the speed of light. I've heard the following simple explanation as to **why** this occurs (I believe it was described this way by Michio Kaku), and it makes sense to me:\n\nBasically, the speed of light is the \"universal speed limit\". Nothing can go faster than the speed of light. But what if you were on a spaceship going just barely under the speed of light, say maybe 4 MPH slower? Suppose you started running from the back of this ship to the front? Well, if time didn't slow down as you approach the speed of light, then if you reached a full run on this ship, your speed combined with the speed of the craft could easily exceed the speed of light! But, because time slows down as you get close to the speed of light, no matter how fast you run, you'll never quite reach the speed of light.\n\nThe other explanation I've heard is that we move not only through space, but through time as well - and that speed is constant. As we move faster through space, some of that speed is taken from how fast we are moving through time. This makes sense to me as well.\n\nSo now what I am looking for is a similarly simple explanation as to how gravity factors into this whole thing. Why does gravity affect how fast time passes for you? Assuming you're on the surface of a planet, gravity isn't making you move anywhere. But we know that time passes (ever so slightly) slower on the surface of earth than it does for say, our satellites. Why?","answer":"Think of a stick rotating around its center, its outer parts move faster through space (and thus time) than its inner part, otherwise the stick shatters and is no more. It's a bit the same thing with gravity, a never ending spinning fall in the gravity well if you will (which itself might be falling forever into another well, and another). At any given point along the axis of this \"scale dimension\", time needs to flow faster on the outer side than on the inner side to maintain the integrity of this beautiful ballet of falling and spinning gravity wells that is the universe.

{"title":"ELI5:what is post nasal drip and why is it so difficult to get rid of?","question_detail":"i get colds frequently because i work with children and frequently they end with a month, or more in the worst cases, of post nasal drip that causes me to cough a ton and have sore throats. could someone explain the process, why it happens, how to treat it, ect?","answer":"I get the same thing regularly. \n\nYour nose and throat are connected by your sinus. Your sinus is where boogers come from. Usually, they come out of your nose, but sometimes (especially in winter when the dry air turns your boogers hard in your nose but they stay wet inside your sinus/throat, or when your sinuses are inflamed/infected and boogers can't escape), they drip backwards instead of forwards. Instead of a runny nose, you get a post nasal drip. Instead of blowing your nose, you cough it up. Coughing leads to the sore throat.\n\nThere's not much you can do to prevent it beyond the normal steps (flu shots, hand washing, etc). If it's recurring, there is a good chance you're prone to sinus infections (sinusitis).

{"title":"ELI5: How do smart phone \"View\" cases work?","question_detail":"When i say veiw case i mean something like [this](http://www.galaxys4flipcase.com/media/aw_islider/Battery%20Flip%20Case%20for%20Galaxy%20S4.jpg). I have one and i like it (A \"no longer available\" incipo view case for the galaxy mega, view screen and a few card folds/slots), and i was just checking reddit on my phone when i just randomly folded it weird. basically think like a closed book or the actual case. now take the left side and fold it under the left side of the phone, as in the back, but the front flap is still pointed up to where i would see the inside where the card slots are. for some reason the case and phone reacted, when they touched, and it went into the \"view screen\" mode and i was basically \"locked out\" of doing anything if it was held like that. noit only that but how is it a phone knows to go to \"view scree\" mode when either closed or, i guess when that point touches, without some form of software download or something. thanks in advance for any answers","answer":"With a small magnet which tells the phone that the case is closed (this is how it works at Apple devices)"},

Someone who is otherwise normal but is also deaf might fall in here.  Someone who is cognitively fine but blind, or paralyzed or whatever.

For example, there is a subset of the population where some women are actually attracted to guys with tons of stuff, but the rest of us recognize this as primitive.

I'll deal with them.\n\nThere are two fluids in the brain which collectively form 'happiness'. These are Dopamine, the feeling of confidence and self-love that comes from achievement, and Seratonin, the feeling of joy at contact with others or with desirable physical feelings.\n\nSSRIs make it so that when your brain 'uses' some Seratonin on something it gets recycled into fresh Seratonin instead of breaking down. It prevents the 'lows' that you sometimes feel after a rush.\n\nIf you have self-esteem issues, you might be prescribed a medication which augments dopamine. Such medications are the most addictive medications on earth, though, and people are prone to taking too much. They're quite risky if not done properly.\n\nTrust the doctors. If you are concerned about your doctor's diagnosis or prescription, see two more doctors and go with what the majority think.

{"title":"ELI5: Humans need multiple types of sources of food for their nutrition, vegetables, meat and so on.How do carnivores get all their nutrition just from meat?","answer":"Different species are able to synthesize different nutrients themselves through cellular processes. Nutrients include carbohydrates, fats, proteins (or their building blocks, amino acids), and vitamins. This means instead of the body having to \"eat\" the protein containing a particular amino acid, the cell itself can make that amnio acid. This of course requires energy and work by the cell. Conversely, \"a nutrient is said to be \"essential\" if it must be obtained from an external source, either because the organism cannot synthesize it or produces insufficient quantities\". So there are two kinds of nutrients, those that we can make through our own cellular processes, and those we must obtain through our diet. \n\n[Proteins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein) are made up of different [amnio acids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid). A good analogy is that a protein is like a train, and the individual cars are amnio-acids. Different combinations of cars, in different orders give different trains. In the same way, different amnio-acids, in different combinations give different kinds of proteins. Digestion, be it in animals or humans, results in the breakdown proteins into their amnio acid components. The intestine absorbs the individual amnio acids and the body ships these amnio acids to the cells. Cellular processes rearrange the amnio acids in new ways to make new proteins that are used by the animal or human for various bodily functions. So think of the cell as the railyard where new trains (proteins) are made but reassembling the cars (amnio-acids) into new and different combinations. \"Proteins perform a vast array of functions within living organisms, including catalyzing metabolic reactions, replicating DNA, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules from one location to another.\" \n\nThere are [nine essential amino acids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_amino_acid) that humans must consume in their diet because our cells cannot make them through cellular processes. The rest we can make ourselves in our cells. This means that our diet must meet these minimum essential amnio acids requirements in order for us to survive. We cannot make the nine, we must consume the nine. The nine are found in all kinds of foods, from plants to meat which is why humans can have such a wide variety of diets (e.g. vegetarian, vegan, allergen-accomidating) and still function normally.\n\nHowever, other animals have different essential nutritional requirements. For example, [cats, unlike humans, cannot synthesize the amino acid taurine so it must be added to their diet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurine#In_animal_nutrition). Some species are able to synthesize Vitamin C and do not need to consume it in their diet (e.g. mice), whereas humans cannot synthesize Vitamin C and thus are required to consume it in our diet. These differences in essential nutrient intake creates different dietary requirements for different species and results in different types of foods being consumed preferentially by different species. This is why a lion is able to survive and thrive just on meat material, whereas we are required to consume a more varied diet. They obtain all their unique essential nutrients from their carnivore diet.\n\nSo other species have different combinations of essential nutrients in order to sustain a balanced and healthy diet. This makes perfect sense, if all species had the exact same requirements there would be a lot of competition for the same food resources. By diversifying what is essential to consume, there is less competition. Remember that it is costly for the body to produce its own nutrients through cellular processes. It is much easier to just consume an amnio acid than produce it. Thus, if a particular amino acid or nutrient is abundant and easily available in a species environment it makes more sense for natural selection to select against the cell's producing that nutrient, and for the individual to simply consume it. For example, most primates - including humans - do not synthesize vitamin C. This makes perfect sense since vitamin C is easily acquired through our collective diets by consuming fruit. Fruit is abundant resource in most primate's environments thus vitamin C would not be hard to acquire. So each species is balancing what they need to eat, and what they can produce themselves, along with what is available to them in their environment."},

Every culture looks at time differently, there is a tribe in Africa( i believe dont remember where i heard this) that does not have any words for yesterday or tomorrow, they literally only live in the present.  So to explain time to them would be very difficult because their is no words to translate them to.

(slightly different).\n\nI'm actually a chemist, so it's funny you mention that. It isn't so much that pouring the water causes the splashing, it's that hydrating can release some heat. This heat can actually reach high enough temperatures to cause the water to bubble and thus spray acid around. \n\nNow... realistically? This is the case for strong acids (like sulfuric acid), however, I've seen water poured into concentrated sulfuric and not really cause too much of an issue. \n\nIt's really just a better safe than sorry thing.

When you commit traffic violations you are committing a crime, you are a dangerous and bad driver and by pulling you over and giving you a ticket, or arresting you if the violation was severe enough they are protecting the rest of the drivers on the road from your bad behavior.

{"title":"ELI5:Can someone explain to me as to why Greece continue to grow into further debt?","answer":"Another big factor is that Greece is on the Euro which is a much stronger currency than the Greek economy should have and they have no real say in how that currency is managed.

{"title":"ELI5: What is Scientology and why do they seem to be so powerful in America?","question_detail":"Scientology is something that I've only read about here on reddit. About how they have 'too many seats in the Congress'  or 'a bunch of actors are that'. And I get is some type of religion (?) although this sounds too similar to the theories of 'The Jews control everything!' and the lizard people stuff so I have my doubts, but reddit seems to be sure about this. Is this a 'real'  thing? How did it start? Why a religion out of nowhere got so powerful then?","answer":"In the 1950s, L Ron Hubbard, a pulp SF writer (and actually a pretty fair one), and possibly the most prolific bullshitter of the 20th century, decided he could do much better for himself if he started a religion.\n\nFirst, he wrote \"Dianetics,\" kind of a pop psychology book that said the reason you're so screwed up is because of \"engrams,\" which are sort of dark spots on your psyche caused when your mother told you you were a worthless little shit when you were two. By going through \"auditing,\" a pseudo-psychoanalysis process, you could get rid of these engrams, and become \"clear,\" which would endow you with all kinds of marvelous mind powers. The west was going through a big pop psychology fad at the time, and Dianetics caught on like gangbusters.\n\nSoon afterwards, he expanded that to Scientology a full-on religion with reincarnation, a four-QUADRILLION-year-old universe, an alien overlord named Xenu, and all kinds of other goofy shit. In Scientology, once you're clear, then you progress up a series of \"Operating Thetan\" (OT) levels, each of which grants you more and more superpowers. It costs you more and more money to progress up the OT levels. They applied for status as a religion, and were granted it, which means they didn't have to pay taxes (among other things).\n\nHubbard managed to turn Scientology into a scam worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Almost everybody in Scientology, even the higher-ups (what they call the \"Sea Org,\" kind of like their clergy) bought into the bullshit. Even Hubbard seems to have bought into a bit of it.\n\nBut L Ron was one sick puppy, and had serious psychological issues that somehow, Scientology didn't fix. He was *seriously* paranoid, and ran Scientology like a fascist government (complete with its own prison, called the RPF). He had a crew of pre-teen girls called The Messengers, dressed in halter tops and hot pants, who did his bidding, everything from lighting his cigarettes to enforcing his will. When Hubbard was pissed at somebody (which happened *a lot*), but didn't want to go yell at them in person, he would dictate a rant to a messenger, who would then deliver it *precisely* as Hubbard had screamed it, every inflection, every curse. The Sea Org members were *terrified* of these little girls.\n\nLater on, Hubbard launched the largest infiltration of the US government in history. He sent out hundreds of Scientologists to take menial jobs like janitor or secretary in a government office, and then spend their time tapping phones, stealing documents, that kinda thing. When the feds finally nailed them, Hubbard escaped jail by throwing his wife under the bus.\n\nEventually, he \"passed into immortality,\" as the Scientologists say, and control of the enterprise was seized by David Miscavage, a genuinely enigmatic figure who appears to be at least as disturbed as Hubbard.\n\nToday, they're worth billions, they actively court big-name celebrities like Tom Cruise and John Travolta, and they continue to operate like a fascist organization, sending out goons to blackmail, harass, and destroy the lives of anyone who criticizes them. David Miscavage's wife (who used to be the Goebbels to his Hitler) has not been seen in public since about 2007, and people think she's being held in Scientology jail. The government can't touch them because they're a religion.\n\nThe IRS actually had a chance in the 90s to put them out of business (revolving around the legality of their religious status), but the Scientologists had been harassing the agency and its people for so long that they caved, and essentially carved their religious status in stone. Yes, you read that right: the Scientologists *harassed the IRS into giving up.*"},

Love is all those emotions except amplified, and towards a person. You love everything about them even their smell. Suddenly things that annoy you about other people, in them is realized as something lovely. You want to protect them, treat them, make them happy. With romantic love there is also usually lust. They are beautiful, arousing, sensual. You want to touch them, be with them, and you'll suffer uncomfortable sleeping positions and change your behaviors to make that happen."},

What if Cable tv had the bright idea to do away with cable boxes and just use a stick as the cable box to stream all the content?  This would effectively drive up the data consumption which I understand would likely become a public utility meaning we would pay per gigabyte used.\n\nDirectv and Dish might keep them honest for a while but both companies are on the market to be sold.","answer":"It works that way for water and electricity because it's the easiest way to charge fairly.  Landline phone service and internet service are different.  \n\nFor landline phone service, there are agreements in place among providers (domestically) which keeps costs low.  The infrastructure has long been paid for and maintenance is cheap.  So it wouldn't make sense to charge per minute.  It doesn't cost them more for you to talk another hour because almost all costs are fixed.\n\nFor non-mobile internet service, the maintenance costs are also extremely low.  It doesn't cost them more for you to use another gigabyte of data.  Their infrastructure only needs to be upgraded when more people switch to their service in the area or if they choose to guarantee higher speeds.    \n\nCable internet only costs companies about $1/month per subscriber, and they currently charge $40-$100/month.  That is a massive profit margin.  If everyone used twice as much data next month, the additional cost would be pennies.\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: Why is having an accent considered low class?","answer":"TL;DR: Everyone has an accent. Those who are in power, and have higher class, are the ones who define what is \"standard\" and what deviates from \"correct.\" \n\nLanguage is constantly evolving, by its nature. Therefore, people who are isolated from each other will over time develop a common language differently. This causes regional accents, that can break up into different dialects and then eventually languages. It also causes differences in language based on groups that are isolated socially even when they're in close geographical areas. It can happen along class lines as well as race and even age. Based on a group's unique experience new words can be introduced that outsiders don't understand (think internet abbreviations, or professional jargon). \n\nBack in olden times, like before the printing press was invented, local dialects weren't a big deal cause everyone could understand anyone they were likely to come in contact with. But when widespread text became a thing, language had to be standardized. It's not difficult to imagine what types of people were in charge of that standardization. The language that came most naturally to the rich and powerful became standard. Now instead of different dialects, there were institutionalized rules about \"correct\" and \"incorrect\" language, from vocabulary to grammar to pronunciation. \n\nSo in order to maintain this standardized language, we developed a culture that is focused on controlling language's propensity to change a lot by defaulting to the \"standard\" which is continually maintained by a predictable segment of society. The standard does change, because this is inevitable. But the standard remains the standard. It’s gotten to the point where speaking “correctly” is even considered to be a moral good, and you are looked down on if it doesn’t come naturally to you. It’s another way we unknowingly perpetuate inequality – we force people who didn’t grow up speaking the standard to either learn to mimic the standard accent/vocabulary/grammar, or be judged by society.\n\nEdit: a word\n"},

Isn't it possible to have a lightweight pressurized and heated suit for rescue crews?","answer":"I don't see the point of the pressure suit. An oxygen tank supplies oxygen, too.\n\nIt is hard to climb even for experienced climbers. Rapidly changing weather is one reason, another is accidents due to amateurs, overeager tour guides or bad luck. the lack of oxygen can make people more prone to make mistakes, too.\n\nPressure suit or not, you still need to bring oxygen tanks. those things are heavy and bulky. that is why they are not used all the time, but mostly at the higher altitudes.\n\nAs for a heated suit, anyone living in the colder parts of the world can confirm that it is overkill for anything below the ISS.  \nWith proper clothing, retaining your body heat is easy, and doesn't require any kind of heating unit."},

It pushes the object to see if the object is alive and is going to run.   If it just falls off, then it's useless.   If the object is a mouse that the cat did not recognize?  Time to hunt something!\n\n\nOtherwise... it's because they're curious about what an object is, or just bored.  If it becomes an issue for a cat owner it is recommended to spend more time playing with the cat - you'll find they will then spend less time pushing things off tables and shelves.  "},

Furthermore I am aware that in Australia unless multiple reports are made there is often no follow up by the CPS **unless** suspected sexual abuse is reported, in which case there is mandatory follow up. I dont understand please explain","answer":"Sexual abuse typically involves other forms of abuse, compounding the effect. Physical and emotional abuse and neglect are often required on the part of the abuser to engage in sexual abuse. Where as other forms of abuse can happen simultaneously or independently of each other. I can't speak to the severity of one abuse versus another because it has far more to do with the abused person than the act itself.

{"title":"ELI5: If ISIS has the same enemies as the US and NATO, why aren't they \"easy\" to defeat?","question_detail":"I've searched and seen questions similar to mine asked about ISIS, but asked in a uni/bilateral perspective.\n\nLooking at [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant#Islamic_criticism), there are forces that the US/NATO are in conflict with that are against ISIS as well.\n\nGroups like AQD, the Taliban, Hezbollah, Al-Assad's Syrian army, the Mujhadeen, the Al-Nusra front are all terror groups that are anti-US/NATO in addition to being anti-ISIS.\n\nNow I understand that this isn't a group large enough that the US supports engaging directly, nor are other countries welcome to the idea of letting the US use their country as a base to fight them, seeing as we have tendency to never leave.  I also am not suggesting in anyway possible that any kind of strategic alliances would or should ever be formed to fight the scumbags either.\n\nWhy aren't they so easily defeated when virtually the entire world shares a hatred for them?\n\nAren't they writing a check their asses won't be able to cash on a global scale?","answer":"If we were to fight them this would be a very complicated and long fight. On one hand we could send ground troops in and have a fight like we did in afganistan and Iraq or on the other hand we could just bomb them. On the second option we would have to make an ally in the ground (probably would be the Kurds). This war is going to be long no matter what we do. Isis has an estimated 30000 soldiers give or take some. At its strongest al-queda had 20000 and it took us 15 years of fighting them to get them down to a more manageable number (they are still dangerous). Regardless of what we do this will not be a quick fight. I think we need to send ground troops in now. If we keep doing what we are doing which is a small amount of bombing we will let Isis gain in strength. And soon enough it will bite us in the ass.

Studies show that about 10% to 20% of women who know they are pregnant have a miscarriage some time before 20 weeks of pregnancy; 80% of these occur in the first 12 weeks. But the actual rate of miscarriage is even higher since many women have very early miscarriages without ever realizing that they are pregnant. One study that followed women's hormone levels every day to detect very early pregnancy found a total miscarriage rate of 31%.\"\n\nTo put that in perspective, most women at some point in their lives will either have or know someone who has miscarried...likely more than once. Unfortunately miscarriage is often swept under the rug, something that shouldn't be talked about, often blaming the women for the loss...the result is that people, men and women alike, bare the burden of miscarriage alone.  Both men and women need to understand that they are not alone in dealing with their loss, it is not uncommon, and communities need to have strong support systems and resources for people who have suffered through miscarriage.\n\n"},

There it gathers more water, which then freezes, and gets a bit bigger. This happens a couple times depending on the winds but it eventually gets heavy enough to fall and falls as hail. \nSnow just falls.\nThis is why you can get hail during strong thunderstorms even if it's warm on the ground, in the atmosphere it's quite cold."},

{"title":"ELI5: If water evaporate at 100*C, how does it stay evaporated in the air to form clouds? Wouldnt the cold temperature make it turn from gas to liquid (or solid) instantly and make it rain on us again?","answer":"Water evaporates at all temperatures (in a very broad sense).  Evaporation occurs when surface molecules dissociate from the rest of the liquid.\n\nWhat happens at 100C, (in normal or lab conditions), is boiling.  At boiling temperatures, the phase change can happen throughout the parcel of water.\n\nClouds are tiny drops of liquid, suspended in air.  So, it does happen, but not instantly.  \n\nThink of water as it \"dissolves\" in air.  The molecules rise, and cool, and when then cool, the stick to each other and form droplets.  They can also stick to other cool surfaces and condense there, like on glass or leaves.\n\nSo, the evaporation separates the molecules, their re-condensing is not instant, but takes time.  If it's very cold, or very high pressure, they will condense faster."},

{"title":"ELI5: If the earth's trash gets too much for us to dispose of properly, would it be possible to load them on the detachable parts of spacecraft?","answer":"That's not a good idea, for three reasons:\n\n1) Launching things into space is incredibly expensive. The low end of the range is $4,000 per pound, and although future advances might reduce that cost even further, it's just never going to be a cost-effective method of waste disposal.\n\n2) All of that stuff falls back down, eventually. If you *did* manage to launch your garbage along with part of a rocket, it would just end up falling back down. Depending on the details, it might burn up on re-entry, but it's hard to see how that's better than burning it in a municipal incinerator.\n\n3) But it won't necessarily fall back to earth right away. It could sit, in a decaying orbit, for years or decades. In other words, it could become a long-term navigation hazard for useful satellites and spacecraft. Space debris is *already* a problem.\n\nOf these three, the first is by far the most significant. It just costs hundreds of times more money to even try to launch garbage into space than it does to recycle, burn, or just bury it."},

And when that elephant grows up and lays eggs of its own, they wouldn't resemble the egg it hatched out of, they'd resemble elephant eggs.\n\n&gt;That is indeed the crux of the problem. Does the identity of the egg come from its layer, or its inhabitant?

","answer":"&gt; I'm not a historian, but the roots of anti-semitism in Europe during the middle ages was primarily due to the belief that jews had killed Jesus, etc (I'm not very knowledgable on religion either). From what I understand, anti-semitism turned to actual hatred in the 1800's, when many poor jews immigrated from Russia, and - according to mainstream european belief, of course - leached on society and refused to integrate themselves; notice the similarity with modern-day xenophobia.\n\nIt's a little more complex - the Jewish community were some of the first money lenders and have dominated the money-lending industry.\n\nYou know how everyone wails on bankers these days?\n\nThat sentiment is nothing new, and when the vast majority of your bankers are jewish, the sentiment carries over to the people rather than the profession. In Germany, Jews were represented disproportionately in major finance and industrial circles because of this heritage.\n\nIf Jews made up 5% of the population (say, I don't know), but occupied 50% of the top trade positions, or seats in the German National Bank, then it's no surprise that when repressed Germans who had seen their country asset stripped in WW1 reparations, who's economy was down the swanny, and who were facing a wave of nationalist feeling from the [Völkisch movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%B6lkisch_movement), might feel anger at that, and even make 2+2=5 and reach the conclusion that it was the *fault* of the Jewish community keeping good, honest, hard-working Germans down!\n\nThere were also some early scientific papers coming out about physical differences between different races. Whilst slavery had been abolished, science was becoming aware that there are some differences between people of different races beyond skin colour (a lot of Africans and Afro-Caribbeans being great track athletes for one).\n\nA little knowledge is a dangerous thing though, and the Nationalist Movement jumped on this early days research, pushing for a common, pure Germany, by Germans, for Germans.

{"title":"ELI5:What is the difference between sarcastic and ironic?","answer":"Sarcasm and irony are closely related so it's hard to parse out.  In general, I believe that all sarcasm is irony, but not all irony is sarcasm.  \n\nSarcasm is expressing something the opposite of what you mean, usually to be spiteful or cruel.  Irony is creating a situation that is the opposite of the expected or meant.  So both involve things being the opposite of what you mean, but sarcasm is usually for cruelty and irony can be used for comedy.  Also sarcasm I believe is strictly related to communication of some sort, you have to speak or behave in a sarcastic manner whereas you can make a situation ironic where no one is actively using words opposite of their meaning.  \n\nAlso, strictly speaking, irony and sarcasm are both man made, which is where a ton of confusion comes from.  Life can't be ironic (unless you believe in a god that's writing the details of your life), it can just be coincidental.  For example, if a house catches fire on Water Street, that's a coincidence and not ironic.  Now if a stripper names herself Chastity, that's ironic because it's intentionally playing on the meaning of the words.  Coincidence will always be coincidence, irony will always be created.  "},

Building a road, even if it's a fairly lousy one, will give huge benefits. It's worth the massive investment.\n\nAn industrial country has an existing road between 2 cities. It could be better, smoother, faster, hold more traffic, etc but it already exists. Improving it will not give very much additional benefit.

{"title":"ELI5: Why required statutory retirement age for males is bigger then for women in most countries?","question_detail":"Especially considering that life expectancy is shorter for man and man usually do the most physically intensive and thus, in a long term, most crippling jobs.","answer":"In the UK, the separate ages of 60 and 65 were introduced in 1940 and are gradually being equalised now. The original motivation seems to have been to deal with married women who were younger than their husbands, since most married women didn't work and qualified for a pension only through their husbands' contributions.\n\nWhen the husband retired at 65, he would be entitled to a pension but his wife would not until she also reached 65. Setting the pensionable age for women at 60 meant that most married women would be able to draw a pension when their husbands did. In the opposite case, the wife was already only eligible for a pension once her husband reached 65, even if she was older than him."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why are there 13 INCOTERMS and only 2 or 3 are used?","question_detail":"My economics professor told us there are like 13 INCOTERMS used in the world but only a few are often used (as far as he knows).","answer":"There is actually currently 11 incoterms (some were removed from the past standard). What each incoterm does is basically denote whether a certain shipping action falls under the responsibility of the seller or the buyer. That means each incoterm has different costs and risks. In some industries there is an industry wide culture of using one incoterm over the other, sometimes simply because that is how trade always has been done. Additionally government regulations might make using one incoterm more profitable than another. For example, customs duties in India are calculated against the CIF (Cost, Insurance and Freight) price of the goods. That means that pretty much the majority of trade with India will be done using the CIF incoterm simply because it simplifies things / removes extra costs. "},

It is one thing to have a reflex, but there are complex behaviors (such as baby sea turtles crawling towards the ocean) are much tougher to explain. \n\nThere was  a recent neuroscience paper that came out that may help. Basically, they fear conditioned some male animals to a certain smell (i.e. made them scared of the smell).  They then had these males sire offspring. The offspring learned to be afraid of the smell much quicker than would normally be the case. They examined their olfactory system, and found that these offspring had increased receptors that were specific to the smell their Dad's had been made afraid of. Basically, making the Dad's afraid of a smell resulted in their offspring being particularly sensitive to that smell.\n\nThis is called epigenetics: when experiences result in altered gene expression.  Therefore, it is indeed possible, in a sense, for a \"memory\" to be passed on, although it isn't the memory per se, it is altered gene expression. "},

I certainly understand the short term issues - wildlife dying from exposure to the oil, mess everywhere, etc.  But oil is naturally occurring substance and biodegradable, right?  Long term, is it really catastrophic?","answer":"Well, just because something is natural, doesn't mean you want to spread it all over the place or that it's not a big deal if it spills.\n\nFor instance, mercury is I think the second most toxic thing on earth next to plutonium if I'm not mistaken.  Both are naturally occurring, however both are extremely poisonous.  Just a tiny amount can contaminate a lake so much that they will be closed for fishing.\n\nOil is no different and it spreads on water for one, so it can cover a vast amount of surface.  Then when dolphins and whales come up to breath, the take in a lung full of crude as well as air.  Birds land in the oil and can't fly after.  Light doesn't penetrate the surface as easily.  Fish get poisoned when the oil enters their gills.  Fish and other animals also become toxic which can ruin livelihoods that depend on fishing of sorts.  It pollutes beaches.  There are many reason's they are catastrophic.\n\nIf you'd like to know more, just check out the wiki page on the [exxon valdez](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exxon_Valdez_oil_spill#Clean-up_and_environmental_impact)"},

But telecom service providers are claiming that Over The Top services (OTT) like Skype, WhatsApp, Hangouts, Facebook etc. are stealing huge revenues from their current infrastructure. And hence they are proposing differential charging for these services (apart from the normal internet charges). However, needless to say the market is highly unwilling to accept this change. Can you please explain whether such a change is actually required? Whether such net-based messaging and calling services ***do*** take up quite a bit of their infrastructure? Or whether it is just an excuse for these companies to reap off the benefits as these are clearly one of the most used and easiest forms of communication medium of this era?","answer":"Essentially they are annoyed that these services are being used instead of their own for sending messages and pictures. Making them charge extra for these services would render the reason for them existing more or less pointless. It would also create go against net neutrality principles which is why it must never happen. \nEdit: Also even if they take up a large proportion of network traffic it can't possibly come close to the level of traffic generated by streaming video and music.

This makes n+1 and n-1 even, but it also means one of them has to be divisible by 4. So if one is divisible by 4 and the other is divisible by 2, then their product is divisible by 8.\n\nSimilarly, n cannot be divisible by 3, therefore either n+1 or n-1 are divisible by 3, so the product is divisible by 3.\n\nSo, since n^(2)-1 is divisible by 3 and 8, it must be divisible by the least common multiplier, which is 24."},

How does this compare to the Samsung Galaxy S6's Quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 2.1 GHz Cortex-A57?","answer":"A tiny bit off the topic but...\n\nI have been using computers 80% of my waking hours since I was 13 years old.\n\nAnd to be honest as much as I loved computers I was never satisfied with them.\n\nI would drool over every mhz added to the new CPU units that came out each year.\n\nMy first computer was a 386/sx and had 25 mhz of CPU processing power with 2 megs of ram. I remember playing wolfenstein and kings quest on it.\n\nI remember the first 125mhz computer at school and soon after that a 135mhz.\n\nI finally left home and bought a new computer. And by that time the average CPU speed was a whopping 800mhz.\n\nI remember playing lands of lore and realms of the haunting. I thought back then that realms of the haunting had near realistic graphics. And marveled over the game.\n\nBut honestly computers still didn't satify me in some way.\n\nWhile using them I would literally have my ear to the side of the case listening to every click and beep that they made. And trust me they sure did a lot of clicking back then.\n\nThe cpu speed went up and up until it was hovering around the 4 gigahertz level. \n\nBut by that time on a deep fundamental level I didn't care about the mhz speed and instinctively would fantasize about owning a mother board that supported dual CPUs.\n\nI never did end up buying a computer with two CPUs in the mother board but the day that I heard about new dual core technology I knew instantly that the computer age was taking very big turn. Especially with the theoretical possibility of a 52 core cpu or whatever they were saying back then.\n\nThe reason why you want a CPU with multiple cores is because there are so many programs running simultaneously.\n\nBut the real cream on the pudding was multiple core CPUs coupled with the awesomeness of solid state hard drives.\n\nI am now very satisfied with my computer.\n\nI see only two big steps left.

{"title":"ELI5: Why should we care if an animal goes extinct?","question_detail":"Now I understand that there are many, many reasons why we would want to keep many animals alive, as they are important to their ecosystem, their environment, a valuable resource for us etc.\n\nHowever, I'm just talking about the 'poster boy' animals such as white rhinos, siberian tigers and pandas.\n\nObviously, since there are so few of these animals left we know that there wouldn't be *massive* effects if they were wiped out, since we would be feeling them already, with such a huge decline in population.\n\nSo why do we care so much about keeping them around?\n\nI mean I do understand some reasons why we should, but it seems that the amount of fucks people give about them is vastly greater than their value (aesthetics, variety, ethics) etc.\n\nIt would be horrible for humans to be wiped out, as we have a society and a sense of ourselves as a species, rather than just a family group or an individual and it would be devastating for us to know that no humans are going to be around any more.\n\nHowever, animals have no idea of such things, so the last individual of a species dying is no worse than any individual of that species dying, from their point of view.","answer":"&gt; Why should we care if an animal goes extinct?\n\nThe reason is because many of the current extinctions are not caused by natural forces (e.g. competition, natural disaster). Most extinctions can be traced back to human causes (e.g. habitat loss, hunting, pet trade). We are the problem, we can be the solution.\n\nSometimes we don't protect the endangered species directly. For example, it might be better to protect a species that requires a large territory. In so doing we protect all the other species that occupy that territory. For example, we might have an endangered migratory bird that requires protection. It doesn't get much attention or funding because it is so small, and perhaps even ugly. So instead, conservationists protect the bear that occupies that habitat. Bears require a lot of space, and by protecting the bear they protect the bird. These are called *umbrella species* because if we protect them, we can protect a lot of other species at the same time. This is why \"poster boy species\" are so important to protect, because they end up protecting a lot of other species at the same time.\n\n&gt; So why do we care so much about keeping them around?\n\nEvolutionary change does not usually progress in a matter of years, but a matter of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years. Species don't typically \"just go extinct\" it takes a long long time for a species to finally meet it end. Humans are like an asteroid, or some cataclysmic event. We wipe out whole ecosystems, whole species in a matter of years or generations. They don't have a fighting chance. So how can we prove a species isn't fit for its current environment? How can we prove that they are not worth saving? Especially when we are at the root of the problem. Finally, sometimes we only know how important a species is to the functioning of its ecosystem when they are already gone, when it is already too late. \n\nWithin a functioning ecosystem all things are linked. If you start breaking the links in the food web and you start removing species it weakens the whole ecosystem. There isn't an ecosystem on this planet that humans don't use in some respect for our own gain, so all ecosystems are important to us and our survival. We need healthy functioning ecosystems in order to be able to live and thrive on this planet. More importantly healthy ecosystems provide humans direct and immediate [ecosystem services](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem_services) for free - services that would cost humans billions of dollars to do ourselves with our own technology. An extinct species here and there might not make a big difference, but we are not talking about one or two species. Were talking about thousands and thousands of species, from all ecosystems and all kinds of life. We aren't just messing around with a few links, we are systematically working away at the very foundations that are keeping our ecosystems running in such a way that they benefit ourselves. \n\nI find that this is a pretty good analogy: ecosystems are like a spider's web. Each silken thread is a different species. Some threads are more important, for example the four or five threads that secure the web to the branches. If these threads are cut, the whole web just falls right apart, instantly. No cushion, no fall back. Gone. Some species act like those threads. They hold the whole thing up - they are that important. We call these species [keystone species](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_species). A very good example are [Atlantic Cod](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse_of_the_Atlantic_northwest_cod_fishery). Back in the early 90's we nearly fished out all the Atlantic Cod. We destroyed the ecosystem, the fishery collapsed. We finally decided to put a moratorium on fishing, hoping that the stocks would recover and with it, the local fishing economy. It hasn't, it very likely won't. Why? Because the cod were the keystone species, and without them the ecosystem changed forever and it won't go back. There is still a moratorium, there is still no fishing allowed. The economy has never recovered. People lost their livelihoods. One species, millions of dollars, and a huge negative human impact because of our greed. Ok, but those are the keystone species...if we protect them then were ok right? Problem is we often don't know what the keystone species is until its too late, by then it is really hard for us to help the ecosystem recover. A great example of a keystone species we were able to help recover were [sea otters](http://www.exploringnature.org/db/detail.php?dbID=7&amp;detID=77) although their populations have not fully recovered, we are making good headway. [More on keystone species](http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/encyclopedia/keystone-species/?ar_a=1)\n\nThe second issue is that we can still destroy the spiders web even if we save the key anchor threads. In other words, an ecosystem can still be in a lot of trouble, even if we place a lot of effort on protect key species. This is because the other threads, while perhaps not as important, all help stabilize and give the web and give it its shape and function. Loose one or two threads, no big deal the web can still function. But loose 10%? 50%? 80%? of the threads and now you begin to have a serious problem. The web looses its function, and collapses. The same with ecosystems. Resilient ecosystems are healthy ecosystems, and healthy ecosystems make us money. A dysfunctional, unhealthy ecosystem is of no use to us in the long term. It isn't sustainable for us, or for the animals that live there.\n\n**Past major extinction events**\n\nThe Earth has seen between 70-95% of species lost in past [major extinction events](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_event#Major_extinction_events). There have been a total of 5 major events in the Earth's history. These are usually caused by a myriad of factors (asteroids, sustained volcanic activity) but the fact remains that they are catastrophic. Yes, life has survived and pulled through these past 5 events - but not all kinds of life. Many different kinds of species went extinct, whole groups of species went extinct. It would be hubris to assume that humans are not susceptible to extinction ourselves. We are after all, a species just like any other on this planet. By all accounts, humans are now in the midst of a 6th major extinction. Only the culprit isn't an asteroid or a volcano, it us us. We are causing rates of extinction to be much much higher than the expected background rates. For example, [1 species of mammal is expected to go extinct every million years on average](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_extinction_rate)...we are experiencing rates that are 10x as high as this. We have been working hard and fast to destroy ecosystems, and most importantly we show no signs of slowing down. A world with 70-90% species loss is a world I do not want to experience, it is a world I do not want my children to experience. We are going down this path, a path that leads to an existence wherein it is just us, and our domestic animals (e.g. cows, pigs, dogs, sheep, chickens).\n\n\n"},
{"title":"ELI5 Why do we hear this little crackle sound in our ears when we swallow?","answer":"As I understand it, the brain is quite good at filtering out monotonous, constant stimuli. For example smell, the sensation of clothes pressing against the skin or the tongue resting in your mouth (can't stop feeling it now, can you? :) ). The clicking noise \"breaks through\" the filter sometimes and more so when we are thinking of it. If we were to experience all the sounds, smells, and other sensations of everyday life we would probably go insane. \nThere is a theory that some psychiatric diseases involves a \"broken filter\", such as schizophrenia.

{"title":"ELI5: Do those companies who seem to always have some sort of clearance or XX% off actually benefit from the advertisements?","answer":"Oh yes they do. Constantly offering discounts, especially discounts that seem time sensitive, is a very effective strategy. The thing is, the company never expects people to pay the full price - most of the time they don't even offer the product at the full price, it is just a made up price so you have an idea of what sort of discount you are getting. The discount price you pay is still more than enough to cover their costs and make them money. However psychologically, to you, buying something at a discount makes it seem like a better deal than buying without the discount even if the price is exactly the same.\n\nUhm. Let me take the example of television shopping channels. You know, the sort - the kind where you can buy a pan. And look, this pan can beat up other pans. But wait, if you call us right now, you do not get one pan, but two pans. And if you call within the next ten minutes, you will also be getting a special cleaning set thrown in on the deal.\n\nWe've all seen these commercials. And if you watch them often enough (because, for example, you are a freaking insomniac sometimes like me) you'll notice that they are always throwing in that second pan and that they are always telling you that if you phone within the next ten minutes, you'll get the cleaning set. That is because they are artificially trying to create scarcity. They are trying to trick you into believing you need to decide *right the fuck now*. And the thing is, when we are under time pressure, we generally don't make such good decisions anymore. When it comes to buying things, we tend to buy them just in case, cause we are worried we will beat ourselves up later over missing such a great deal. Now, the thing is, if we had actual time to consider these things, we probably wouldn't buy this thing - we'd use all that extra time to weigh the products against other products, and think about how often we really need it, and when did we buy new pans the last time. Usually, when we think about buying things logically, we realise we don't need this shit. That is why people that try to sell you shit, try and keep you from thinking logically. Our brain is amazing, don't get me wrong. But our brain is also easily tricked if we harness certain tendencies of the brain - such as the tendency to make different decisions when under time pressure, and our tendency to think of discounts as getting a better deal (even if we aren't really). \n\nAnd the thing is, when I say it like this, it seems to obvious. But we all still fall for it. If there is one thing that humans are, it is being bad at making logical decisions. Oh, we think we are so fucking logical, but we are not.

To win you need to destroy all of your opponents buildings not just their main building.  Also you may start with one main building but you can construct duplicates whenever you have the resources and in fact its pretty rare to nto have 3 or 4 main buildings (the Nexus for Protoss, Command Centre for terrans and the hatchery/Lair/Hive for the zerg)"},

It looks like Australian wildlife is pretty hazardous, more so than other well developed countries.","answer":"I think a big part of it is confirmation bias.  Maybe not all, but a lot.  The rest probably has to do with the fact that Australia has an extremely harsh climate.  The harsher the climate, the more the rule \"the strong survive\" applies.  This has led to there being an abundance of very nasty animals that are native to the area.\n\nBut as I said, I think it's mostly confirmation bias.

{"title":"ELI5:How does death occur when one dies while snorkeling?","question_detail":"I lost someone I love week before last, and my raggedy heart is looking for answers","answer":"One possibility which occurs with alarming frequency among breath-hold divers is shallow water blackout. The concentration of CO2 in the lungs is the body's primary stimulus to breathe. Under normal conditions, breaths are triggered well before there is insufficient oxygen in the lungs to sustain life. Divers figured out long ago that the CO2 stimulus could be suppressed by hyperventilating deeply for a few breaths prior to submersion, as this action clears out the residual CO2 in the lungs, delaying the stimulus. The problem is that this reduces the safety margin between feeling the urge to breathe and actually not having enough oxygen to stay alive, and blackouts can occur during the ascent. This can also be a problem with people who smoke, as they counterintuitively can appear to hold their breath for a very long time, but the reason is their acclimatization to elevated levels of CO2, meaning that they already have a narrow safety margin between the breathing stimulus and hypoxia.\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: Why are Terms & Conditions so 'shady'? Things like giving an app to record audio on your device at any time without the owner's confirmation, changing call logs, reading your text messages etc.","answer":"Unfortunately, the major mobile OS platforms (e.g. Apple iOS, Google Android etc.) don't provide app developers with ability to request permissions which are restrictive and specific in their scope.\n\nThe way these platforms function is that, when a developer wants to access a certain feature of the phone, the developer has to first obtain permission from the OS. However, even if the developer is just using the feature for a very specific and limited purpose, the developer has no choice but to issue a request for very broad permissions in order to access that feature. For example, if you want to build an app that lets the user - at any point - record audio or send an audio message etc., you may be forced to request broad permissions from the OS for 'access to the microphone to record audio at all times' (or something like that).\n\nAs an app developer, you have no way of adding more specificity or restrictions to your permissions request, you can't say 'I want my app to have access to the user's microphone only when the app is open and actively in use and the user presses a record button'. In order to access the microphone at all, you have no choice but to invoke a very generic request for full access to the microphone.\n\nThe same issue applies to other types of phone features (e.g. text message access, call logs etc.). There may be a legitimate reason why the app requires or requests access to those resources (perhaps for a very limited and specific purpose within the app), but in order to gain access to that feature, they basically have to ask you (the user) to give up full access to your phone."},

I know it's technically a two part question, but I have a morbid curiosity about how we'd go if we weren't in the direct line of fire.","answer":"If the planet \"fragmented\" as you say, its likely the atmosphere as we know it wouldn't exist anymore, or wouldn't be what it was before.\n\nIf that happens, humans and life on the planet are probably doomed from that alone."},

{"title":"ELI5:why do men go bald but women don't?","answer":"Male pattern baldness is complicated in its causal factors, but it is sex-linked (carried on the X sex chromosome) and sex-influenced (affected by hormone levels determined by sex).  Therefore, fewer women are seen to go bald than men, since it takes two X chromosomes with the \"bad\" gene(s) to be expressed.  Also, since it's a sex-influenced condition, affected women usually express with diffuse thinning of the hair which isn't as noticeable.

My cat Bandit lived 10+ years with a murmur without the slightest ill effect. \n\nIn humans, murmurs that have the potential to be impairing are usually corrected by surgery.

Her stride is 10m long. If she was going to move at 1 stride per second, she'd be moving ten times as fast as you - and moving 10 times the mass 10 times as fast is going to take so much more energy! She's bigger than you, so she can produce more energy per second in her body, but not that much! \n\nSo she only has enough energy to move her legs so she takes 1 stride every 4 seconds.

{"title":"ELI5: Blind hummingbird sits on the passenger seat in a car moving at 100MPH. He then flaps his wings to hover stationary for 3 minutes (not touching anything in the car) like he would normally outside the car. Does the hummingbird hit the back of the car's windscreen?","answer":"no, once the car starts accelerating (including speeding up, slowing down, or turning), that's a result of a force applied on the car, and the same force needs to be applied to the bird to keep it going. You can feel those forces yourself, but when you're at a constant velocity, you can't feel anything.\n\nMaybe this video will help: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYHMtP02t6M\n\nThe balloon stays floating in the same space as the guy drives at a constant speed, but moves around in the car when he accelerates."},
{"title":"ELI5: Shipping from China to U.S. Why does it take so long to get here?","answer":"Customs. US and Chinese customs both have very tight regulations that means they have to check all the packages. When I studied in an international school in Shanghai, our school's textbooks got detained by the Chinese customs because of reasons akin to \"regulation on the amount of foreign teaching material that can be imported\".\n\nI am unsure on US import laws but generally speaking any international delivery counts as import and customs have the duty to make sure that the goods that are imported are accounted for and do not violate the local laws.\n\nThey don't check all goods but mainly the ones that are shipped in large boxes / containers that are unopened. Which is why importing, say, a computer box set takes longer than a game disc."},

{"title":"ELI5: What's the point of a gender studies degree? What can you do with it after you graduate? What pratical knowledge do you learn?","question_detail":"Curious since all these post with gender studies things are coming up lately on the front page.","answer":"You can roughly break down bachelor's degrees into three categories:\n\n1. Professional degrees.  Engineering, nursing, and the like.  These are rigorous degrees, often accompanied by legal standards required to practice.  While you're not awarded a job with your diploma, it's pretty close - employers need people with those particular skill sets and they tend to need them badly.\n\n2. Finance and mathematics-related degrees.  Being able to work with money and mathematics are fundamental skills that are important to a huge swathe of jobs.  It's not remotely unusual to see a Physics major get hired by an investment bank solely on the basis of their mathematical training - despite the fact that the investment bank has no use for their Physics knowledge.\n\n3. Generic other.  Women's Studies falls here.  Degrees that neither lead to a professional certification nor involve significant mathematical elements are generally viewed as interchangeable by your average employer - they're merely a demonstration that you're reasonably teachable and stable.  Most people with this sort of degree will never work 'in their field' unless they continue on to the PhD level."},

{"title":"ELI5: Turbochargers and Superchargers","answer":"Yes. Even superchargers or turbochargers can be bad for the engine if they're not properly tuned and timed. Your car's engine is only built to certain tolerances for temperature and pressure, exceeding these specifications can wear the motor out pretty quick. Go too far beyond what the engine was built to handle and you'll blow it up... bend connecting rods or break pistons.\n\nBut NOS is particularly bad because it's all torque. It's incredibly powerful. If you're not careful with it you can shoot your piston rings to shit in a hurry or blow the motor. NOS reacts to heat and pressure, chemically adding more oxygen to the combustion chamber. It can cause pre-ignition of the fuel... an uncontrolled burn that can interfere with the flame front from the spark... that's never a good thing. But if it's properly set up and used carefully, it's manageable."},

{"title":"ELI5:How do budget airlines survive, what exactly are they cutting back on & does it make flying with them a higher risk?","question_detail":"I only ask as im looking at flights personally, and there is a budget airline offering flights to Milan from London at £48 return, whereas Alitalia & British Airways are both circa £1000 for the same dates. Either the big airlines overcharge massively, or the budget ones are seriously cutting back on something, but what.","answer":"I suspect you are going to be flying from stanstead to bergamo on the budget airline and likely heathrow to malpensa on the flag carriers. That may not matter to you, but when I last made that flight i was connecting in from Denver and my connecting flight came into heathrow. (Though flying that last november cost me less than $1000 including the DEN-LHR and LHR-DEN legs)\n\nHeathrow is simply a more valuable destination because it's closer to the city and had a lot more airlines there. You pay for that. \n\nThe other major thing missing from some budget carriers is that they don't support multi leg itineraries. If you miss a ryanair connection then they'll make you buy another ticket. If you miss a BA connection for anything that was remotely BAs fault then they'll schedule you (sometimes even on another airline) and if you are delayed overnight you'll end up in a decent hotel.

Manoeuvre stopped when machine guns minced horse cavalry and pinned down foot soldiers. The foot soldier dug fox holes for cover and eventually joined up individual foxholes into trenches. Stalemate. \n\nEventually artillery improved (air burst shells and rolling barrages) which made the trenches vulnerable and infantry warfare again became mobile. "},
{"title":"ELI5: Why does money have to be backed by something like gold?","question_detail":"I have always heard money only has value if backed by something such as gold. To 99.9% we never think of money in terms of whatever it is backed by. We just respect it's theoretical value to exchange goods or services. Can someone explain why we couldn't abandon any backing od currency and just accept the idea of monetary value? \nFor example let's say Cheetos instead of money (pretend like you wouldn't eat them). You give me 10 Cheetos for my pocket watch. I give my neighbor 3 Cheetos to clean my car. Now that the wealth is being distributed and the value of the Cheeto has been accepted, life could go on knowing that your Cheeto will always be used as the tool for measuring the value of an exchange. (Sorry for the drawn out and strange analogy. This just confuses me.) \nSo why couldn't this senario work for money?","answer":"It seems a little misguided to say fiat money is worthless in this sense. It does have a value because people agree to use it, and governments back it up. It is a preferable alternative to the barter system, which unfortunately is even more subject to things like monopolies. You have the only cows left in existence. You breed them. Only trade them for the most slaves or corn or whatever. Money circumvents this problem, because it adheres to a social contract."},

After a 100 year sentence, why don't they just say life without parole?","question_detail":"I read recently that an individual had been sentenced to life in prison without parole plus 165 years, for murder. What's the purpose of tacking on the 165 years? It seems completely irrelevant. \n\nEDIT: Thank y'all. Great discussion.","answer":"It's true that the law is about being just, so how is it fair to give lesser crimes harsher penalties. Hacking a few websites and taking them down can earn you more jail time than a murder. Like I said, the severity of the crime doesn't always reflect the sentence.\n\nI don't think it rewards you for committing more crime anymore than stacking penalties does because say you were gonna get ~100 years, any more years after that is still a death-in-prison sentence. So stacking further penalties surely doesn't dissuade the criminal either? I guess it might delay the problem a little but still.. hmm!"},
{"title":"ELI5: Why can't software developers, like Microsoft, just put a straight end to malware?","question_detail":"In 2015, digital computers have been around for decades, how can developers still be making highly vulnerable software that needs anti-malware to stay healthy?","answer":"Unless you used Internet Explorer, you posted this comment from a piece of software that you personally installed on your system and wasn't included out of the box.  The browser you are using has the ability to write and edit files in your system, send information over the internet, log your browsing history, and many, many additional 'potential security risk' function.  \n\nIn order to fully stop malware, you'd need a closed system that doesn't allow you to install 'aftermarket' software, like your browser.

Red, green and blue.  And those receptors limit us to view a portion of the color spectrum that we see in a rainbow or a prism.

{"title":"ELI5: How do floating bridges work like the I-90 bridge in Seattle, WA?","answer":"Lake Washington, which the I90 and SR520 floating bridges cross, is a very strange lake.\n\nIt is a deep furrow gouged into the earth during the last Ice Age.  It's a narrow body of water that is extremely deep.  It's so deep that sinking supports into the bottom for a bridge is impractical.\n\nIt is also wider than the distance engineers are comfortable building suspension bridges. It might be possible but it would also be very expensive and a real technical challenge.\n\nThe floating bridge is the compromise solution that makes the system work.  (Lake Washington needs to be bridged because there are lots of people and businesses on both sides of the lake that need to get to the other side regularly, and the lake is long enough in the North/South axis that driving around it is a real pain in the ass.)\n\nOn both sides of the lake the bridge begins pretty traditionally with a roadway that is supported by structures that stand on the bottom of the lake. Those segments transition rapidly to a roadbed that is actually floating right on the lake itself. The floating part of the roadbed is built out of large multi-segment concrete structures that are buoyant.  They're anchored to the lakebed with huge cables so they can't move much in any direction.  They're so massive that even when there's a good chop on the lake the roadbed doesn't move very much, and the road itself is segmented along its length with joints allow it to flex in the swell.  When you drive on it, 99% of the time you'd never know you were floating on the water (and that 1% of the time it's still really hard to tell just from the movement of the road).\n\nThe middle of the SR520 bridge has a section that can be opened to let boat traffic through but it is rarely used these days.  The road segments from the shore to the floating sections are built so they begin very high above the water which creates a way to sail all but the largest boats under them (and the I90 bridge's raised segments are so high that you could sail just about anything under them)."},

In one, the person is an employee and most employees are at-will employees, which mean they can be fired for any (legal) reason at any time. As a school administrator, they may have had an employment contract but it would've had some sort of personal conduct clause that such statements would have violated.\n\nTrump's deal was a business partnership, where they chose to sell his branded clothing.

{"title":"ELI5: In the music world, when something is \"sung in D minor\" or \"played in the tune of F\". . . What does this exactly mean?","question_detail":"I suspect that if something is \"played in the key of G flat\" then the first note of the song is played G flat. Is this correct? ","answer":"Yes, depending on the context in which the notes are used. Yes, notes occur at all kinds of different frequencies, not just in the few patterns Westerners are trained to hear them, and those notes that are \"in-between\" for us (i.e. wrong or out-of-tune) are perfectly right in other traditions.\n\nAlso no, because, generally speaking, if you say \"this is a melody in G major\" and play other notes not in the key (other pitches as designated by Western music theory, or quarter-tones), you'd be \"wrong\". \n\nJust some information of note - jazz music has a more flexible definition of \"in the key\". Not only because many kinds of jazz music feature key changes all over the tunes, but also because jazz musicians deliberately decorate their melodies with notes that live \"outside\" the key centre. Sometimes those notes resolve to a more pleasing note in the key, and sometimes they stay outside for harmonic interest. These notes are chosen on purpose with many years of study behind the musicians, and aren't considered \"wrong\"."},

For instance the Turkish state and other groups around the world use calculations to decide when the new month’s begin, i.e. calculating the eid-al-fitr holiday of the Ramadan. Even Apple does it and puts it into the agendas on their devices. This results into a difference in methodology (calculating v.s. adhering strictly to the apparent meaning of Islamic law). This also results into different factions/groups within the Islamic community and causes disunity. The devices/methods you spoke of to calculate are already present and have been for over a thousand of years. \n\nI don’t know your background but law students are taught that there are several ways to interpret text/laws. One of them is context-historical and another one is according to the grammar (literal) sense. This is a case where you simply just have to follow the already established rules. The people who use calculations don’t have to come up with new things, because in this case it would result into denying/ignoring narrations that prescribe these matters.\n"},

With a family of \"social\" drinkers and heart problems, it does affect me directly.\n\nYour points are all pretty much true.\n\n* Wine does indeed have antioxidants, *but non-alcoholic wine does too*.\n\n* I've read *very* vague statements along the same lines - up to and including helping prevent gallstones. Can't find any definitive studies though.\n\nAlcohol is, as you say a depressant. However, it's not a directly psychological or neurological depressant - it does not have the depressant effect directly on our brain. It's a cardiovascular one. Meaning it slows your heart rate, which our brains generally associate with \"calming\", even if it is the effect of an outside cause - alcohol. Which then in turn feeds back into the brain relaxing.\n\nI think part of that \"unwinding with a glass in the evening\" is a societal construct and placebo effect. While the biological effects are there, they are not powerful enough to turn someone who is utterly stressed out leaving work, into just a regular chill person in such a short space of time. I think the simple act of leaving the stressful environment, coming home to loved ones and comfort is far more influential.\n\nHowever, sitting down with a drink is seen as part of that. Especially considering many behaviours like that are reinforced with information like \"French and Italian people live far longer and are generally healthier because they...(enter buzzterms)\". In this case, drink a lot. How many times have we seen that exact thing? The other major one thrown about is \"because of all the oils in their diet\". Not, you know, because of the better overall standard of living in those areas, due to lack of stress, better climate - and the myriad of other things that aren't taken into consideration when comparing lifestyles.\n\nI think we need to consider that a lot of the information out there can suffer from all sorts of bias. In particular, confirmation bias. Where a source has set out to prove their point, and so even things like raw statistics can be misinterpreted to get the answer they want.\n\nElsewhere someone accused me of spreading misinformation, my view is always, always, *always* check your sources. Some are written to reinforce people's existing notions and ideas, basically just to get them to read the article - which means either buying a publication or giving them site traffic."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why is the periodic table set out like it is?","answer":"Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev started laying out elements in a table, arranging them in order of certain properties, and he noticed that some of the properties were similar, and by arranging elements in rows and columns in a certain way, he created a chart where properties fell into neat little columns.\n\nBut far fewer elements were known in those days, and so Mendeleev found \"holes\" in his chart where there *should* be an element with such-and-such properties, but science knew of no such element.\n\nThus, Mendeleev's chart actually *predicted* things we hadn't observed yet. As chemistry got better, we started discovering elements that fit in all those holes, and they had exactly the properties Mendeleev predicted. If we had found a new element and it *didn't* fit into one of the holes, then Mendeleev's chart theory would have been busted, and scientists would look for a new theory.\n\nThis is really a textbook example of how a good scientific theory works."},
{"title":"ELI5: What can we expect from 5G and why will it be another ~5 years before it will release?","question_detail":"I was reading the [wiki article about 5G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G), and most of it I do not understand. What are the differences between 5G and 4G?\n\nFurther, why does it take a decade to release the next level?","answer":"5G won't be this new magical thing, but it will just be better. We will still use LTE and GSM, but CDMA will *eventually* be phased out. \r2G/3G/4G/5G are all based on standards and are improvements on each other.\rExisting network hardware is meant to perform faster and more efficiently with new standards but of course new hardware will be even faster and more efficient.\r4G saw significant improvements from 3G in that they provided vastly faster data speeds for the end user and better network resource management for carriers.\rSmartphones are relatively new for the wireless network industry.\rThese improvements are notable because they made smartphones more usable with data. The technology that makes newer smartphones require even more complex communication with networks(and the number of antennas in phones are increasing).\r5G is meant to address the way these systems communicate with each other. \r5G is not just one thing, it's a lot of things, and it requires the participation of several players within the industry worldwide. So its not just a switch or SW you can implement.\r\rHowever even now, without 5G, some carriers are implementing new features. Two notable ones are VoLTE and EMBMS.\rVoLTE is voice over LTE, and is meant to be higher voice quality.\rVerizon is pushing phone makers to implement EMBMS, which is like streaming live TV to many users. NFL wants to use this to broadcast the game to everyone's smartphones within the stadium. This is not possible now due to network limitations.\r\rTLDR: It won't necessarily seem like a new magical thing like 4G was compared to 3G, but it will be faster and more efficient.\rBut it takes time because its based on standards and there's a lot, a lot of companies involved."},

Is this common for others?  What is the benefit of trading vs selling?","answer":"It's usually because the trade is worth less to them than paying cash, regardless of what the value of the item they're willing to trade is worth. Thus the idea is to get a better 'deal' without costing money. Not to mention that if you find the right person, you can come to a mutually beneficial trade without using much or if any money.\n\nTrading is a way where someone if done continuously flipping hundreds of times with different items, that they can obtain exponentially higher value items compared to where they started at."},
{"title":"ELI5: In divorces, if both of the involved have a job, why does one part have to pay a compensation to the other one?","question_detail":"And why is the man the one who pays in most of the cases?","answer":"Alimony - the \"compensation\" you're referring to - is very rare nowadays, and occurs only when the  spouse (typically the wife) was a homemaker during the marriage.  The assumption is that caring for the home freed her husband to earn.  Usually alimony ends when the one receiving it remarries or gets a job.\n\nThe other kind of compensation is child support, and that's directly related to who has custody of the kids.  Even if my husband's ex got a raise that quadrupled her income, he would still have to pay child support."},
{"title":"ELI5: Why would anyone ever vote for Donald Trump for president?","answer":"Trump basically sells himself on the fact that he is an outsider to washington and therefore not subject to lobbying and corruption that comes with it. Since conservatives are distrusting of the political class, this is effective rhetoric. Trump also resonates because he brings up issues that more moderate conservatives have shyed away from, immigration being the biggest one, which causes his conservative base to see him as a man that stands by his principles despite the negative backlash that may come with it."},

{"title":"ELI5: If your mail can't be searched without suspicion how do most people get caught shipping drugs?","question_detail":"If someone was sending pot, or cocaine, or whatever and there was no smell or visible evidence how would they be caught? Is there a process of screening packages that is legal?","answer":"If someone is under investigation for distribution of illicit drugs, mail coming in or out of their possesion becomes fair game if a judge agrees with the investigator, but it is simpler than that in reality.\n\nThe 'shipping' usually happens in \"big\" batches coming from outside the United States. Between legal issues and climate considerations (the weather climate, not the social climate) it is safer and easier to produce internationally and ship into the US. Anything coming through customs is subject to inspection and is not under the same protections as domestic mail.\n\nIt is hard to slip past both dogs AND machines, though not impossible. The trick is to send lots of packages and figure some will be caught and some will not--the international shipping volume is huge and it is simply not possible to search everything.\n\nOf what IS searched, either a dog will smell it or if it is seriously well prepped and packaged, the packaging materials and/or density of material (think bricks) will generally be picked up on scanning machines. Certainly some stuff gets through the scanning, but I would suspect most gets aroud the scanners by simply not being searched.\n\nOnce the goods are inside the US distribution is much better handled by couriers than by putting it in the mail.\n\nEdit: a dog or scanner in regards to domestic mail is not considered a 'search'; one of these has to alert before the item can be considered suspicious in most cases. Then authorities get involved and it gets messy if you are the sender, or retain possession after becoming aware of what is in it (And it's illicit)."},

If you leave your car somewhere where its thermometer is exposed to the sun, it will record a much higher temperature than was reported in the forecast. So there is no one single temperature that applies everywhere.\n* Thermometers measure their *own* temperature. If you put a thermometer in the sun, it will heat up and show a higher temperature than if it had been in the shade.\n* If you leave a car in the sun with the windows closed, the air inside heats up but the heat can't escape through the glass. The temperature inside the car will therefore become much higher than the temperature outside, even in the sun."},

{"title":"ELI5: On forms that ask for one's race, why are South Asians and East Asians considered one race \"Asian\" when they are so genetically different.","question_detail":"Practically everything that deals with race lumps South Asians (Indians, Pakistanis, etc.) and East Asians (Chinese, Korean, etc.) together under the single label \"Asian.\" Statistics and charts do this. Various forms do this.\n\nWhy are the two groups lumped into a single race when they are so vastly different?","answer":"You can insult my intelligence until you're blue in the face, but that kind of poor argumentation doesn't advance the point you want to make.\n\nRace is defined by sociologists and by biologists in several ways, and using any of the several definitions that I provided you, there are distinct racial groups within the human family. I provided the definition of sociological race in addition to the biological definitions of race in order to demonstrate that, in spite of the idea that race is a purely social construct, there are scientific definitions of race that validate the concept of race discussed by sociologists.\n\n\"Race, as a social construct, is a group of people who share similar and distinct physical characteristics.\"\n\n\"An ecological race is an ecotype, part of a species that is adapted to a different local habitat.\"\n\n\"A geographic race is geographically isolated from other populations and may or may not be morphologically identifiable.\"\n\nThe latter scientific definitions of race simply do not contradict the sociological one, so where you get that idea is a mystery to me. There is no conflict whatsoever between certain groups sharing \"distinct physical characteristics\" and that group acquiring these characteristics by being \"adapted to a different local habitat\" and \"geographically isolated from other populations\". These are perfectly congruous definitions of race.\n\nThese definitions of race are found on Wikipedia, and can be confirmed through various other sources, which I will list hereafter. You can of course perform your own searches. Within sociology and biology, there are clearly various human races, and it is only for political considerations that this obvious truth is debated.\n\nEcotype - a subspecies or race that is especially adapted to a particular set of environmental conditions.

{"title":"ELI5: Why aren't jurors matched to defendants demographically?","answer":"Indeed you make a very very valid point there, a quick google says the rough split is \n62.6% white only\n13.2% black\n1.2% native to the continent(indian/alaskan)\n2.4% mixed race\n17.1% hispanic \n\nfor some reason the numbers don't add up but source here http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html\n\nanyway, you highlight a natural problem with the system that the makeup of the US simply will cater for a bias, but in attempting to subvert that bias we remove the system from being probabilistic to deterministic which has inherit flaws. \n\nThe only realistic solution to not allow for in group bias is through cryptographically random number selection, possibly with social security numbers and then some mathematical functions to add more pseudorandom to the pool. \n\nSadly it's fair from perfect but the present system could be considered to be the most fair, you may get an all black jury or an all white one, you never know. In an ideal scenario this shouldn't matter but sadly it will. \n\n\nAlso with regards to your edit you are more than right that some replies do come across as so, even my own original comment may and very much will do. With incidents such as trayvon martin or Michael brown where there were many black people who saw through the media sensationalism and saw that in those cases the juries were right. \n\nYou are right though that some people if they were of a similar background could relate to the issue and would strive for a less life ruining sentence. However this ability to relate is again a factor that will make the jury potentially place a lighter sentence then the person should receive. \n\nWith regards to sentencing however I must say that I feel Britain and America are both messed up in how jails operate. I'd say Norway has the most efficient system in the world for handling criminals, their re-offense rate is so low that it really begs the question as to why we haven't adopted it? ... well i guess except for the whole it costs money thing and you know about how our governments feel about spending money on helping people over making money"},
{"title":"ELI5: If interest is owed on all loans and new money is created to repay them, how can a country ever be debt-free?","question_detail":"Wouldn't that just cause constant inflation?  Does that mean that poverty is the result of systemic causes rather than self-induced causes?\n\n*edit* am i being downvoted for not knowing enough? isn't that the point of eli5?\n\n*edit #2* so far i have gathered that when I take out a loan, the bank creates money by asking for it from the federal reserve, who has their money printed out by the Mint.\n\nI've researched that this increase in money supply, without a proportional increase in actual goods or services, causes inflation - resulting in a fall in purchasing power.\n\nSo my question, which is being altered as I slowly gather new information, still stands.  As the creation of new money to re-pay interest also requires new interest to later be repayed, how can any of these debts be payed?  Is it accurate to say that debt creates more debt?\n\n*edit #3* \nI welcome you to call me misinformed, as I just want to find out what's true and what's not based on the information I find on the internet.  I just want to know more about how the federal reserve + banks + mint operates, and if my current knowledge is true: if debt is something that can/cannot be repayed.\n\n*edit #4* why is it so difficult for me to get clear information about how the Federal reserve/banks and such operates?

Hitler believed he was helping create a better human race, suicide bombers think they 're helping the word by getting rid of sinners/non believers.

{"title":"ELI5:ELI5 where and how do we experience emotions, and how do we even have a feeling about something?","answer":"This is a question we don't have an answer for yet. We know base emotions like fear, lust, and anger come from the Limbic System in our brains, and get moderated into the more complex emotions and into coherent thoughts by the prefrontal cortex, but we have no idea at all how any of that works. We don't know what consciousness is or what causes it, and figuring that out will likely require building a computer we can simulate a human brain in real time with, which is likely about 30 years out."},

In the case of freshwater fish - predatory fish, birds ([kingfishers](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=kingfisher&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;gfe_rd=cr&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=image_result_group&amp;ved=0CCkQsARqFQoTCM2oqr2hrMcCFcYqiAodsD4CTw&amp;tbm=isch), [osprey](http://www.google.com/search?q=osprey&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;gfe_rd=cr&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;oq=osprey&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l10.12490.13293.0.13676.6.4.0.2.2.0.180.436.2j2.4.0....0...1ac.1.34.img..0.6.443.8XhdvZFEg1Y), eagles), bears, racoons, bats, snakes, crocodiles, lampreys, otters, weasels...\n\nThe colour of fish by and large would have to do the the clarity of the water. The clearer the water the farther down light can reach. Therefore it makes sense that we would mainly see colourful fish in shallow clear waters. The best example of this is obviously tropical reefs. In contrast, silty or murky water prevents light from penetrating, and thus colour wouldn't be as important. This applies both to freshwater rivers with heavy silt loads and dark murky ocean waters (particularly arctic waters, highly productive waters, or areas where rivers with high sediment load meet the ocean)."},

{"title":"ELI5: How can Saudi Arabia be the biggest sponsor of terrorism and still be allied with the US?","answer":"Why would saudi be allies with a bunch of christian zealots who don't like them? \n\nOh right, money, and not everyone in the US is a christian zealot no more than everyone in saudi is a terrorist.  The Saudi government is (officially) opposed to Al Qaeda etc.  They even revoked Osama bin ladens citizenship years ago (1994 I think).  They weren't opposed to the taleban, but they are separate (if related) groups.  Remember Al Qaeda hates the house of Saud as much as anyone, as they are opposed to the monarchy.  \n\nThe problem is that Saudi arabia has a lot of people, and is rich. Even the royal family has (literally) thousands of princes, all of whom collect money from the Saudi state (basically from the saudi oil and natural gas revenue).  Some of them are more or less sympathetic to terrorists than others.  \n\nJust the same the official position of the US government is that Islam is fine, and that muslims are free to live and work without persecution within the US, and discrimination and harassment are not allowed.  Except for all of those 'random' TSA screenings and the not so subtle anti - islam rhetoric of lots of people.   The Saudi's know that the vast majority of americans are in fact not bigots, and the US knows that the majority of the house of Saud are not funding terrorists.  \n\nIf you were to try and cut off the saudi's what happens? Everyone named prince ________ loses his head and Saudi becomes Daesh 2.0 with millions of barrels of oil to sell and a giant pile of money?  Would they become more moderate and sensible?  Hard to know.  Sanctions rarely make unreasonable people into reasonable ones.  \n\nSaudi arabia is a complicated country, perhaps too complicated for this specific ELI5, but it is a monarchy perched on a complex mesh of religious various factional divisions and rules (Saudi arabia is the merger of the kingdom of Hejaz which was conquered by the sultanate of Nejd - in 1925), add to that oil money and the massive influx of foreign workers to run half the country and you have a complicated and unique mess.  The leadership of the House of Saud want to be friends with the US (they really genuinely honestly do), it benefits them for many reasons not the least of which are money and security if they are deposed.  But the government structure of saudi, the vast amounts of wealth, and you have a group of idle people who are a powder keg.  The saudi's are happy they run off and be terrorists, because hopefully they get killed in the process, and don't start anything back home.  Because if they start something back home there might not be any way to contain it without american help.\n\nAnd the Americans (and europeans) want oil.. which the saudi's have, and the other main option is Russia.  Saudi is regionally strong, but it's a desert of 35 million people, internationally it is very weak.  Russia is big, historically, strong, and has ambitions beyond her own borders.  Who would you rather depend on for the fuel for your car?  \n"},

They (the Tarahumara) might genetically be better runners.\n\nI guess long-distance running was a more important skill to have for many Eastern African tribes compared to Indigenous Bolivians tribes.

Once the resulting product comes out of the furnace, how is the strength then judged to figure out whether it can be used for somthing like food cans or structural parts of a bridge?","answer":"Thanks for the answer. Does that mean in theory as recycled metal is recycled again and again, eventually the quality of the end product falls?  Presumably this could be avoided by adding higher amounts of pure compounds as you say.  But in many years the end product becomes so low quality that it can't be used for heavy duty stuff like bridges.\n\nI guess by this stage we'd have other stuff to worry about.

That's exactly the kind of politician I want, whether they agree with me or not, but it seems like it's an easy target for people to criticize.

[Our brains are wired to reinforced our own opinions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias), especially after a particular age.

{"title":"ELI5: what would happen if a nuclear attack on America actually took place?","question_detail":"What are the after effects? Assuming it took place on DC what would the east coat experience? The mid west? West coast?","answer":"If you're talking *today,* and some terrorist entity attacking with one small bomb, worst case scenario they'd probably level a major city, kill a few hundred thousand people and cost a few tens of billions in damage. Not a good day, but not the end of the world.\n\nIf it was determined that the bomb was obtained from somebody we didn't like, we would almost certainly retaliate with nukes against the country that let the bomb slip out of their hands.\n\nIf you're talking the Cold War days, then the end of the world would have happened.\n\nFrom the dawn of the nuclear weapons age to at least the early 2000s, the US nuclear response plan was laid out in the Pentagon's Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP), which was basically their one and only plan for waging nuclear war. This charming document, which existed from the late 50s all the way up to the 21st century, had one simple response to the confirmed launch of even a single Russian nuke: LUDICROUS retaliation.\n\nAt the time of Jimmy Carter's presidency (the last one I have definite figures for), it called for a retaliation strike of some TEN THOUSAND NUCLEAR WEAPONS to be launched at Russia and other targets, all within a span of a few hours. And the President might have all of three minutes to decide on this, after having been waken up at two in the morning. All the talk we heard about \"limited exchanges\" and \"cooling-off periods\" were just talk. The Pentagon had ONE nuke plan, and that was it.\n\nSuch an event would have triggered nuclear winter and almost certainly ended all human life on Earth.\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: What is GPU clock","answer":"GPU clock is the rate at which the GPU does things. Typically in the range of a hundrets MHz up to one GHz. One MHz means your GPU can do a certain set of things one billion (10^9) times a second. What kind of things are done depends on the type of GPU. More clock is generally better, but there can be processors that do the same amount of work with less clock because they do more things in parallel or are more efficient at certain calculations. "},

{"title":"ELI5: What makes Messi and Ronaldo so much better than other elite footballers?","answer":"This is a great article explaining why Messi is so good. \n\nhttp://fivethirtyeight.com/features/lionel-messi-is-impossible/\n\nA summary;\nMessi is the best dribbler in the world, the best passer in the world, the best chance creator for his teammates in the world, one of the most accurate shooters from inside the penalty area in the world, one of the most accurate shooters from outside the penalty area in the world, one of the most accurate shooters with his weaker foot etc. The list goes on. All of this combined in one player makes him the ultimate footballer and why is already talked about as the greatest of all time. \n\nRonaldo is slightly different. He used to be a much more explosive player and a better dribbler in his Manchester United and early Real Madrid days but now (partly due to his knee issues) he dribbles with the ball a lot less and focuses his efforts more on goal scoring. The result however is that he has basically become the perfect goal scoring machine. His positional movement is outstanding and defenders cannot keep up with him. He is nearly always in the right position to score. His detractors criticise him for scoring mostly tap ins lately in the last few years but that's because he is always where he needs to be. \n\nMessi and Ronaldo are a level above all other players but another factor is that Real Madrid and Barca are also stacked with world class players and it wouldn't be hard to argue that each of their players is one of the best in their position in the world. Because of this it means that Madrid and Barca have a massive advantage over their rivals and it allows Messi and Ronaldo to perform even better"},
{"title":"ELI5: 1st world countries are USA, UK, France etc. 3rd world countries are China, Indonesia, Thailand etc. Where are 2nd world countries??","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"1st and 3rd world countries has taken on a different meaning since second world was in use. 1st world countries originally meant the capitalist anti communist alliance of the world, while second world meant communist and communist allied countries. 3rd world countries were unaffiliated with either. This usage kind of ended after the cold war, and now it's more like 1st world = developed 3rd world = undeveloped, and second world is just doesn't really have an updated use. So a country like China used to be second world, now it would be considered 1st or 3rd world depending on who you ask. While a country like Thailand would be considered first world with the original meaning, it is now considered more 3rd world as the meaning changed over time."},

Is it simply that sensitive to friction or is there a 'dead man switch' in the detonator itself?\n\nEDIT: This is regarding explsoives that do not have countdown timers.","answer":"To build on this:\n\nThe most basic bomb is a simple circuit that, if power goes through it, explodes. Cut the wire, and it can't explode.\n\nFancier bombs use many wires, and a circuit board. Some wires have power going through them, some don't. If anything changes, the circuit board sends power to the bomb, and boom. In a setup like this, the goal is to cut the wire that connects whatever device the bombmaker is going to signal to the circuit board; or the wire that connects the circuit board to the bomb itself.\n\n\nRealistically though, most bomb squads don't bother trying to defuse the bomb: for most bombs, you want to contain it (with a blast blanket or other blast-resistant cover); and then blow it up in a way that nobody gets hurt."},

Or, if you prefer, imagine that you are designing a fancy bridge and want to calculate what places have the most stress and the maximum weight it will support.  \n \nOne way to solve problems like this (and many others) is to subdivide the metal/bridge into very small pieces, usually using a computer program to do it. For example, divide it into tiny cubes. Then you can calculate the stress (or whatever) on each little cube with simple equations that account for the stress transmitted to it from the outside world and/or its six neighboring cubes.  The equations all need to match up...it isn't kosher to have different values between the sides of two cubes that are touching.   \n \nYou can also incorporate time into all of the equations, which makes the math more complex.  But you're using a computer program, so once you know the equations that have to be solved and set it up to run for all of the cubes and get answers that line up, what do you care if it takes millions (or more) calculations?  It's just computer time.   You can tell the program to estimate what will happen at one second intervals, or one nanosecond, or whatever you choose.  The finer the granularity in space and time, the more accurate your simulation is likely to be, but the more computing resources it will take up. \n \n"},

{"title":"ELI5:Abortions","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"I'm not going to use a throwaway because, though I'm not proud, my experience has become a part of me.\n\nA lot of the stuff you hear is propaganda, though there is some truth to it. In most states where it's legal to have an abortion, the cutoff date is somewhere  before the third trimester because at that point, the baby can have a heartbeat, have facial expressions, feel things physically, etc. It's a fine line of morality. But, before that stage, though it may technically be a human, things are different. Technically it is just a clump, but we don't REALLY have a way of knowing how this tiny creature feels or experiences anything....\n\nMy experience, no matter how heartbreaking, was positive. Virtually no pain, mostly discomfort. The staff was very sympathetic and accommodating. They gave me an education on the benefits/risks of having a child vs abortion, I had to meet with a counselor a few days before to talk about my situation and make sure I wanted to go through with it. They pushed me to go through with the pregnancy and they pushed toward adoption as an alternative. Very caring people who absolutely respect life...\nI was in a terrifying position and there was no way I would have been able to provide for this kid,  and my SO didn't want to participate, so I felt that this was my only option besides adoption. I can't explain what my thoughts were, only that I was very young and scared. \n\nAs far as the procedure went....it was virtually painless, though nerve wracking and absolutely fucking terrifying. The staff was very caring and supportive. It's a minimally invasive procedure and not even close to as bad as anyone would expect. It was extremely clean, and a very somber deal.....all the horrible stuff you hear is just not true.\n\nAs far as the procedure is performed......\nA clamp is used to spread your vagina enough to reach the cervix. After your cervix has been dilated, an anesthetic is injected. The doctor then uses some kind of medical device (honestly not sure because I was pretty gone and stressed) to grab the tissue and...do his thing. I'm sorry. I can't go into the actual real detail because it varies and I was pretty far gone at that point...basically, anything that is attached is unattached, and then the doctor uses an industrial vacuum.... The pain is minimal, kind of like bad period cramps. Both the patient and staff hear and see nothing. The entire procedure took about 10 minutes, after 2 days and 8 hours of waiting.......in my opinion it just comes down to morality. Technically, its a baby at any time.  But after a point, it becomes an actual human, and not just a thing that is trying to develop into a human.\n\nI would never do it again.\n\n\n Today, actually, is when I went through with it. It's been 4 years....I'll always wonder how it would have been. Magnus, I love you. \n"},

","answer":"The basic idea is that the highly specific laws you are talking about tend not to apply to every day life. They apply to specific activities that people have a chance to research learn about. \n\nSo, to take your example, when you are going to move, you are probably going to talk to DPS about shutting off your utilities anyway, and you are likely working with an agent or talking to professionals who can inform you about this stuff. \n\nAnd, on top of that, most of the small stuff usually doesn't involve arrests.  We have a whole category of laws that may carry a small fine or a harsh warning but that don't empower the state to arrest you or carry any jail time.

{"title":"ELI5: What is allocative efficiency in the economy?","question_detail":"[deleted]","answer":"It's when resources are being used such that the marginal cost of producing something is equal to the marginal benefit it provides consumers.

{"title":"ELI5: Why, in a world where we're told our best will not always be enough to land our dream job, do we have endless articles written by people who can't seem to write?","question_detail":"I just find it frustrating because surely there's an endless amount of people who can write informatively and eloquently, so who's hiring all these people who are failing to do their job well?","answer":"This is going to sound random as, but... here's my take on it. Overseas Outsourcing. \n\nYep, outsourcing. And, the internet. Take a look at the websites 'odesk' and 'elance' and some other ones. Not only do Americans want to work from home, but people in Nepal do as well. And Bangladesh, and India and the Phillippines. Those people can write in English and will work for far less. \n\nArticle writing (blogosphere stuff) is a 'thing' that has recently (I think recently) been done on the cheap. On the *very* cheap. \n\nWebsites and blogs need a hell of a lot of content to stay 'current' and get those clicks. And the quality of the content is really not that important, as you have noticed. \n\nA lot of 'newspapers' and 'magazines' and blogs actually purchase their articles from the lowest bidder. The 'news' media is a collection of businesses trying to make money and cut costs. \n\nBecause of the internet, it's easy to cut costs. There are writers in places like India, Bangladesh and the Philippines who will write 10 articles for something like a dollar each. \n\nI found out about this when my friend was looking into doing freelance admin assisting work online and she saw a lot of 'ads' for article writers. She was like \"I can do this, I can write pretty well.\" \n\nBut when we looked at the 'system' for a few days, it became clear that her competition was established writers with a journalism degree and a large portfolio of work (if portfolio is the right word) and.... people in Asia who would write  'blog articles' for the equivalent of 3 dollars an hour.\n\nTLDR: outsourcing. Why pay a college educated, experienced writer 25 bucks and hour when you can pay someone in the Philippines almost a tenth of that.  They just email the article to you and bingo bango, you're done. \n\nThese writers are not as well trained and of course do not have a native grasp of the English language. They're just willing to churn out crap for cheap, and the blogosphere/internet is willing to buy it. "},
{"title":"ELI5: Relativity","answer":"The speed of time is not constant. The only things that is constant is the speed of light (in a vacuum) relative to you. If you move at half the speed of light the photons emited by your headlights will go to the speed of light relative to you, but also relative to someone who is not moving (and thus seing you go at 0.5c and the photons you emit at c).\nHow ? As you get closer from the speed of light, time slow down for you and space is compressed (relative to you) in your direction of travel making it possible for photons to go 300 000km/s (ie : light-speed) faster than you, relative to you."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why do bus costs vary so much?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"Because municipalities in southern Ontario are territorial, given that they have so little power to begin with compared to municipalities in other parts of the world.

{"title":"Eli5: why did they change many story details in Avengers: age of ultron instead of going by the comic counterparts?","question_detail":"Why wasn't Ultron built by Ant Man? Was Vision able to pick up Thor's hammer in the comics? Why did they kill quicksilver, I always thought he was Magneto's son.","answer":"&gt; Why wasn't Ultron built by Ant Man?\n\nBecause the Ant Man who built Ultron (Hank Pym) had not been introduced into any of the Marvel movies to that point. You would have to dedicate time to introducing Pym, establishing a reason he would build an AI, then introduce Ultron. Considering runtime considerations, and the fact that Iron Man/Tony Stark already fills much of that space in the Avengers story, it's easier to cut Pym our of Ultron's story, and have Stark build him instead. \n\n&gt;  Was Vision able to pick up Thor's hammer in the comics? \n\nI don't know if Vision has ever lifted Thor's hammer. However, other characters have proven worthy, including Beta Ray Bill, Thunderstrike, Storm and Captain America. Even Wonder Woman and Superman have done so in Marvel/DC crossovers. \n\nHaving others lift Thor's hammer is a very quick and convincing way to communicate to the characters and audience that Vision is a good guy. \n\n&gt; Why did they kill quicksilver, I always thought he was Magneto's son.\n\nQuicksilver is a sufficiently disposable character that they could kill him as a way of showing the danger the other Avengers were in. As for Magneto, since Marvel does not own the licence to the character on film (because they sold the rights to FOX), they cannot mention Magneto in their movies.  \n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: What is the benefit of cryptocurrency?","question_detail":"[deleted]","answer":"Freedom. Its that simple. The basic history of money is pretty straight forward for about 5000 years, up until about 150 years ago, gold and silver coins were money. That worked out pretty well. Its not a perfect system, but its a good system.\n\nThen we switched to paper money, but it was paper money backed by gold. The gold was in the vault, and the paper was a *receipt* for the gold. It was easier to swap receipts than the actual metal so that was okay...for a while.\n\nThe problems started when the people who issue the receipts started issuing more receipts than they had gold to back it up. They were writing rubber cheques. There's a word for this its called *fraud*.\n\nOver the 20th century there were a few variations on this system but they always went back to this central problem of the people who controlled the issuing of the paper money, issuing a lot more paper money than they had gold backing it up. Then in 1971 Nixon took money off gold entirely so it is just pure paper with *nothing* backing it up, and they could print as much as they wanted.\n\nThat's what they (the US government and Federal Reserve, and other national equivalents in other countries) have been doing for about 45 years now. They just keep printing more and more paper money. Or now they just type it into a computer its digital.\n\nSo that's the 1st major benefit. Bitcoin is *limited*. 21 million coins total. People do not understand that inflation is *theft*. Lets say I am the bank and I control the printing of money. Now lets say you have $100,000 saved up. Now I, the bank, decide to print a whole lot of money, so much so that it doubles the amount of money in the economy. Your $100,000? It is now worth *half* as much.\n\nThat is what inflation is inflation is *theft*! The government tends to hide this by trying to keep inflation down to 2-3% per year, but if they say 3% its probably more like 6% and at 6% inflation per year, your savings will half in value about once every 11 years. All that money you are saving for your pension? You're just pissing into the wind because the inflation termites are eating away at it.\n\nBitcoin is different you cannot just print more bitcoins it has a fixed supply, so you cannot be screwed over by central banks.\n\nThe second is control. Who owns your money? Answer: not you. The bank owns it, and you owe it back to them with interest. While you are using dollars, you are in their system, and they make the rules. They can impose any kind of controls they want. They can, for no reason, freeze your accounts. Hell they can legally *seize* your accounts. They can control how much you can leave the country with, what you spent it on, who you spend it on, whether or not you are allowed to take it out of the bank, how much you are allowed to deposit, how often. They are already taking steps to ban physical cash which means you are now 100% locked in their system with no way to circumvent it where all transactions are tracked and controlled by them. You are 100% dependent on money, we all are, and they control every aspect of it, even so far as just keeping it and telling you to piss off when you go to withdraw your life savings (yes that is now legal). They own your ass.\n\nBitcoin gives you an escape hatch. Its a way out. Bitcoin cannot be bailed out, or bailed in. There are no border controls, no KYC laws, no \"structuring\" laws (in which you are guilty until proven innocent and they are basically impossible to prove innocence), withdrawal limits, and with the most basic security it cannot be stolen or seized because there are no banks controlling it.\n\nGreece (were people could not withdraw their own money), will never happen in bitcoin. Venezuela (800% inflation) will never happen in bitcoin. Argentina (inflation and government seizures) will never happen in bitcoin. China (capital controls) will never happen in bitcoin.\n\nIts that simple. They control the system, they have a leash round your neck, and they are systematically closing any and all ways you have of getting around their system even for a minute. Except bitcoin. Bitcoin is the one system that is outside of their system *that they cannot shut down*."},

I'm in Germany so that's the one I really know about.\n\nA huge amount of videos are blocked in Germany and it says something about not being able to negotiate with GEMA for the right to show it in Germany.\n\nBut GEMA says it's trying to negotiate with Youtube, and Youtube is simply ignoring them.

Making weird sounds to lure them in so they can attack? Are they trying to tell their owner something? I can't imagine it being a useful strategy when hunting in the wild. Why would they make this noise if they're trying to sneak up on their prey? Is there really an explanation for it or are cats just weird?","answer":"It seems no-one has determined the reason yet.\nPrevailing theories are:\n\n\n* Mimicry as a lure\n* Frustration\n* Anticipation\n* Automatic response to adrenaline\n\nSources:\nhttp://www.catster.com/the-scoop/scientists-discover-new-meaning-for-cat-chattering\nhttp://www.catbehaviorassociates.com/why-do-cats-chatter/"},

Watching that makes me want to know what actually happens there. What does the wood or the spoon do or cause to have this effect?","answer":"Further to this, its slight roughness only pops the bubbles at the very top that contact it... but that's all it needs to pop in order to keep their level below the top of the pot and prevent a boilover.

{"title":"ELI5: Why doesn't everyone in Star Wars have a light saber?","question_detail":"Seems like it would be a great thing to carry with you even if you can't block laser blasts. I mean, just as a great tool for cutting stuff.  \nI mean Han used Luke's in ESB, so pretty much anyone could use it for how I'm envisioning.","answer":"The current canon is that the handle is light and the blade itself is absolutely weightless, but the plasma loop causes it to move strangely. So it's unlike any other weapon in existence in terms of how handling it works, and the multiple lightsaber styles balance the unique benefits of a nearly weightless weapon with the training to cancel out its little idiosyncrasies and the needs of fighting at the time of the style's creation.\n\nThe also have modern plasma cutters, but the technology is totally different from how lightsabers operate.

{"title":"ELI5: What's the difference between Senators, Governors and Congressmen?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"There are 50 United States. Each state has a single executive officer who is effectively the leader of that state. That person is that state's \"governor.\" A governor is like a President of a state.\n\nBoth the USA itself as well as each individual state has a legislative body that writes laws. Members of such a body are congressmen. The Federal government, as well as many states, divides the legislature into two \"chambers\". The more august one is called the Senate, and its members are called senators. So all senators are congressmen, but only some congressmen are senators.\n\nUsually when speaking of state legislatures, people will clarify \"state senator\" or \"state representative\", but they'll just say \"senator\" for the federal senate."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why don't phone CPUs throttle like laptop and desktop cpus","question_detail":"Basically as the title really. How come phones need to have low power and high power cores? An 8 core CPU constantly swapping between the cores seems more work than just having a quad core that can run from 1 to 2ghz for example","answer":"RISC processors divide up the multi-input data streams and allocate streams to different cores based on their need.  This is in part because of the lack of Microcode; Something commonly found in CISC CPU's.  Another reason, (as mentioned below from other redditors) with the Reduced Instruction Set CPU's there is a lack of complex processing ability and large cache.  Due to that limitation, the core is inefficient with multiple threads.\n\nThe up side is that each architecture step we take down in size leaves more room for another core with more transistors.  "},
{"title":"ELI5: Why is Eugenics illegal and seen as so vile?","question_detail":"[deleted]","answer":"Who sets the standards? Do we want to do it based on intelligence? Well intelligence is changeable and based of many many more factors than genetics, and biological considerations play a very small role in comparison to environmental ones, but fine let's humor it How do we test for that? Do people need to sit down and write a literal test? We've done this before in the 1920s and the results were appalling, it's very easy to produce a bad and biased test. Further intelligence is a broad skill, even designed perfectly any test would likely be kin to testing Usain Bolt's athletic ability by entering him into a powerlifting competition. \n\nIt's seen as vile because historically (and quite frankly, currently) eugenic promoters propose it based around their own biases. Quite often this takes the form of racial, sexuailty, religious or other similar qualifers, either stated outright or implicitly. Further, supporters have generally constructed outcomes that fit those basis; the National Intelligence Test for example was designed to be incredibly americocentric containing questions like \"Velvet Joe appears in advertisements of ... (tooth powder)(dry goods)(tobacco)(soap).\" . Someone living in the USA for several years would score quite well, a new immigrant would score poorly and this test was used to justify immigration restrictions based on certain groups being unfit (particular southern  and eastern europeans).  \n\nTo compound all that, there is not one iota of good evidence that eugenics has any actual chance at impacting human race in any meaningful way. \n"},

{"title":"ELI5: What is 'rape' culture? Does our society actually encourage or condone rape?","question_detail":"[deleted]","answer":"Let's start with the male side of rape culture to show how it's not just some crazy sjw idea.\n\nThere are many people today who don't believe men can be raped by a woman. There a jokes about prison rape, there are people wishing rape upon some criminals. We don't have proper systems in place, formally or socially, to help men who have been raped.\n\nOn the female side of rape, women can be told it was their fault for being raped because of what they were wearing. There are some ideologies that promote men being persistent and this persistence can come across as a threat when alone. I'm not going to say that having sex with a tipsy person is rape but I don't think it's great that there are events aimed at getting women to drink more so that they are more likely to have sex.\n\nFor both genders being raped can make others see them as \"unclean\" in a way that assault or theft doesn't."},

To begin singing high whistle-like overtones, the sides of the tongue are curved upward and held nearly against the upper premolar teeth - creating a seal with the roof of the mouth all the way around (with a small opening for air to pass).

Here the warheads will land and data can be taken from their impacts.

Consider the fact that the bulk of space taken up by any given chip is the plastic package it comes in.

{"title":"ELI5: How do you get an auto loan or financing? And what are the typical minimum requirements.","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"In the U.S. you apply for it at a credit union, bank, or at a dealership. Shopping around yourself is the way to find the best deal, but your dealership may do that for you. That's hit or miss though - some may only give loans based on their finance company. The last car i bought from a used car only dealer, and they said I could get a better rate than what they could offer if I went through a particular credit union, and facilitated getting me a membership there ($5 deposit needed) and even got me the load forms to fill out. I thought that was pretty cool on their part.\n\nLoan eligibility for something like a car is usually based on your credit history and a proven ability to pay back the loan (a job and not too much other debt). Most people can get one, because it is secured with the vehicle (if you don't pay them back they can repo your car), but those other factors will affect who will give you one and what the interest rate will be."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why do our lips stick together when they are dry?","question_detail":"It feels like skin grows between your lips.","answer":"Because the other secretions of the lips will come into contact with each another and dry up, leaving a thin glue-like layer that you have to pull apart. \n\nUsually this is constantly diluted and cleared off by your more watery salivary glands, which also lessens friction, but if your lips are dried out by the cold, dehydration, medications or other reasons, the results is stickiness."},
{"title":"ELI5: Why is there so much focus on having rockets that can land, rather than just deploy a parachute or glider system?","question_detail":"Wouldn't this be far simpler, easier, less expensive, use less fuel, etc compared to trying to use rockets to land vertically?","answer":"They did this with the Shuttle's booster rockets, so obviously it's possible.  The problem is even with 8000 pounds of parachute the boosters were still hitting the ocean at 50 mph or so.  This worked fine for that application because while they're crude and inefficient a solid rocket is about as delicate as a sewer pipe. \n\nThe liquid rocket engines that SpaceX uses are a lot more appropriate for what they're trying to do but they generally couldn't survive being *dipped* in salt water without serious refurbishment, let alone crashing into it at freeway speeds."},

For parks like Universal and Sea World they're also avoiding additional competition with the juggernaut that Disney is.

{"title":"ELI5: why do we feel phone vibration when there is none but don't feel it when it is there.","answer":"For the first part:\n\nGenerally, when we feel some kind of \"phantom\" vibration (when we think we feel our phone vibrate, even though it doesn't), this can be attributed to something else going on in our body that we can mistake for a vibration. This could be anything from blood moving through a certain area to a sudden itch next to our phone to an accidental misfiring of nerve cells, making us think we feel something when we don't (could even be a muscle twitch). We tend to notice these feelings more when they're next to our phone in our pocket because we are aware of the phone being in our pocket, and any sensory input from that area isn't forgotten nearly as quickly as, say, a muscle twitch in an arm.\n\nIt might also be that you're expecting a text or email so much that your mind becomes convinced that your phone buzzed when it hadn't. The mind is weird that way.\n\nFor the second part:\n\nSometimes when our minds are so focused on something else (a conversation, or a movie, or something) we fail to notice other sensory input like our phone vibrating. Also, sometimes the phone gets so tangled in our pocket that we fail to notice the vibration, or sometimes the phone drifts away from our leg in our pocket, and when it vibrates it's not actually completely touching the leg at the time."},

Laptops aren't very good at dissipating heat, because the things that dissipate heat (large, high thermal capacity heat sinks and airflow with large fans and air ducts) would make them terrible laptops. \n\nThe Internet connection would create a lot of heat, and if it's an older, pre-2008 laptop, it not only has bad cooling, but also has an inefficient wireless adapter and graphic processing unit that will create more heat. \n\nAt very high temperatures (80C), the computer would start to lose coherent performance.

I know that this must differ from engine to engine but perhaps a rule of thumb to go by, and weather fuel usage is directly proportional to speed?","answer":"Your question is basically impossible to answer as it depends on so many variables that there are as many answers as there are cars.  The below is a gross simplification of the issue, so bear that in mind.  \n\nThe long, complicated answer to this question is that in general, figuring out the power needed to overcome drag is done through a complicated formula reddit won't let me paste, but the relevant portion is that in order to overcome drag the power must be cubed in relation to the velocity.  So air resistance is not linear, it's exponential.  It takes much, much more than 100 times the energy to move 1 mph than it does 100 mph.  \n\nThat said, cars have multiple gears, so the gearing of your car has a huge amount of influence on how much gas and power you're using to go 40, 60, or 100 mph.  \n\nUsing the most generic statistics available, it looks like this.  Assuming a mpg rating of 30 mpg highway Going a half mile at 40 mph you'll be getting roughly 30 mpg.  At 60 you're getting roughly 29 mpg.  Assuming a perfect 50/50 split for a mile with instant acceleration to not lose gas for that, you're getting 29.5 mpg.  On the other hand, depending on what sites you're looking at, going at 100 mph drops your efficiency between 40 and 50%.  So now, for that one mile, you're getting maybe 17 mpg.  \n\nSo, seventeen miles per gallon means in one mile you burned .06 gallons.  At 29.5 mpg you burned .03 gallons.  It's basically twice as efficient.  Since there's very little difference between the two mileages at 40 and 60, driving one mile of each uses roughly as much fuel as driving one mile of 100.  "},

{"title":"ELI5: Why does cancer affect some people but not others?","question_detail":"Cancer is mysterious to me. Why do some people in life get cancer but others don't? How can a smoker who smoke a pack a day live to age 80 without cancer but a child get leukemia at age 5? Some women get breast cancer and others don't? Some men get prostate cancer but others don't? The list goes on. I really don't understand why.","answer":"Cancer is actually several different diseases each with several initiation steps that must happen for cancer to arise.\n\nAll cancers are essentially just some form of rapid uncontrolled cell division. A cell is the basic unit that makes up your body and cell division is how your body repairs and maintains itself, basically by copying one cell in to two. This division is regulated by several things, which I'll explain in a minute.\n\nCells contain DNA which is made up of long sequences of bases, some clusters of DNA are called genes and are expressed as other things like proteins. Some parts of your cells are able to go in to the DNA and copy a gene, take it to other parts of the cell where the copied DNA is made in to functional stuff like insulin. One of the important proteins made from your DNA is p53, a tumour suppressing gene that recognises broken or severely mutated DNA, if it does recognise this broken DNA, it kills the cell to stop it reproducing. If the broken DNA is the bit that has the information to make the p53 protein, well, you have no way to recognise broken DNA.\n\nDNA undergoes many mutations which are completely random, it is made up of 4 bases represented as A, T, C and G in text. A piece of DNA might look like this AATCGGTGACCT, but DNA is double stranded and there are specific base pairing rules. A pairs with T and C pairs with G, so the strand that attaches to the one above would be TTAGCCACTGGA. These pairs are caused by the shape of the bases being complementary to each other, allowing hydrogen bonds to form between them easily.\n\nDNA is huge though, so there will always be some mistakes, you might get A pairing with A which will weaken the molecule. It's usually not a big deal but...\n\nSome DNA is coding DNA. That means it is used to make things like the aforementioned p53 protein. If a mistake (mutation) occurs in one of these coding regions, bad things can happen. Not always, but sometimes. The DNA code is based on codons, a series of 3 bases in sequence such as AAA that are associated with one amino acid. For instance, AAA GGG CCC TTT would code for 4 amino acids, because 3 bases produce 1 amino acid. The DNA code is degenerative in that you can swap out some bases and still get the same amino acids, some amino acids even come out the same no matter what the last base in the triplet is. Proline for instance will always be produced if the first 2 bases in a triplet are CC, so CCA, CCT, CCC and CCG will all produce the same amino acid. [Here's a chart](http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/genetic-code.jpg) if you're interested. Ignore the U, I've used T for simplicity's sake, the explanation would be twice as long if I went in to the whole U thing.\n\nIt's apparent then that a mutation on the 3rd base after CC will basically be irrelevant. But what if you mutate the first base? Well, in some cases that will completely deform the protein, but in the majority it won't. A lot of amino acids can be swapped out as long as they're not on important twist regions of the protein and are generally the same size and charge. The protein, i.e. p53 will still function with this kind of mutation.\n\nBut what if we put an extra base in? AAA CCC GGG TTT AAA becomes AAT ACC CGG GTT TAA, a completely different sequence. Insertions and deletions are extremely dangerous because they can completely change the entire protein in one go, there's no \"swapping out\" an amino acid, the entire thing becomes nonsense.\n\nThe whole point of mutations is that they're random. A person could experience 1,000,000 mutations and get a frameshift mutation on the p53 gene that causes the p53 protein to become inactive, then he will not have a suppressing mechanism in the affected cell or any cells that cell goes on to produce. Conversely, a person could experience 1,000,000,000,000,000 mutations and never get a frameshift mutation on the p53 gene and his p53 protein will be completely functional for life.\n\nWith the p53 protein inactive, if any of the non-p53 producing cells become cancerous the body has no way to stop them reproducing. There are many ways for a cell to become cancerous and it's usually a result of mutation, similar to what I described above but on a different section of the DNA. Again, the DNA code is huge and a lot of it is called \"junk\" (although we're beginning to think that some junk DNA affects expressed DNA, but we're not sure how just yet) and mutations there won't directly cause cancer.\n\nThe important thing to take away, I suppose this is a tldr, is that mutations cause cancer and mutations are entirely random. Smoking, obesity, stress and all that other bad stuff cause more mutations, but it's like buying more lottery tickets, it doesn't mean you're going to \"win\" cancer. It just means that the chance is much higher."},

{"title":"ELI5: What does an Art Director do exactly?","question_detail":"a day in the life / realistic job description would be awesome, salary advancement history also appreciated","answer":"Not sure if there are differences for movies compared to games, but in game development, an art director is there to make sure all artists create coherent artwork.\n\nThere's a problem in game design that a single person cannot create all the artwork for a game. Suppose 1 person makes 100 3D modeled characters. By the time he's doing the 100th, the technology will have improved, art standards have increased, and the first one will look severely outdated compared to the others.  \nNot only because that person will be more experienced after creating 99 3D models, but also because maybe the technical limitation on games has been increased (e.g. a move from 720p to 1080p, requiring more detailed artwork and textures). This causes that person to get stuck in an infinite loop of having to redo the oldest content, but never being able to catch up.\n\nSolution: Have many people create the art in a short timespan. This way, the technology doesn't improve noticeably and all character models are of an equivalent level of detail.\n\nBut a new problem emerges. Artist 1 like using real life proportions, while Artist 2 prefers Borderlands' cartoony traits. Artist 3 is a huge fan of weapons and puts lots of intricate details in them, but Artist 4 thinks weapons are irrelevant for a point and click game and doesn't flesh them out much.\n\nAn art director is there to guide the artists so that the art direction is coherent across all artists' works. While it's important for some things to exude different characteristics, it's also important that the assets don't look like they've been plucked from completely different games or environments."},

{"title":"ELI5: How does reddit allow a sub like /r/CuteFemaleCorpses but banned r/thefappening?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"Despite what most people seem to think, Reddit--and companies like Reddit--do not have an active opinion on content that is posted to their website. Why? Well, there are 2 main factors at play:\n\nFirst, it would be too costly to **proactively** censor content on a website that allows anyone to create a subreddit for any type of content that can be added without approval. For this reason, companies rely on feedback to be alerted to things that may be a violation of their terms of service. This gets into the second point...\n\nSecond, company's like Reddit are not held liable for the content that their users post so long as (1) they do not curate it, and (2) they comply with legal demands from those who have a problem with content being posted. #1 falls under the first aspect discussed above. #2 has to do with the heart of your question. Like many subreddits (and without visiting this one particularly), it appears that /r/cutefemalecorpses is full of content that would be deemed offensive to some people... but it is likely that no one has brought a legal complaint based on the content, which means we fall back to the first prong which is simply that the subreddit gets lost in a sea of other subreddits and hasn't yet reached a point of requiring action from Reddit.\n\nCompare that to /r/thefappening. In that case, you had victims of targeted computer crimes + copyright violations all condensing into a single, specific subreddit... this made it pop up on Reddit's radar + Reddit was put in the legal crosshairs of those users who had an issue with the content being shared. For those reasons, it is closed down.\n\nThe same is true for /r/fatpeoplehate. What began as a generalized, non-specific accumulation of memes and images that were offensive to some turned into a subreddit that unofficially authorized/supported targeting of **specific** individuals. This triggered those two prongs discussed above, which resulted in it being deleted.\n\ntl;dr: Reddit doesn't \"support censorship.\" Reddit obeys laws and minimizes its liability, as it should. So the second **any** subreddit becomes more of a liability than a value-add to the website, it will be shut down. Not because of morals, or ethics, or sensibilities... simply because that's how companies work online and in the real world."},

{"title":"ELI5: What is the process for how product endorsements are arranged to be on TV shows?","question_detail":"I'm curious as to how a business's desire to promote their product makes it's way to becoming a product endorsement on a television show.  Do advertising agencies get in contact with content producers?  Are show writers given a product and told to \"fit this into their next episode\" or something? Either a general explanation of the process and/or specific examples would be appreciated.","answer":"There are sales people on TV side and media planners on the buying side (companies, media agencies, depending on setup). Each account manager on the TV side has certain customers that he keeps in touch with and makes sure everything is going smoothly. There is usually also a 'new business development' department (or person, or part of one person's responsibilities; depending on size of the operation) who is in charge of bringing in new clients.\n\nThe project itself can come about in two ways. The TV side has so-called 'upfronts', where they present their programming plans for the future period to the buyers, media etc., so the media planner can know what sort of programming to expect. If there is a tech-heavy show in the pipeline, he will call the account handler and say something like 'I like the new IT-guy-saves-the-world show, I'd like for it to feature MyPhones'. Depending on the expected success of the show, network size, viewership etc. they will come to an agreement on details like pricing etc.\n\nThe other way around is that the media planner has a new product/marketing initiative coming up and calls his account handler and says 'Look, I've got this new product coming up called MyPhone, this is what it's about, I'd like to feature it in a sitcom, how about X?' or just 'anything suitable comes to mind?'. From there on, it's pretty much the same.\n\nWhat you need to understand is that the big media agencies and the big TV networks manage a huge amount of projects and inventory. For some product launches that are very big, you go into a great deal of detail of which network at which time for which spot etc. For most things, it's agreed more on the level of 'I need 500 000 women between 19-28 in SoCal to see this ad in the next month, and I'm willing to pay $0.10 per person for it\" and the AH comes back with \"I can't go below $0.15, but I'll throw in a product placement in an episode of ThatShow that hits the same demo\".

{"title":"ELI5: Why do we usually still feel sleepy even after having enough rest?","answer":"So I read this in a science magazine many many years ago so don't quote me on this. \n\nPeople tend to feel groggy in the mornings or (usually) after a nap because their sleep was interrupted in the middle of a sleep cycle.\n\nI think normal sleep cycle goes from: \n\n1. Light sleep \n2. (Other Sleep)\n3. Deep sleep\n4. REM Sleep\n5. Light Sleep\n\nIf you are woken up at any stage other than the light sleep stage, you will feel groggy when you wake up.\n\nI have a theory as to why the groggy feeling occurs. You are awake because a bunch of chemicals in your brain (called neurotransmitters) are sent all around your brain. You get sleepy, and fall asleep when another chemical (pretty sure it's melatonin) is pumped out which causes the \"arousal\" (har-har) neurotransmitters to stop being pumped out which causes you to get tired, and then sleep when the right conditions are met. \n\nNow, sleep cycles don't happen for no reason. I'm no sleep specialist, but my guess is that the sleep cycle is caused by a difference in neurotransmitter levels in your brain. Meaning that if you're in light sleep, there are more arousal neurotransmitters than if in deep sleep for example. So if you are woken up from deep sleep, you may be awake, but not all the arousal neurones in your brain are ready to pump out arousal neurotransmitters to actually make you alert and truly \"awake\".\n\nHistamine is a neurotransmitter for arousal and other things, and I have noticed that if I use non-selective anti-histamines (allergy pills) to fall asleep (jet lag or whatever), I will wake up feeling extra groggy.\n\nI hope a specialist in the field could expand, and probably correct me on anything I may have gotten wrong, but I think my explanation isn't too far from the truth.\n\nSource: Doing a Masters in Biomedical Research with vague notions in neuroscience from undergrad."},

In my impression of post-industrial-era America, you had blue-collar, minimally educated people that worked on assembly lines, and you had \"smarter\" (in practice probably just more invested or better educated) white-collar workers that told them what to do.\n\nNow, we're gradually replacing many (most?) of the things those blue-collar workers did by automation. I can see that this creates *some* jobs - there's got to be an engineer to design it, a software guy to program it, a lawyer to get it patented, and so on - but those are more college-educated white-collar jobs, so you're losing blue-collar jobs. If it's some kind of robot, there's got to be a person that puts it together, but that's increasingly done overseas.\n\nIt's not bad to create more higher-paying jobs, but not everyone has college as an option, whether it's financial constraints or personal limitations. If we're *trading* blue-collar jobs for white-collar jobs, what about people that were already working to their capacity? In other words, if McDonald's replaces cashiers with touch screens, those cashiers aren't magically going to be smart/educated enough to become IT people. So a store doing that creates an opportunity for one un/under-employed tech person, but loses many entry-level unskilled labor positions. And okay, sure, as of today they'd be best served to go learn a trade, but surely it doesn't take as many tradesmen to keep a machine running as the people it replaced, or else there's be no benefit to automation. If the demand for tradesmen grows by X every time a machine is added, but it puts X+1 people out of work, that's not a system that works indefinitely.\n\nTL;DR: If a machine can do the work of 10 people, but it takes 10 people to run, automation isn't cheaper, especially if those people have to be *more* skilled. So for automation to be a 'good' thing from a business standpoint, somebody's losing their job, and it's probably the least skilled workers, right?","answer":"&gt; We are moving towards a world where 100% employment may not be possible, and somehow the world will have to figure out how to support a surplus workforce.\n\nThis is actually the line of thinking that got me questioning this. I'm a hiring manager for entry level positions that don't require a degree, and training is provided. I'm basically just looking for people that can speak and understand English and have some basic computer skills - if you took a typing class in high school that's probably enough. It's a good job that pays above minimum wage, but literally 1% of the applicants I get are qualified for it. The rest, I have trouble even knowing what they could do for a living. Since time immemorial they could've done manual labor, and in the more recent past they could've made a living on a factory floor, but now even a lot of manual labor requires specialized training (you can't just walk onto a construction site and get a job running a track hoe) and my impression is that the number of manufacturing jobs for unskilled workers is down significantly from ~50 years ago.\n\nIf you're young and strong enough, you could go stand in front of Home Depot and be a day laborer, I guess, but I doubt you'd make a living wage at it, and that's not really an option for a lot of people. Many of these applicants list food service or retail jobs in their previous experience, but a lot of people are insistent that those aren't meant to be living wage positions, either. So I literally don't know what these people could do to make the ~$10-$11/hr a single adult needs to survive, let alone support a family. If they can't meet our job requirements I doubt they'd be able to hack it in trade school, either.\n\nI'm generally a pretty laissez-faire kind of guy when it comes to economics, but it seems to me we're approaching a place like you described, where we may just not have jobs that these people can do and make enough money to support themselves."},

{"title":"ELI5: in the case of inbreeding, can the 'damage' genetically be corrected or lessened if breeding then occurs for generations outside of the family tree?","answer":"Generally yes. The solution you refer to has to do with gene pools, probability, and finally luck.\n\nInbreeding for a few generation begins the process of homozygosity. Instead of inheriting different genes from each parent you begin to inherit the same gene because you have the same ancestor. There are laboratory animals who are totally homozygous. They have been inbred for many generations. The advantage is that each individual will react the same way in an experiment.\n\nDuring the first generations lethal recessives were weeded out. That is the damage you are referring to.\n\nClosely inbred strains of crops exhibit hybrid vigor when crossed. Their seeds sprout into vigorous plants. This is what happens sort of with out breeding of inbred humans."},

{"title":"ELI5: how does an embryo in an egg (such as a bird/reptile/fish etc) get its oxygen?","answer":"&gt; At the same time, the pressure of oxygen is much higher outside of the egg than it is inside of the egg. This causes oxygen to flow into the egg. \n\n\n-\n\n\nIt's not a pressure differential causing actual fluid flow of oxygen.  The oxygen simply dissolves into the egg, and the oxygen molecules then move around by diffusion (essentially, a so-called \"random walk\").  The diffusion process evens out concentration differences, so that if a cell in the embryo uses up the oxygen in its immediate vicinity, then oxygen molecules will \"walk\" (diffuse) into the oxygen-depleted region, providing for additional oxygen to be used by the cell. \n\n\n-\n\n\nETA: You may be thinking of *partial* pressure, which is just a convenient measure of concentration.

Wouldn't the odds be in the favor of those needing transplants?","answer":"In addition to the points others have made, there's a timing issue - the organs have to be harvested immediately upon death as the tissue starts to die without blood flow. So you need a healthy person to die traumatically in a way that doesn't harm the organ, confirm immediately that donation is OK, then immediately harvest. And after all that, the donor and recipient have to be a match - you can't just put anyone's organ in someone else.  You can do a kidney transplant from a live donor, but people still die without a transplant because they can't find a person with the right genetic match (even siblings sometimes aren't a match)."},

{"title":"ELI5: When game developers talk about optimizing a game, what exactly does that entail?","answer":"Making the game need as little computing power/resources as possible at any set of, well, settings, essentially.\n\nOn one hand, it's not loading things that the game doesn't need currently (and conversely making it load things it does need smoothly so you don't have to wait) like textures exclusively for a final level when you're playing the tutorial, not simulating things that don't need simulating (for example, the AI for dead enemies doesn't need to trigger), scaling down detail where you wouldn't see it (for example, no need to process a full photorealistic textured body model when it's just a black-ish blotch in the distance) and the like.\n\nOn the other, it's making sure the *code itself* works efficiently, for example, when you want the code to identify if something is a chair, instead of checking the object's name and seeing if it has \"chair\" in its name, which requires comparing text strings, you add a variable ischair = 1, and check if the value of ischair equals one or not, which is a much faster operation since computers prefer simple math over text operations."},

{"title":"ELI5: how is the distance of a star or black hole measured.","answer":"Triangulation (a.k.a. parallax) (for bodies within ~500ish light years from earth)\n\n&gt;The Earth's orbit around the sun has a diameter of about 186 million miles (300 million kilometers). By looking at a star one day and then looking at it again 6 months later, an astronomer can see a difference in the viewing angle for the star. With a little trigonometry, the different angles yield a distance. \n\nBrightness measurements (over 650 light years) \n&gt;Star's color spectrum is a good indication of its actual brightness. The relationship between color and brightness was proven using the several thousand stars close enough to earth to have their distances measured directly. Astronomers can therefore look at a distant star and determine its color spectrum and redshift to accurately determine the distance.\n"},

{"title":"Eli5:The American presidential election system?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"You are not from here, are you? The US consists of fifty states. They united long ago, first as a confederation of states, later a constitution was written to produce the United States of America known today. You can look up the first four presidents and stump people. George Washington was not the first president of the United States.\n\nThe States gave up enough power to make a strong national government but retained the notion of independency. Each state in its own fashion selects who they want for president.  There are two large political parties. If one does not win the election for an office almost always the other one does.\n\nSo now there is a series of contests in each state to select delegates to national conventions of the two parties to choose each party's candidate for president.\n\nThe delegates from each state are committed to one candidate. The two parties hold separate conventions. A candidate can show up at the national convention with enough committed delegates to be assured of the nomination. This was not always true in the past.\n\nThe conventions select their candidates for president, so their are two big candidates. There is a host of small ones too.\n\nThese two candidates continue to campaign until the general election in November.\n\nThere is an electoral college system which has changed some since it was conceived. It is a system devised for state's to choose who they wanted as President and Vice President. Nowadays the Presidential candidates have chosen their Vice President and the Electoral College candidates.\n\nEach state still chooses individually who they want to be president. Most follow the principle of having all their vote go for one candidate or the other. So the contenders win states. Enough of the more popular states and a candidate can be assured they will be elected by the Electoral College.\n\nIt is not really fair or representative of the general vote but it will select a President every four years."},
{"title":"ELI5: What makes some materials conductive?","question_detail":"Could someone please explain to me why some materials conduct electricity and some don't (or not as well)?\n\nEdit: Thank you! Those responses explain it really well!","answer":"Basically, materials that don't have strongly bound outer electrons form a \"conduction band\" in their materials - a \"sea of electrons\" made from delocalized charges... electrons that don't belong to any one particular atom, but rather float around enough to neutralize the positive charges of the nuclei.\n\nThis sea acts in many of the same ways we'd expect - namely that, if you shove a bunch of electrons in one side, waves form, and electrons spill out the opposite side - i.e. Electricity will flow through these materials.\n\nConversely, if the electrons are tightly held onto there's no way to transmit electrical energy from one end of a substance to another, and electrons can't jump from one atom to another easily (aside from any regular bonding). These materials are insulators - they stop electrical flow."},

{"title":"ELI5: If eyewitness testimony is so unreliable, why is it so heavily relied upon in our courts of law?","answer":"Lots of evidence can be misleading or ambiguous. An eyewitness that there was a 6' tall dude with blood on him plus finger prints that link the person to the scene plus bank records that show purchasing a gun can be enough. But jury's should be convicting on \"i saw that person I've never seen before walk out of the store\" alone. Unfortunately sometimes they do.\n\nAs for whynit is used? Because the prosecution is trying to make the strongest case they can cobble together. So they'll use some circumstancial evidence, some partial fimger prints some eye witnesses and see if it is enough to stick.\n\nEdit: but yes, in a pwrfect world they would have to be transparent and tell the jury \"you should take this with a grain of salt.\" We don't quite live in that world yet so it is up to defense attorney's to convince them."},
{"title":"ELI5: Why does power typically flicker before it goes out?","question_detail":"We're getting slammed with a storm right now, and the power has gone out twice, each time for about 30 minutes to an hour. Why does it flicker on and off, then shut down for an extended period of time?\n\nI assume a tree or limb fell on a line somewhere, why would it not just \"PEW\" and be out for good? What causes it to battle itself from going out?","answer":"Adding this as an addition rather than a separate answer, because yours is (AFAIK) the primary reason\n\nSometimes, if the failure is due to an overload on the system (not enough power), the \"flicker\" is because the first \"drop\" is long enough to turn *some* devices off, but others can handle a short interruption. This can cause a drop, slight recovery as some devices turn off, then a second drop as the system actually fails properly"},

{"title":"ELI5: How does NASA's new laser propulsion thingy work and how fast does it travel?","answer":"It isn't new, but basically light has an impact force when it hits things, so if you have a big enough \"sail\" and a powerful enough light you can push things around in space.  Now, the main complaint is that you have to produce a *lot* of light so the propulsion thingy would require the largest lasers ever made, powered by more power than has ever been produced for that sort of thing, over a long period of time.  The main advantage, however, is that all that massive stuff can be stationed here on Earth or in near Earth orbit.  The biggest problem with accelerating a spaceship is that not only do you have to push the mass of the spaceship, but you also have to push the mass of all the fuel the spaceship is carrying to push the spaceship in the first place.  If the spaceship is getting its push from Earth-based lasers, the spaceship can be a lot lighter, which Newton says means that it will be accelerated a lot more by the same level of push.  Since the spaceship doesn't have to carry fuel, the lasers can push the whole time, meaning constant acceleration (as opposed to getting a big push at the beginning and coasting the rest of the way), meaning in theory you can get up to a non-trivial fraction of the speed of light by the time you arrive.  Then you have to aerobrake or use some fancy orbital tricks to slow down.  You can't use this method to get back unless you build lasers at your destination."},

In this instance, the cameras are all placed on the same side of the set so that no camera will be in the way of any other camera whole they're filming the set.

{"title":"ELI5: At a higher level, how do people differentiate between good dancing and bad dancing? Isn't it just moving in time to music?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"I mean, there's a bunch of things you can look for. Shape beauty is a big one -- sure, you might have your feet in the right places, but does it look natural? If it looks natural, does it look *good* on top of that? \n\n\nMy experience is in ballroom dancing, where one of the major differentiating aspects between the top professionals and, say, the top amateurs is precisely this. The top professionals (if you're interested, check out [this jive by Riccardo and Yulia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MF1REzg7GQ), the world Latin champions) can do really incredible, really difficult things with such an air of ease. Everything they do looks smooth, and natural. Compare this to [Neil and Katya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2JLS1ArPKs), who were still finalists in the world championship, but are nevertheless a cut below. Neil and Katya don't have the same elegance, their movements seem more forced. Here are [Riccardo and Yulia dancing the jive at the same competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iO_nr9b_Ag), for a better comparison. Where Riccardo and Yulia just have this seemingly endless fountain of fluid energy, Neil and Katya stutter.\n\n\nI can't talk so much about other forms of dancing, but the general idea is that at a \"higher level\", what separates the top from the 2nd tier is the quality of the motion. \"Moving in time to music\" is essentially a prerequisite -- the best dancers are set apart not by their timing, but by their artistry."},

For example, before a program is allowed to access your hard drive at all, shouldnt it have to ask you the first time? Before a browser plugin acts on other plugins to change how they work, shouldnt it have to ask you the first time? And if we later change our minds, shouldnt we be able to uninstall all the effects of those bad programs? Why do computers do things we dont want them to do and worse, then refuse to go back to the way things were?","answer":"&gt; The amount of info in a computer never exceeds the amount put in\n\nThis is true, but the amount of info put into a computer is staggeringly huge, if we include things like interrupt timing [1] or specific mouse movements.  So for example, what a network-connected computer does depends not only on the specific bytes of data it downloads, but the exact timing of the arrival of individual packets of bytes.\n\nIf you attempt to make a perfectly rewindable system, then your effort must fail once the amount of info exceeds the storage space you have available to store it.\n\n[1] An *interrupt* is when the CPU stops what it's doing to handle some external event like keyboard, mouse, or network movement.\n"},

This includes humans.\n\n&gt;Killing and eating them has no more moral or immoral aspect to it than disassembling a computer and using the parts to fix a different one.\n\nYou are definitely allowed to have this belief, but you haven't really provided anything to support your claim. Your argument seems to be that it's not immoral to harm animals because it's not immoral.\n\n&gt;Morality is an entirely human concept. For humans, by humans. And applied only to humans. A human killing another human has a moral aspect.\n\nMorality is absolutely not a concept exclusive to humans. [Many studies have shown that many animals understand concepts of fairness and reciprocity.](https://www.ted.com/talks/frans_de_waal_do_animals_have_morals?language=en) The study around 13:30 is particularly interesting.\n\n\n&gt;A human killing an animal for food, chopping down a tree to build a shelter, moving the course of a river to power a water wheel, etc. All free of any inherent morality, or immorality.\n\nOne of these is not like the other. Can you seriously not see a moral difference in harming/slaughtering a kitten and redirecting a river?\n\n&gt;Morality applies to human beings, nothing else.\n\nAgain, you keep making this claim but have provided no argument.\n\n&gt; Everything else is quite literally just part of the scenery. Objects that are part of this world to do with what we will, or not, if you choose.\n\nSome objects in this world are able to suffer or have the conscious preference to not be killed. This includes humans and many other animals.\n\nEDIT: Spelling\n\n\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: How come one of FIFA's sponsors won't go public and tell FIFA they must move their venue from Qatar or they will remove their sponsorship? They will be branded heroes and gain worldwide attention (and very positive attention at that).","question_detail":"[deleted]","answer":"There are many possibilities.\n\n- This is very likely to offend the Qatari government. This could make trading in Qatar and allied countries very difficult.\n\n- It is likely to seriously damage their long-term relationship with FIFA. If FIFA improve their image on their own (which does seem, to some extent to be starting to slowly happen) then they are still able have a lucrative sponsorship with FIFA. But being openly defiant will mean that when FIFA do sort themselves out the dissenting company may lose out.\n\n- It may invite scrutiny into their other sponsorships, which they might not want. Pulling out of FIFA because of Qatar, great, but then someone might ask why they didn't take the same stand elsewhere. (For example: if Coca-Cola pull out of FIFA over Qatar, people might ask why they didn't pull out of IOC over the Beijing Olympics. It's a very difficult question to answer diplomatically, and it may end up reflecting cynically on them, as people may say they only pulled out for the publicity.)\n\n-  Contracts with FIFA may make them liable to be expensively prosecuted for breach of contract.\n\nIf I were being cynical I might also suggest that the CEOs of FIFA's sponsors are loath to give up box seats to the world cup final as well, but honestly I'm not sure that would carry much weight compared to the four bullet points above."},

{"title":"ELI5: How does the police prove that a piece of evidence is genuine?","question_detail":"A policeman finds drugs on you.

How would the defendant prove otherwise?\n\nWhat about the things you say that \"can and will be used against you\"? How could you possibly prove that you didn't say them?","answer":"Once the drugs are found, the police will try to preserve the chain of custody.  The officer might call their partner over an say, \"look, here are some drugs.\"  They photograph the drugs at the scene, and put them in a sealed bag, and turn them over to an evidence manager who has nothing to do with the case.\n\nThe officer and anyone else involved would testify before the court about how they witnessed you carrying what appeared to be illegal drugs, or about whatever part they played after.\n\nYou, or your lawyer, dispute it by saying \"no, you weren't\", and perhaps try to provide an alternate explanation.\n\nThe jury listens to both, and decide which they believe to be most credible.

{"title":"ELI5: If time isn't constant due to things like time dilation, how do we know the age of the universe?","question_detail":"It seems like if time isn't the same everywhere, the age of the universe that we measure from the Hubble constant won't be the same age that would be measured in a part of the universe that operates on a different time than we do. ","answer":"BEFORE anything else, I'd prefer if you respond to me in a personal message. This will be much easier there, if you don't mind. I just didn't want to have you starting to reply only to have to move it all... even if that's not difficult. Also... are you from California by chance? I too, rather obviously am more than willing, and rather excited to keep up this discussion. It's not often you can keep a civil one going like this. So again, my thanks. I look forward to your reply.\n\nAs far as the evolutionary quote, I was only trying to explain why I brought it up in the first comment.\n\n&gt; Just a small clarification. The cosmic microwave background wasn't once a theory, it was a fact predicted by a theory. When the fact was actually observed that confirmed the fact and provided evidence, and thus some confirmation, for the theory.\n\nSemantics xD\n\n&gt;  Now, regarding the age of the universe, I think that is actually a fact.\n\nTo interrupt and before commenting on the rest, there is literally zero way to prove this. The cosmic microwave background doesn't prove this either. Especially when you consider that our observable universe is doubtfully all that's out there. Especially if you consider just what the observable universe is. Many posit that the universe is much bigger, some even think it is 250 times larger than what we can observe. All it does is give credence to that age of the universe. The only way to prove how old something is would be to go back in time and witness it firsthand, I.E. being there to see it. Of course we can speculate based on information such as the CMB, or other things like how long it takes light to get to us, the universe expanding. Observing planets, solar systems, and galaxies within their respective \"time lines\" of existence (which is where the theory of star formations etc). \n\nTLDR. It cannot be fact, regardless of how much information we have on the credibility of the timeline we give it. As you said so yourself \"we can be pretty sure we know the age of the universe.\" There is nothing certain about that, even if it's VERY certain, it's not 100%. Which is why the year count has been ever changing. Albeit less in more recent years as we have refined the math to figure out just how to gauge said time.\n\n&gt; Science isn't in the business of proving much.\n\nI'd say this is half true. While it isn't in the business directly of proving things, it is in the business of understanding, which proving just happens to come with that in some cases, even if it's unintended. \n\n&gt; I think it's better than not teaching science, but I agree that inaccurate things are taught and said.\n\nI agree here, not teaching it would just be a disservice, however I really don't think it would be too difficult to get accurate information put into those books. However that's where we get into conspiracy theories about inundation and kids being taught wrong on purpose etc etc. A different topic for a different time. \n\n&gt; But, this is one of the strengths of the way science works. Science doesn't depend on individuals perpetuating knowledge accurately. Science is built on a foundation of collective knowledge, as opposed to individual knowledge.\n\nLuckily this is pretty much true for all knowledge today, especially with the internet, and vast amounts of ways to access data, and verify it. The biggest problem I see is people just DONT fact check, they don't verify, and they don't check for reliability. Though the scientific community has a special... bond of sorts with peer reviewed materials, cross experimentation etc etc to test and re-verify someone else's claims etc. It's awesome to see such a global effort put forward for truth and understanding."},

{"title":"ELI5: Saudi Arabia's alleged connection to the 9/11 attacks","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"In the 18th Century there was a sect of Islam born called Wahhabism. It's named after a cleric who died in 1792 named Wahabbi. He lived and died in the Arabian peninsula, where we now call it Saudi Arabia. \n\nWahabbi made an alliance with a local chieftain who agreed to promote and protect Wahabbi's movement. In exchange the militant sect would let the chieftain maintain power and would not fight him. They founded a local theocracy, or rule of government where the state and religious establishment were closely tied. That Chieftain's name was Mohammad bin Saud, his descendents are the House of Saud. \n\nThe seat of power was held by this alliance. The sect was very powerful, and Saud could not keep control without it. Fast forward to post WWI, and the turmoil caused by the breakup of the Ottoman Empire. The Sauds had been exiled to Kuwait, but in 1932 they returned and founded the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. From then on, the house of Saud along with its Wahhabi alliance has maintained theocratic rule of the region including Mecca, the holy seat of Islam. \n\nNow why this is important is that the Saudi government promotes and protects Wahhabism and it's clerics. A big part of the belief of Wahhabism is the idea of perpetual jihad, that the entire world should be Muslim and Muslims need to stand together against infidels. \n\nA big gain for this theology was during the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union. Muslims saw this as an attack on Islam itself. Wahhabi clerics called for jihad against the Soviets. Many Arabs left to fight for the Mujahideen, a group of jihadi fighters who fought against the Soviet invasion. One of these fighters was Osama bin Laden, himself a member of the House of Saud. \n\nEventually the Mujahideen won and ousted the Soviets after a brutal war. It was a great victory for jihad and the Wahabbi rhetoric that promoted it. The Mujahideen split during the ensuing Afghan civil war into the Taliban, who established their theocracy in Afghanistan. As well it spawned Al Queda, a group of militant Wahhabists who wanted to turn jihad against the rest of the West, especially the United States. Throughout the 90s, they carried out attacks against the US such as the Beirut Embassy bombing and the 1998 attack on the world Trade Center. \n\nNow these members of Al Queda are not all Afghan. In fact many of them were foreigners training in afghanistan, inspired to do so by the Wahhabi clerics in Saudi Arabia. \n\nEventually they attacked the WTC again on 9/11. \n\nSo the Saudi involvement here is two fold. Firstly, the ideology behind the attack is promoted and protected by the House of Saud and has been for almost 200 years. Secondly many of the people involved in the attacks were Saudi themselves, born into the ideology and religious teachings of Saudi Arabia and trained in Afghanistan. "},

Ok so maybe this is eli25","question_detail":"I would post it in ask science but I found out that most of the posts there dont get answered or are told to google it","answer":"Sodium is used to properly regulate water. Without enough sodium, the water in your body can't be used, and is flushed. If there's a large enough quantity of excess water, your body will utilize more ways of removing it. Rather than pee for 5 minutes, you'll pee for your usual 30 seconds or so while the rest comes out the back, and that'll be the norm until your sodium intake can handle the water. Don't forget though. This water is wasted. It isn't useful to the body, and no matter how much you drink it can still lead to dehydration. Drinking too much can still also lead to water intoxification."},

{"title":"ELI5 Why thin white text on a colored background turns to all the colors of the rainbow when displayed on a computer monitor","question_detail":"Like this http://imgur.com/v88zN2h","answer":"It's because of text anti-aliasing. \n\nYour display is made out of a grid of pixels, each divided into a few sub-pixels (usually a red, a green and a blue sub-pixel, though not always). Using this grid to render text would result in some jagged, choppy letters, so several tricks are used, called anti-aliasing techniques to make the text appear rounded instead of jagged.\n\nOne of the simplest is to add a few lighter gray pixels around the black pixels that form the text.. since pixels are small, this gives the impression of colour gradience, thus making the text look smoother (in fact you can see what that looks like by disabling ClearText under Windows Display settings)\n\nFurther to this, they use individual sub-pixels to achieve a similar effect... essentially breaking the text down into smaller squares.. by using colours that blend better with the background or trick the eye into thinking there's more visual information than there really is, you get both the smooth text you usually see and also the artifacts you noticed on very thin text over dark/contrasty backgrounds.\n\n\nThis is specific to LCD/OLED displays, older Cathode tube dispalys bleed light from individual \"pixels\" over adjacent pixels and appear smoother in consequence, not really needing the anti-aliasing."},

Just so we're clear and people don't think you can eat all those special brownies with no effect at all. THCA will slowly convert to THC even at room temperature, so if you have cannabis that has been sitting around drying (or fermenting) then some of the THCA will have converted to THC.\n\nAnd there are far more reasons why oral consumption is much more variable, so may in some cases do very little, such as digestion and processing by the liver occurring at different speeds in different people."},

After 16 weeks or so, the payments stop, no matter what, and then your own.\n\nIn my state, if you're fired for something you did wrong, the employer can refuse your unemployment. If you disagree, you have to go through a hearing with a judge who decides whether you should get it our not.\n\nIn my experience, the employers will often deny the initial request but then just skip the hearing, so you win by default.

{"title":"ELI5: Why do we perceive some colours as \"lighter\" than others, (e.g. yellow is \"lighter\" than blue)?","question_detail":"This is something I was wondering a while ago but couldn't really understand. It's hard to explain so forgive me if it sounds messy. \n\nIn terms of the standard 7 colours of the rainbow, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo and Violet, why, for example, is blue perceived as 'darker' than yellow?\n\nIf one imagines a spectrum that goes through the colours on the x axis, and includes the additional white/black gradient from lighter versions of these colours to darker versions on the y axis like this:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/mQ2NIpp.jpg\n\nWe can imagine that the pure 'rainbow' colours are exactly in between black and white, and so not technically lighter or darker than each other as they are equally as far away from the black and white at the top and bottom.\n\nI wondered what the 'order' would be for colours in terms of 'perceived' lightness to darkness, and found I was able to achieve this by taking the colours, converting them to grayscale, and then ordering them in terms of literal lightness and darkness (closest-to-white to closest-to-black) and the order for this is:\n\nYellow\nGreen\nBlue\nOrange\nRed\nViolet\nIndigo\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/BgmvsNz.png (illustration of this)\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/GG8VNH8.png (how the image looks converted to greyscale)\n\nSo what does that mean? How does that work? Why is Indigo dark and Yellow light? Why do the colours translate to different shades of grey when converted to greyscale? Is the darkness and lightness of colours not dictated by how close to black or white they are? Is this second 'order' of colours already a thing? If so, what is it called, and what scale or spectrum is this order based on, if any? Am I overthinking this when there's a simple answer?","answer":"jebjosh369's explanation in regard to the brightness of color, or its more noticeable capabilities, makes a better analogy than lightness does.\n\nPerceiving some colors as lighter than others is a popular misconception because all colors can be lightened depending on the intensity of the color. As a graphic artist, I can darken yellow and lighten blue to make blue appear lighter than yellow, but I cannot make it brighter than yellow without adding fluorescence."},

Does it make you read it differently?","answer":"It's simply a stylistic choice.\n\nAs for how this all started: Back before the invention of the printing press books had to be hand written. As you can imagine this took a very long time for some very skilled people. (This is an age where 95% of people couldn't even read, let alone write neatly) So books were very much a luxury item and they were heavily embellished with highly decorated covers and bindings, lots of illustrations, and decorative script. These books are known as [illuminated manuscripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminated_manuscript). \n\nDecorating the first letter or word at the start of a chapter or an important passage is simply a traditional method of decoration."},

{"title":"ELI5: why are there protocols like Axolotl, SRTP, and plenty others with intricate mechanism when it all boils down to RSA?","question_detail":"As a non-engineer, I started to get interested in cryptography a short while ago. I read about RSA and how it works, it's truly a brilliant way to encrypt communication.\n\n\nHowever, I decided to dive a bit deeper than that and stumbled upon a gazillion of derived protocols either to encrypt or to exchange keys (diffie hellman, ...). Sure, their mechanisms are documented and open sourced but it's very hard to understand why any of these were created, what problems are they trying to solve?\n\n\nI mean RSA is pretty straightforward. You exchange public keys and as long as the primes you used to create your keys are big enough, you're alright. The problem that seems to be unsolvable being the \"Man in the middle\" attack (you have to trust third parties certificates, which seems like a concession to me). Nonetheless, I keep seeing new fancy ways of doing RSA and people seems to be hyped over them ; I just wish I could understand why.\n\n\nIf any kind soul would untangle this to me I'd be most appreciative!","answer":"&gt; I thought that was the principle of third parties certificates\n\nYes, in a sense it is.

{"title":"ELI5: When cooking, why does changing the quantity of items change the time required to fully cook?","question_detail":"If I'm cooking taquitos, why is there a 4 minute difference between cooking 10 and 12 taquitos?","answer":"&gt;Microwave or conventional.\n\nIf you cook 10 things in a 1000W microwave oven, they get 100W each. In 10 minutes, that's 100W * 10(1/60h) = 17Wh of energy.\n\nIf you cook 12 things in a 1000W microwave oven, they get 83W each. In 10 minutes, that's (83W) * 10(1/60h) = 14Wh of energy. You need to increase time or power, to get the same amount of heat per thing.\n\nA conventional oven is a bit different. You'd think that if you set it to 200 °C, the food will get 200 °C. But when you put cold food in the oven, it will cool down. The more food you put in, the longer it takes to heat back up. \n\nYou could counter this with a more powerful oven. But the faster it heats up, the harder it is to keep the heat evenly distributed, plus other issues."},

{"title":"ELI5: Do most jewelry stores or do any, offer financing for engagement ring purchases?","question_detail":"I need to finally pop the question to my long time girlfriend. I waited a while so i could try and save up enough for a decent ring and for a wedding afterwards should she say yes. Well here i am years later and not much as changed. I tried searching a couple companys websites and couldnt find the answers i was looking for and i know if i go in person i will get sold on rings faster than i will get answers and there are just sooooo many possible stores to choose from.since the rule of thumb is 3× your monthly pay, id like to put $1500 down on a ring ranging from 5k-10k. Ill read everyones responses and i have so many questions but the main ones i have are: can you get a loan to buy a ring? If so how much do you have to put down? How long can the loan be? What kind of interest rate should i be expecting? What are some good companies to choose from? I figured a major company would be better like zale, sterling jewelrer, shane co etc but should i try a department store like macys or sears,  If she says no, what kind of return rate would i be looking at on my purchase? Is it like a new car where once you drive it off the lot, the value drops dramatically? I have a lot of questions about a good type of ring to get as well but since thats really subjective, ill just keep my questions to how i go about getting a loan to buy a ring.","answer":"3x monthly pay is purely a marketing message from the diamond industry.  You should spend whatever comfortably fits within your budget.\n\nYou can maximize your budget by spending online.  Signet Jewelers owns Sterling, Zales, Jared, and Kay; their average gross profit margin (i.e. diamond markup) is [37%](http://s2.q4cdn.com/912924347/files/2016AR/assets/signet-2016ar.pdf).  In contrast, Blue Nile has a gross margin of [19%](http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/NILE/1991561588x0x885919/ADF06450-1F16-4FFB-9E78-32DF7862C576/Annual_Report_2015.pdf).\n\nI bought from James Allen because they have 360 degree pictures of all of their diamonds, so you're not buying blind like at Blue Nile.  They have a 30 day return policy.  After that, a diamond ring is worse than a new car - you'd be lucky to get 50% back and that's if you're patient selling through a site like [idonowidont.com](https://www.idonowidont.com/\n).  You can either propose within that 30 day window in case you need to return it or be 100% certain that she will say yes and like the ring you've chosen.\n\nMost financing options are dependent on a credit check, so it's difficult to say what will be available to you."},

Or is it different cooling properties of liquids?","answer":"This relates to something in physics called \"specific heat\". I found this definition of specific heat:\nThe specific heat is the amount of heat per unit mass required to raise the temperature by one degree Celsius. \nBasically, it's the ability of something to hold in heat because the more heat it takes to raise something by one degree celsius the longer it will stay hot. Different things have different specific heat. Take pizza, for example. The cheese has a lower specific heat so it gets cool while the pizza sauce underneath will burn the inside of your mouth. "},

{"title":"ELI5: The Barrens General Chat","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"Well, it didn't start on all servers simultaneously, and it wasn't just Chuck Norris jokes.\n\n\nThe Barrens chat was destined to become a cesspool of toxicity, trolling and bad memes, due to the zone being the first place many players met people from the other faction for the very first time. It was a low level zone, meaning it was full of noobs asking stupid questions and not knowing what the hell to do just to get trolled by more experienced players. It was the first place you encountered PvP (Crossroads), and you'd often get ganked by a bunch of level 60 players camping just outside of the town, which made you mad and you talked shit about them in General chat. There were several instances there, and remember this was like 10 years ago, so we're talking about a time when you had to actually go to the instance entrance, get people to go with you by spamming the LFG chat (or General, which is what assholes did), fight people from the other faction who were also there waiting to go in, and while waiting for the rest of your group, you'd just talk about stupid shit in General chat. The Barrens was a huge zone, so there were always people talking.\n\n\nSo naturally, the Barrens General chat became known for its toxicity, WoW meme-generating potential, and some funny moments once in a while. One by one, all servers saw the transformation of the Barrens into this \"special place\". The Chuck Norris jokes came way later, when this had already been established, and it was only natural that Barrens would be the place where people shared these types of jokes the most. In fact, whenever some sort of internet meme became hugely popular, you could be sure that the Barrens chat was already talking about it 24/7."},

In some states, I believe victim impact information can, however, be introduced earlier on—even before trial (e.g. at bail or pre-trial hearings) in some cases.\n\nVictim impact statements can also be presented at parole hearings when an offender is being considered for early conditional release to serve the rest of their sentence outside in the community.\n\nI believe that it's a right for the defendant to be able to challenge the accuracy of the victim impact statements... but that just means they can try and refute certain claims made in the statements; it does not give the defendant the right to question or cross-examine the victim(s) regarding their impact statements."},

{"title":"ELI5: Is it faster to copy one 10GB file across a network or 1000 smaller sized files adding up to 10GB? And why?","answer":"Few large files tend to be faster. Often files are sent one at a time, waiting for the first one to finish before moving on to the next. The network delay adds some delay for every new file but not larger files.\n\nSay, to open and read a file on a remote server, you must first send a request and wait for the response to arrive, during which the connection is mostly idle. Once that is going the whole file can be streamed quickly. When you're done, you move on to the next file, incurring another such delay.\n\nIdeally, you'd have a pipeline where you'd queue multiple files before reaching the end of the current file. Then the next file can be sent immediately after the previous one. The logic for this is more complicated, and it isn't always done in practice.\n\nFor 1000 files adding up to 10 GB I don't think it matters much. The average file is then 10 MB, which typically takes much longer than the round trip to request one of them. If you have a fast connection and a long delay, the round trip could be significant."},

The media were invited to ride a prototype, and complained that the tilting mechanism made them feel sick. At the time, BR was a popular target for comedians and the media, but didn't do itself any favours by suggesting the journalists were simply drunk. In another incident, one of the passenger coaches got stuck in the tilted position, and in a further embarrassment the brakes on one train froze, and that was pretty much the end of the APT.\n\nMore recently, the German rain operator Deutsche Bahn added some trains with tilting mechanisms to its flagship Intercity Express service. These have suffered numerous small technical problems, and since 2010 have been running with the tilting mechanism disabled until engineers can find a solution."},

How do you define anything beyond aleph null?","answer":"I guess I should have been more precise:\n\nOP: Assuming the continuum hypothesis, you can show that the cardinality of the power set of the integers is the same as the cardinality of the real numbers.\n\nThe standard way to prove two sets X and Y have the same cardinality is to show |X| &gt;= |Y| and |X| &lt;= |Y| ==&gt; |X| = |Y|, where | | means cardinality of.\n\nLet X be the integers and Y be the reals. It can easily be shown that the power set of X, P(X) is uncountable. By the continuum hypothesis, which says there is no cardinality between the integers and the reals, it follows immediately that |P(X)| &gt; |X| (an uncountable set must be larger than a countable set) and therefore, |P(X)| &gt;= |Y|. Then by another method (which I won't get into) you can show |P(X)| &lt;= |Y|. This shows that |P(X)| = |Y| and therefore to go from aleph-0 to aleph-1, simply take the power set of the Integers.\n\nAs /u/Not_Me_But_A_Friend pointed out, my proof above only works if you assume the continuum hypothesis. More specifically, in the proof above, I used the fact that P(X) is uncountable to immediately conclude that the size of P(X) is at least as large as the size of the reals. But in general, just because it's uncountable, how do we know there isn't an uncountable set with cardinality smaller than the reals? Then maybe |X| &lt; |P(X)| &lt; |Y| and the proof above doesn't work.\n\nThe continuum hypothesis says that the fact that there is no cardinality between that of the integers and the reals cannot be proven or disproven. Therefore, it is an assumption. Look it up if you're curious. This basically means aleph-1 being the cardinality of the power set of the integers is an assumption."},

Ice takes up more volume than liquid water, so this pushes the water inside the forming ice walls in the only possible direction it can go, upwards.  If conditions are just right, namely if the surface is completely frozen except for a small area and it is freezing at the right rate, the surface of the water will freeze as it pushes upwards, leading to a spike."},

{"title":"ELI5: Does the camera take a photo of a specific point in time? If so why we never get pictures of a deal room when taking pictures inside the house in the night if the light bulb is flickering?","question_detail":"I hope you get what I mean, if the camera captures a specific moment in time, why is the room always seem to be  illuminated? Wouldn't some of the pictures would be taken when the light bulb is off? \n Edit: meant to say dark, not deal.","answer":"Two reasons. First, a lightbulb is typically always producing light while it is on (since it is generating light from heat, and maintains a temperature that produces light even while an alternating current might turn off at a given instant in order to change current direction) so it is typically generating light at a constant rate. Some bulbs (like florescent lights) actually do technically flicker from what I understand, but they flicker so fast our eyes cannot detect it unless it starts to wear out and flick off for longer periods.\n\nBut the main reason is exposure time. No camera captures only a single instant of time - the expose time gives the camera a chance to collect light. Normal exposure times are very short, so appear near-instantaneous, but anything moving fast enough will seem to blur in a photograph. Some cameras can be adjusted to have even longer exposure times so they can collect more light, getting more vibrant colors, detecting dimmer sources of light such as distant stars, or actively utilizing the blurring effect of moving targets."},

{"title":"ELI5:How does ebb and flow work?","answer":"&gt; I was assuming you were refering to earths orbit around the sun. The suns gravity is so strong that it's only marginally weaker on the \"outward\" side of the earth.\n\nBut the sun also causes tides ao even that marginal difference is enough to move some water around both towards the sun and away from it. The tides caused by the Sun are significantly weaker though. Due to that the tides on full and new moon (when Sun, Earth and Moon are (roughly) in a line) are generaly stronger than at half moon (when there is a 90° angle between Sun-Earth and Moon-Earth)."},
{"title":"ELI5: Relativity inside a Spaceship","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"I dont know exactly what you are asking but if you are talking about what you would see relative to anything happening, you can act like you are stationary and everything else is moving and it wouldnt have an effect.\n\nIf you are moving at .99c, and observe a stationary object you will see your clock moving normally but the stationary object time is running slowly, if you are stationary you will see your clock moving normally but the .99c moving objects time will run slowly. If they were different you could decern who was moving.\n\nYour clock always runs normally for you- never slow. It only is different \"relative\" to something else.\n\nMentally, without diving into the math, the easiest way to picture it is: everything is moving through spacetime at \"c\". If you are covering distance close to the speed of \"c\" the amount of left over stuff is small (time moves slowly). If you are not moving very close to \"c\" speed there is a lot of stuff left over and you are moving through time faster. It all (time+speed) equals \"c\". "},

{"title":"ELI5: How do news 'ratings' work? I've never gone on a poll of any kind and rated news from a scale of 1-10. Nor have I ever heard of people doing that.","question_detail":"[deleted]","answer":"Not sure if this is how all ratings are done today but you can definitely sign up for a Nielsen TV viewing rating system device thingy. http://tvdiary.nielsen.com/content/panel/tvdiary7-en-feb2014/home.html\n\nThat isn't the exact link to the offer I usually receive but I think that would work as well. I've been taking surveys for almost two years now and this offer comes up every now and then. Also, there are separate surveys, not from Nielsen, that ask you about your normal television viewing habits. Not sure what they do with the info but it's possible it's part of the ratings system. As an aside, I'm pretty sure it's also where many political polls come from. Have you heard about the whole thing with Ted Cruz being the Zodiac killer? Did you also hear about the amount of Americans that believe that he is? I partook in that very survey (no, Ted Cruz is not the Zodiac killer). I actually found it quite funny when I heard about that survey in the news a couple of days later.\n\nJust as a sort of vent on polls in general: What reporting agencies should really say when they announce poll results is something like \"38% of people who are willing to sit around and answer questions for twenty minutes in exchange for 50 cents thought this way while 62% of people who are willing to sit around and answer questions for twenty minutes in exchange for 50 cents thought this way\". These surveys pay next to nothing, usually. Anyone willing to sit and take these surveys cannot possibly be an accurate representation of the average American. The only reason I take these surveys is because I get $5,000 a year I wouldn't normally have otherwise because I'm currently unemployed."},

Googling 'left brain right brain'  I got a whole page of hits, most claiming to debunk it, and a Wikipedia article that goes way over my head but appears to support the suggestion. Is there any kind of agreed consensus?","answer":"The idea that the left brain and right brain do different things, as opposed to being perfectly symmetrical mirrors, is accurate. We can scan the brain and notice that the areas for certain things, eg auditory processing, visual processing, emotion regulation, etc are usually more on one side or the other, and sometimes entirely on one side. That's true.\n\nDo note however that the brain is extraordinarily 'plastic' -- if part is damaged, other parts can usually pick up all or most of what it was doing. There are people missing as much as 50% of their brain, entire halves of it, who are pretty much fine because their brain has adapted and other areas have taken up the work done by damaged or missing areas. Not always, obviously. It's a pretty fascinating and strange organ.\n\nHowever, the idea that the left brain is all artistry and creativity and soulfulness and the right brain is all logic and maths and calculation, and that people are more left-brained or more right-brained reflecting their personality, is complete bullshit and is only promulgated by the same rubbish quiz apps and blogs that claim to tell you your IQ off a 5-minute questionnaire, your future from your birthdate/starsign, etc. "},

The tools for 3d development have become a lot less expensive and a lot easier to operate as the industry develops more and more.

For instance, are elite female gymnasts forced to retire after their teens due to some wierd aesthetic reasons or is it due to some established medical reason such as: after __ post-pubescent age, the body becomes less compatible with gymnastics training demands?

{"title":"ELI5:If heat rises, why are places with low altitude some of the hottest places on Earth, and places with high altitude usually ridden with snow?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"Imagine a blob of air rising from sea level to the top of a mountain.  As it rises, the pressure goes down, and so the blob of air expands.  Air gets colder as it expands -- feel the air coming out of a bicycle tire, for example.\n\n&gt; If heat rises\n\nYou have to be a little careful here: Air rises when it's *hotter than other air at the same altitude*.  You can't compare air at different pressures without accounting for the expansion cooling factor."},
{"title":"ELI5: What the difference is between upscaling video to 4K and rendering video at its native resolution on a 4K screen","question_detail":"I should probably add a clarification on the question. I meant upscaling, for example, 1080p to 4K as opposed to rendering 1080p natively on a 4K screen. I see things, for example, on UHD Blu Ray players that say they upscale regular Blu Rays to 4K but what difference does that make than just displaying the 1080p output on the 4K screen. If there is no difference why do companies put this forward as a good thing?","answer":"Native 4K is going to be a higher quality image across the board. Not all upscaling processes are created equally, but knowing that you can't create what doesn't exist in the source means that they're essentially using tricks to make the upscaled image possible. Those tricks can work but they can also introduce weird quirks to images.\n\nLet's not forget that in most cases the content on your Blueray wasn't shot at 1080, but was shot at 3.2K, 4K, 5K, or better then down scaled to 1080 and now it's being upscaled again by your TV or player. This introduces yet another layer of possible issues. Hell, in the case of 3.2K it might be upscaled to 4K before being down scaled to 1080 before being scaled up to 4K.\n\nHow much it matters depends who you're talking to because every company wants to push their product, but I think most cinematographers would tell you that their work looks best in the native resolution."},

Basically, a calorie is a calorie and if you eat more calories in a day than you burn, then you will gain weight. People say don't eat at night simply because it is easy to overdo it.

{"title":"ELI5: Why Europeans like F1 and Americans Nascar?","question_detail":"Europeans like Formula One. Americans cannot get enough of NASCAR. \n\nWhy?","answer":"It's not safety measures that have been restricting overtaking. Overtaking has been on the decline with the rise of aerodynamic grip. During the early to mid 2000s when the cars had crazy amounts of aero the overtakes per race were at all time low. The car following just could not pass because when they get close to the leading car the amount of turbulent air that came off caused the 2nd car to loose too much grip. Unless you had a huge (like 1 second a lap) performance advantage to the car in front it was often impossible to get by unless the driver in front made a mistake. It's gotten easier with introduction of the DRS (drag reduction system). Then Pirreli was asked to make tires that degrade quickly. Net results is now drivers save tires and not push so again less overtaking. Couple with the new turbo era where fuel is limited to 100kg per race and now drivers have to save fuel and tires. "},

{"title":"ELI5: Since the rainbow goes from light colors to dark colors, shouldn't it start with Yellow, Orange, then Red - rather than the opposite?","answer":"You are mistaking the rainbow with the color wheel. The color wheel is a way of representing the way our eyes detect colors and mixtures of colors. Because of the way our eyes work, we detect a mixture of short-wavelength blue and long-wavelength red as 'magenta' - although there is no such single color of light. Our mind's addition of this 'fake' color between opposite ends of the rainbow does mislead us into thinking of colors as circular.\n\nGood for color theory and painting; thoroughly misleading for physics.\n\nOh, and there is a very good reason for thinking yellow is 'bright'.

In manual engines this momentum is provided by the mass of the engine itself, the crank, pistons etc.\n\nIf you engage fifth gear and release the clutch pedal then the force transmitted from the slow moving wheels reduces the momentum of the engine's components to the point where the engine does not continue to turn in the time between the explosions in the cylinders. The engine stalls.\n\nThe amount of force required to mechanically stop a combustion engine in this way is called the stall torque. It is easier to meet or exceed the stall torque in fifth gear as opposed to first as the ratio of wheel turns to engine turns is much higher."},

This report has since been debunked as bad science, false claims, etc., and the guy who released the report has basically been laughed out of the Scientific community.  He may have had more serious consequences, but I'm not exactly sure.  \n\nTHEN, you've got idiot celebrities, such as Jenny Mccarthy, who came out after reading this article, goes on national tv, and tells millions of Moms during a daytime tv show that said \"scientific\" report is accurate, and that autism is caused by vaccination.  She might've even said her kid developed autism after he was vaccinated, only to give herself more credence.  This was before the report could be de-bunked, but unfortunately, it is VERY difficult to convince someone of something once they've made their mind up about it.  \n\ntl;dr  the \"risks\" are perceived as causing childhood issues, such as autism, but has been disproven time and time again.

Code expansion has split areas in two, and in recent years, just add a new code to an existing area (called an overlay).  \n\nLong distance usually one or two exchanges over, depending  on geography (where trunk lines are/can be run).

{"title":"ELI5: When a hacker gets the details of 500 million people, what do they do with it? What is their end goal?","question_detail":"I often think this when I see a news story of a hacker getting millions of account details, I wonder what the next step is/what they actually do with that data. You don't really get updates to these stories - So I'm curious if they'd just sell it on, or actually use the data themselves.","answer":"They can definitely sell the details to those looking to buy it, but more importantly, think about what emails do. They're basically your hub for any information about any other accounts you have. Ever forgotten your password for a social networking site and had it sent back to your email? Forgotten a LinkedIn password? Or better yet, a bank account password? How many of your accounts stretched across the internet have the same password, or follow the same sort of algorithm? Getting account details for an email is almost like a skeleton key to the rest of your accounts. Hope this kinda gives you an idea."},

{"title":"ELI5: How do the Hot Pocket crisping sleeves increase my sandwich's crispiness","question_detail":"I'm utterly baffled ","answer":"To expand on this: microwaves literally emit microwave radiation, and that energy is converted to heat when it is absorbed by molecules. As you mentioned, some types of molecules are better at absorbing microwave radiation than others. Crisper sleeves absorb the radiation well and therefore get pretty hot.\n\nYou need that heat to remove moisture from the breading, which is essentially what \"crisping\" is. You don't need a crisper sleeve when heating up a hot pocket in a regular oven because the temperature of the air and the duration of cooking time is enough that the moisture can leave the breading."},

{"title":"ELI5: Where do news agencies get their news, and how do they manage to get it quickly aside from inside sources?","answer":"They subscribe to a news service like the Associated Press who has many employees and freelancers all over the world.

IE Print, online, radio, television, etc. \n\nVery few news reporting sites actually use reporters and they are likely to aggregate news from other sources. \n\nLocal news television stations and newspapers will usually have local reporters who do local news based on tips from the public in addition to reporting news 'on the wire' from the reporting agencies.

{"title":"ELI5:how do desktop light mills work?","answer":"There are two principles at work:\n\n* Light carries momentum. Each photon has a momentum given by **p**=ℏ**k**, where **k** is the wave vector.   \nWhen a photon bounces off a surface, it thus transmits a momentum of **P**=2**p**=2ℏ**k** to the surface. This effect could be used for so called solar sails: sails that are pushed by the suns radiation pressure in order to propel a vessel through space. \n\n* Thermal pressure. One of the surfaces of the mill is black, and the other is a mirror. While light bounces off the shiny surface and pushes against it as described above, the photons are absorbed by the black surface. Their energy is transformed into thermal energy, which heats up the air around it. Since warmer gasses exert a higher pressure on their boundaries, the heated air on the side of the black surface pushes against the mill.\n\nAs you might have noticed, these two effects are working against each other: radiation pressure is more dominant on the shiny surface, while the thermal effect is only significant on the black side. \n\nIt turns out, that in normal circumstances the latter effect will \"win\", and the light mill will be pushed into the direction of the darker surface.

{"title":"ELI5: why do people say churches should lose their tax exempt status for being involved in politics?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"Political nonprofits, like PACs, candidate campaigns, and local party chapters, are required to keep very explicit records of donations and who they go to as per campaign finance law. The state board of elections requires a great deal of transparency to avoid bribery, corruption etc.\n\nReligious organizations do not have to follow such rules.

{"title":"ELI5: Why would any two competing companies not merge?","question_detail":"I know nothing about economics. I tried to google this, but all the results were for \"why would two companies merge\", so I couldn't find any answers :P.\n\nI've been reading about the late 1800s recently. During the industrial boom, large companies would merge together to form trusts like Standard Oil, instead of competing. This way, both parties A) become stronger and B) have less competition.\n\nThis made me wonder, why ever would two companies choose to compete? Why wouldn't AMD merge with NVidia, Coke with Pepsi, all those shoe companies, etc. What is the limiting factor on complete consolidation?","answer":"Companies don't really 'merge'.  What happens is that one company buys another.\n\nSo you have to look at how this effects the people involved in the decision.\n\nStockholders ultimately make the decision as to whether or not the sale happens.  Due to the risks involved, normally stockholders want a fair bit more than market value for their stock.  So if Coke wanted to buy Pepsi, it would have to spend far more than the market value of Pepsi to acquire it.  While this might be beneficial, there's a good chance Coke would never be able to make the investment pay off - after all, if Pepsi's on the block, there are no doubt many other people willing to pay equivalent sums of money.\n\nExecutives advise the stockholders (via the Board) on the takeover.  But the executives of the purchased company are normally going to be out of a job if the takeover goes through.  Even if they hold a position in the new company, it will probably be a position of diminished responsibility.  So they tend to not favor takeovers unless the purchasing company is making them (personally) a very nice deal.\n\nLikewise, the employees of the purchased company will almost always experience a reduction in force.  Part of the reason you combine companies like Pepsi and Coke is to eliminate redundancies and inefficiencies - redundancies and inefficiencies who collect paychecks and aren't interested in being eliminated.  While these employees have relatively little say in the deal, their unions and their Congressional representatives do - and very few politicians want to see their electorate living on the streets because they failed to block an unfavorable deal."},

{"title":"ELI5: How do you express feeling/sarcasm/etc. in tonal languages (Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, etc.)","question_detail":"In languages like English there is a lot of meaning expressed by tone of voice, such as feeling, sarcasm, teasing, etc. How does that happen with a tonal Asian language where there are already changed meanings to the word or phrase depending on the tones used? ","answer":"I could not disagree more. The words used in a sentence are just a part of the equation. A bold but defendable statement would be that the words themselves are the least important factors in the equation. Tone, feeling, dynamics, rhythm, pitch and more all convey so much meaning. English is *super charged* because of the energy we put into the words, not the words themselves. That's the beauty of it. Just one word, \"cool\" can mean many things, like you said! It beats me why you think that makes English a bad language to communicate emotion in. Words are only one part of language. *How we say the word* is *just as much a part of the English language* as is the vocab that we can look up in the dictionary. Inflection is part of the language. Dialect is part of the language. Pitch is part of the language. The language is so much more than words on a page. That's why it's funny you brought up written language, which takes a lot of the elements I'm talking about out. But it seems pretty clear OP was referring to spoken, not written, language. "},

If I give my Steam client free reign to download as fast as it can, it could potentially take up so much of the bandwidth that it starts slowing down my dad's movie. \n\nThis becomes more likely and more important as the network has more devices and more people in it."},
{"title":"ELI5: Do fish feel pain?","answer":"Fish have pain receptors that are very similar to ours. And like with us, stimulation of these receptors makes them react violently and get away from whatever is stimulating them. Fish can even become wary of things and situations that have stimulated their pain receptors in the past. Much of the basic biology of pain that we have is the same in fish.\n\nBut when you say \"feel pain\", you are invoking conscious perceptions, which we honestly don't understand at all. So truly, we can't say whether fish feel pain. We are reasonably sure, however, that conscious perceptions are the result of something going on in our brains, and fish brains are very different from ours. So while fish have the same basic pain systems as us and react to pain in much the same way, it's entirely possible that they don't \"feel pain\" in the same way we do. But we really just don't know."},

{"title":"ELI5 Music playback/how the heck do soeakers work.","question_detail":"This may be too complex for an eli5 but I dunno, I'm gonna try. Basically, why am I able to hit a button on my phone, and have a speaker across the room replicate sounds of a song? Why is it that when I put the needle down on a record music comes out? I put a cd in and because of some engravings on a piece of plastic a specific song is played. How is music stored and played back? \n\nMy small mind was being blown over this earlier so I figured I would ask. Thanks!","answer":"Before I got into music production I always had this unanswered question in my mind: \"How can a simple speaker with just a single vibrating membrane produce such rich and complex music consisting of multiple instruments playing at the same time?\"\n\nThe answer is actually quite simple. Think about your eardrum, it's actually just one single membrane. That means that even if there are multiple instruments each producing their own sounds in your room, ultimately you have have one eardrum (well one per ear but you get my drift) so it can only produce one audio signal with its vibrations. This audio wave is a summation of all the sound waves that are reaching your ear. Then it is up to your brain to read that one signal and interpret all the individual sound waves that produced it. Your brain is actually very good at doing this (we can't even reliably do it with computers).\n\nSo, if you manage to record a song with a microphone (which has a vibrating membrane just like your eardrum), feed the signal it produces into a speaker, which also has a vibrating membrane (it works like a microphone in reverse), and listen to the sound the speaker produces, then theoretically you should hear the same exact song. Your eardrum can't distinguish whether it's receiving multiple individual sound waves from different instruments or just one summated sound wave from a speaker, as ultimately it will still vibrate in an identical way, and your brain will decipher the individual instruments just the same.\n\nNow in reality recording a song with a microphone and playing it back with a speaker will almost surely make it sound a little worse than the real thing, for several reasons (interference, hardware quality, placing of the mic and speakers etc) but I hope that my answers helps you understand this concept better."},

{"title":"ELI5:How does a person get hacked through open ports? And what to do to prevent it?","question_detail":"I know people use a port scanner , but I'm sure there's more to it. Just curious how it works and how to prevent it. Am I only vulnerable to it if I port forward?","answer":"Really a port is just a number. It corresponds to a service running on the connected host. That service might be FTP, telnet, or HTTP web services, just to name a few. Each of those use well-known port numbers that we have agreed upon, which are 21, 22, and 80 respectively. When a hacker sees port 21 open, he knows it is an FTP service running. Now he can attempt a connection using FTP software. Some servers will announce their name and version, such as \"Acme FTP server v2.5.\" He can then try the default administrator password in case the admin was lazy when he setup the server. He can also search for vulnerabilities in that particular piece of software.\n\n\nHow do you prevent all this? The best method of course is to not open any ports. But if you are running services then that is not feasible. Like any other software, whatever server you are running should be configured properly and kept up to date with the latest version and any patches. Some people run their servers on non-standard ports, like for example running a web server on port 8080.  That doesn't make the service more secure, but it does give the hacker another hurdle of searching more ports and not revealing the service's purpose right away. A VPN might be helpful depending on the situation. For example you don't want to open all the ports for a Windows server to the public but there are of course cases where it is necessary to make a connection to one. Another technique is called port knocking. This involves setting a firewall to open a port only after a specific sequence of packets is received on other ports. For example you might set the firewall to open port 21 only after packets are received on ports 4999, 8765, and 1999. This has problems though.\n\n\nAnything you open to the public carries a risk. It's all about balancing that risk with the benefits."},

But when things go wrong, (Maybe you added some complex mod that has complex mobs and blocks [larger drops of water] or you have many mobs [more drops of water]) your bottle may get to the point where it overflows, forcing you to turn off the tap (game freezes) then emptying your water (game crashes)."},

{"title":"ELI5: how does kinetic sand work?","answer":"Kinetic Sand is made of [98% fine grain sand and 2% polydimethylsiloxane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_Sand). Polydimethylsiloxane (I'm going to call it PDSO from now on) is what's called viscoelastic, meaning that it changes its viscosity based on the rate of strain applied to it. When left to it's own devices (low strain because the only force on it is gravity) it will flow very slowly, like a very thick honey; but when you are shaping it (higher strain because you're putting force onto it) it acts like an elastic solid such as rubber. \n\nThe reason for this is the polymer length of the PDSO and what's called branching. You can see a picture of what the polymer unit looks like [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polydimethylsiloxane#/media/File:PmdsStructure.png). The part in brackets is the part that repeats, so you might see 4 or 5 (or even 10+ depending on the chemistry of the reaction that forms the polymer) of that OSiCH3CH3 on a polymer before continuing to the final unit of the polymer. Polymers of this type with polar units like the Oxygen generally have intermolecular forces which cause molecules to be strongly attracted to each other (the Oxygen in the repeating unit will have a strong intermolecular relationship to the Hydrogens in the repeating units and caps), in addition to a physical \"tangling\" of the branched methyl groups (CH3) that are part of the repeating unit, which affects viscosity.\n\nYou can think of PDSO as a wooden stick with a bunch of little branches sticking out of it. If you had a pile of them with the smaller branches all tangled up together, you wouldn't be able to easily pull out one branch from the bottom; but if they were to sit for a while they might get knocked over or fall slowly into less of a pile.

Interest rates are at historic lows right now, so the odds that when the 5 year rate lock expires your rate will drop or stay level are not great, and you can't accurately guess today whether the rate will go up 1%, 3%, etc. So by going with the ARM, you may save a little on interest now and for the next 5 years, but have exposure to much worse rates from year 5 to year 30. And if the rates go up, you're not likely to be able to refinance for something close to what you're getting today in a 30 year. If you don't intend to live in your home for more than 5-7 years or so, then perhaps it's worth the risk to get the lower rate now.

{"title":"ELI5: Why do all living organisms have a desire for self preservation?","answer":"&gt; Evolution is survival of the fittest.\n\nBiologists hate this saying. It appears nowhere in Darwin's writings.  Evolution is about reproductive success. One might say that evolution is survival of the \"fit enough,\" specifically fit enough to reproduce.  \n\nThe problem is that \"fitness\" implies physical prowess, but there are other paths to reproductive success. Some organisms succeed by eating some of their own offspring to ensure there are enough resources available for the rest.  Some birds succeed by building impressive nests to attract a mate.  Some succeed by being more aggressive than competitors who might be better physical specimens.  Some succeed by scavenging meat instead of hunting, so they are less likely to get injured in a hunt and die before reproducing. Humans use their brains every day to overcome physical fitness disadvantages, with strategies ranging from smooth talking to stealthily murdering the competition.\n\nEvolution is about being fit enough to reproduce successfully.  An organism can be less physically fit than the competition, but still be the winner in the game of \"Who Wants to Pass Their Genes to the Next Generation?\""},

{"title":"ELIF:why does power go when there's lighting?","answer":"Two main reasons:\n\n1)  If lightning strikes on or near a power line, the lightning induces electrical currents in the power lines that can cause safety circuit breakers to pop/open.  These breakers usually self reset after a few moments which is why the power goes out for a few moments but then comes right back on.\n\n2) Longer outages are caused by actual damage to the lines and/or transformers along the circuit path.  These have to be repaired by line crews and the line crews are usually not allowed out during an active storm, so you have to wait until the storm passes before your power can be brought back.\n"},

{"title":"ELI5; how does it work in medications that can be used for different purposes (example - indicated in both epilepsy and BPD), that it doesn't adversely affect whatever condition you don't have? (better worded in text)","question_detail":"This is what I mean:\n\nI have epilepsy, and for this I am prescribed lamotrigine. Lamotrigine is prescribed as both an anticonvulsant, and treatment for BPD; but I don't have BPD. \n\nI know you aren't supposed to take medications for conditions you don't have, so how is it that it only treats my epilepsy, but doesn't have any negative effects, considering I don't have BPD?\n\nThis is only my personal example; I'm also asking about other drugs. There's many that have more than one indication, so how does it not have adverse effects on the patient if they don't need treatment for whatever the other indication is?\n\nI'm probably not making any sense; the way I worded it seems convoluted. I hope it's a bit understandable, though.","answer":"It's not just Prozac, all the SSRIs have this effect, but Prozac is probably the cheapest. I think it's about ten cents a capsule at Costco. I don't know if your typical family practice physician would be aware of how SSRIs delay orgasm but urologists definitely are and prescribe it off label for hair triggers.

{"title":"ELI5: Since when did the British loyal family lost its absolute power/control as Monarchs in UK?","answer":"Blame Victoria, mostly. George IV kind of started the ball rolling during the Regency, but Victoria really started the whole thing with the Royal Family being non-involved in government affairs-- Albert died fairly early in her reign and she went into mourning for pretty much the rest of her reign. \n\nSo she pretty much set the mould after that point. Edward VII didn't much help, either, preferring to jet-set (or, considering the times, cruise-ship-set) his way around the bordellos of Europe. After that point, pretty much all they had to do was stand there and look good, tip-top old chap, making sure everything's tickety-boo. "},

","answer":"Silly answer, same as any other hotel, but made of ice.\n\nSerious answer, they only get made when conditions are right, as in winter, and only where temperatures are below freezing for most of the season. The building is usually constructed of river ice which lets them cut it to however big or small they need it to be easily, also clearer than most other ices, and beds and other furniture is covers in furs or insulated upholstery to prevent butts from getting cold. There is usually no heating, for obvious reasons, so everyone is usually bundled in cold weather gear inside. Iirc, the temperature inside can get mildly comfortable, at least compared to the outside, due to trapping guests body heat and not being exposed to open air. Igloo's are basically the same thing, but smaller. They are shelters that protect you from the wind and can trap heat to a degree that the inside is several degrees warmer than the outside."},

{"title":"ELI5: extreme motocross and other motor stunts, how they land perfectly","question_detail":"They often do jumps off of ramps and get off their bike mid air and do tricks, and then land both wheels. Sometimes they spin their bikes around and around mid air. Sometimes the bike flips several times. How do they do this and still land successfully on both wheels? Do they use mathematical calculations to know where to put the ramp, what angle to have the ramp, and what speed to hit the jump at? Or is the bike easy to control in the air to make it land on its wheels no matter what angle you jump off the ramp from? Is it just a matter of practice, and we're not seeing all the times the rider had landed on his head from 25 ft in the air? What's going on here.","answer":"I raced motocross through High School, and since then (33 now) still play ride regularly. It's actually easier than it seems to make the actual jump. When taking off you have to be on the gas a little bit, just enough to kind of carry the front wheel. As long as you're holding on the gas and accelerating until the back wheel leaves the ground the bike will stay level. Beyond that you can adjust in the air slightly. Tapping the rear brake will make the front of the bike come down, and holding the gas wide open (panic rev) will make the front come up. Just the forces on the rear wheel leveraging against the bike itself. \n\nFor ramp angle, it doesn't matter too much as long as it's reasonable. Steeper ramps will shoot you higher, flatter ramps will keep you low but will make the distance longer. I've jumped a good 8 to 12 feet just by hitting a stump or rock just right. Went over 100' every lap at one racetrack in particular, was a nice flat ramp with a long running start. Same track had a steep jump right after a turn, would shoot you almost straight in the air then land about 10' down the track. Had to hit that once slow. \n\nAs for doing tricks, that's just practice. Most of the pro stunt riders have foam pits they jump into for practice, so they can perfect a stunt without as much risk of getting hurt. \n\nDeciding what speed to hit a ramp for a given distance is just a matter of practice. Coming up short or going to far hurts, and you learn quick not to do that. I'd guess that most serious injuries are from over/under jumping a long one. "},

{"title":"ELI5: Why is torque as important (if not more important) as horse-power?","question_detail":"Something about being able to turn a car while the car is moving? \n\nIf I see a car brochure that states 135/4000 N*m/rpm, why does it mean?\n\nHow does it have an effect on the handling of a car (if power is too high but not enough torque for example)\n\nWhat will happen if a car is fitted with an engine with lots of power but no torque at all? (will it make a good drag racing car?)","answer":"&gt; Why is torque as important (if not more important) as horse-power?\n\nTorque is Force, just about an axis. So the force, the strength, you use to push a box across a room, is the same force you use to crank open a valve, but one goes linear, from one point in a room to another, and the other goes round and round.\n\nSo torque is the force use to rotate your tires. Commercial trucks use diesel piston engines that have long power strokes, where the long, slow burn of the diesel fuel pushes down on the piston for the majority length that piston can travel from top to bottom. EDIT: Whereas a gasoline engine will only produce force for maybe a quarter of the stroke.\n\nSpeed is not really a factor of torque. Cars will produce hundreds of pounds of torque (Edit: at thousands of RPM) where trucks can produce thousands (Edit: of pounds of torque at hundreds of RPM). 'Dem tires 'gonna turn... And you need that when you're hauling 60,000 lbs of cargo.\n\nAll combustion engines SUCK at producing torque, especially at low RPM. That's why they have transmissions. The transmission is used as a torque multiplier. The top gear of most vehicles is 1:1 ratio, where the input to the trans (the engine's crankshaft) is rotating at the same speed as the trans output (the driveshaft to the wheels). Overdrive is a gear ratio greater than 1:1, usually 1.15:1, where the torque is cut, so the car basically can't accelerate, but it does have the power to maintain speed, but at a lower RPM, for fuel economy! An electric vehicle doesn't have a transmission because they can run in forward and reverse and produce 100% torque at 0 RPM.\n\n&gt; If I see a car brochure that states 135/4000 N*m/rpm, why does it mean?\n\nThe brochure typically lists the *peak* torque and horsepower, but these numbers are almost entirely meaningless by themselves. You need to see a torque curve, a line graph that shows how torque and horsepower increase over the RPM range. The peak is where it's most efficient. Past the peak, the engine is producing less torque and horsepower, but at the higher RPM, it's producing more often.\n\n&gt; How does it have an effect on the handling of a car\n\nWith enough torque, the car would be able to overcome traction, and break the tires free from the road. The tires would spin over top of the surface, and basically slide independently of your velocity (speed and direction). Your tires and the road/driving conditions greatly effect your traction, so the point at which you slip is dynamic. Softer, sticker rubber provides better grip (R compound tires are literally as sticky as duct/gaffer tape, and get even sticker as they heat up), at the cost of durability, and treadless tires (tread are the gaps cut into the rubber) increase the surface area in contact with the road. Tread is there only to provide channels to displace snow and water - which is unnecessary and undesirable in dry conditions. Tread actually reduces traction when not in wet conditions, because it's that much rubber not in contact with the road. Without tread, though, water can't be displaced fast enough to maintain physical contact with the road surface, and you hydroplane. That's not driving, that's sailing. Buy a boat if that's what you want to do.\n\nHandling is rather dynamic and you have to account traction and weight transfer. Torque factors in to handling insofar as traction allows.\n\n&gt; What will happen if a car is fitted with an engine with lots of power but no torque at all?\n\nSo torque is important to acceleration, and you only need as much as traction allows. Greater than that, and you'll spin the tires. You can never have too much, so long as you maintain traction. Stickier tires and aerodynamics can increase traction, so you can use more available torque. Otherwise, if your car has traction control (which it almost certainly does), it'll cut the engine to regain traction, and TC tends to ding performance diving pretty bad.\n\nBut power, horsepower, is a measure of work. If you want to cross a room in half the time, you need to perform twice the work. SPEED favors power. If you want to go fast, you need power.\n\nRacecars tend to produce huge horsepower. You can convert between torque and power with a transmission, but it's easier to turn power into torque than the other way around, in that if you want a diesel to accelerate like a gasoline engine, you need lots of short gears. Then the transmission is too big, too heavy, too complex, and spends too much time shifting to keep up. Theory doesn't always translate into practice. Those CV transmissions can do it, but none have been built that can survive the torque without ripping apart.\n\n&gt; (will it make a good drag racing car?)\n\nTop fuel drag racing produces 10,000 horsepower, and the engine is basically destroyed by the end of the 1/4 mile race. They drink 11.2 gallons of fuel per second, the fuel and air is compressed almost to a solid state every compression stroke, the exhaust is &gt; 7,000 F, so hot, the flame you see is not from the combustion (nitro meth burns yellow), but from the water molecules above the exhaust pipe being ripped apart into their separate hydrogen and oxygen atoms. Each spark plug is individually consuming as much power as an arc welder, and half way down the track, they've completely burned off - the engine is running as a diesel at that point (compression ignition). If you had a twin turbo Z06 Corvette, and you blew past a top fuel dragster standing still, at 200 mph, the dragster would launch - and catch you in less than 3 seconds, and STILL beat you in a 1/4 mile race.\n\n&gt; (if power is too high but not enough torque for example)\n\nTransmissions are civilization! Engines that produce lots of horsepower can accelerate quickly, and gearing can convert that work into torque, which will get the car moving."},

{"title":"ELI5: How is destroying Ivory not destructive to Elephants?","question_detail":"This may sound silly, but let me explain.

Destroying the ivory will have no impact on these animals, and you can keep the ivory and punish the individuals.\n\nBut my reason to ask the question, is by destroying the ivory, animals have been killed without the ivory entering the market. This means that ivory would become more sparse in the market. Supply vs Demand would tell us that if the Supply decreases while the Demand stays the same, then the price will go up. Suddenly you can now sell ivory at a higher price, so you can then you can pay your ivory hunters more money and even earn more profit. Now there is more incentive for people to kill Elephants because they earn more money than before from it.\n\nHowever if you punish the captured hunters, but let the ivory still enter the market, then the ivory price won't rise, making it less attractive to continue hunting them because the reward isn't going up.","answer":"[removed]"},

{"title":"ELI5: What is happening when a nuclear bomb goes off?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"First you must realize that nuclear includes two types. Hydrogen bombs include fusion. Hydrogen fuses into helium releasing much more energy. But to do this a fission trigger is needed. The fission trigger is an atomic bomb, also a nuclear bomb.\n\nRadioactive elements spontaneously decay into simpler elements releasing subatomic particles. These particles can plow into other atom's nuclei producing more unstable elements which decay releasing more subatomic particles. It is a chain reaction releasing tremendous amounts of energy in a very short time.\n\nNaturally this chain reaction cannot be occurring all the time. That would mean an explosion destroying everything. So any lumps of radioactive material must be small enough that the chain reaction does not occur. Too many subatomic particles escape without plowing into another nuclei.\n\nThe trick to making a bomb is to get enough radioactive material together long enough for the chain reaction to begin and last long enough for the explosion.\n\nIf the radioactive material is dispersed enough with material that dampens this reaction a nuclear reactor is made which can be used to produce nuclear power a long time. A nuclear power plant cannot turn into a bomb but runaway reactions can produce enough energy to melt down the core. There are many safe designs which can be used to make safe nuclear power plants which will not melt down.\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: How is 'memory foam' (I.E. memory foam mattress, pillow) made?","answer":"This is actually more of a chemistry related topic, but essentially foams in pillows/mattresses are created from polyurethane foams. Two major chemicals are used in the polyurethane production and other chemicals are used to adjust the rate of reaction to tweak the final product. The first chemical is some form of isocyanate, if we're talking mattresses then this is a semi-rigid foam and probably uses Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) in the reaction. The second major chemical is referred to as a \"Polyol\" (essentially this means that it has multiple OH (alcohol) groups on the molecule, meaning that there is a high variance in the type of molecule you can use). A catalyst (typically nitrogen based) is used to initiate a polymerization reaction between the isocyanate group and the alcohol groups. The reaction releases CO2 as a bi-product which produces bubbles and causes the rising of the foam. The presence of the CO2 throughout the foam is what causes the formation of the pores in the foam. The reaction continues until it is finished and cross linking can occur between the polymer chains to increase the rigidity. Like I said, other chemicals come into play such as surfactants, catalysts,etc. which will determine the overall foam product's rigidity, porosity,etc. This is a fairly difficult process to perfect and is actually considered one of the most difficult branches of chemistry. \n\n-Source: Worked in a polyurethane foam manufacturing company"},

{"title":"ELI5:Adding something of vast value into \"the market\"","question_detail":"[deleted]","answer":"Precisely. That's exactly what they're going to try to do. This is why the sell price will not drop precipitously. \n\nHowever, because the market is savvy, they know the sell price is NOT a realistic indicator of value, and will therefore NOT buy at that price. The liquidity will drop, and it will be a three way battle of attrition between the market, current platinum market makers, and the asteroid owners.\n\nGenerally, the free market will win out, largely because the asteroid owners will be bleeding operational costs. The slow movement of the sell price will come from the asteroid owner getting into a pricing war with existing platinum market makers. As both shift, the sell price will slowly decrease, until it reaches a point where the asteroid owners are making an acceptable amount of profit at an acceptable market price.\n\nNow, this is how it's supposed to work from a \"pure\" applied economics standpoint. What will most likely happen are political forces will have a say, and there won't be a single sole owner of said asteroid. In which case, the sell price for platinum may settle much sooner."},

{"title":"ELI5: how exactly is sewage water treated and reused? Also, on a related note, where does fecal matter end up after it goes into the sewer?","answer":"Mechanical filtering (screens and such) takes out the large stuff and then the water is put in tanks and a chemical is added. The chemical causes very small particles to clump together forming large pieces that can again be run through a screen type filter. The collected waste can be used for fertilizer or disposed of somehow (not sure how exactly, likely buried in a landfill). The water can then be sterilized using UV light before pumping back to the river/ocean. In small towns they sometimes utilize lagoons where the sewage is pumped to and enzymes are added to break down biological waste. This process takes a longer time but eventually the water is again drained/pumped into a river/ocean. \n\nI do electrical engineering and projects are typically in the municipal water/wastewater sector. Very interesting stuff. The collection and transport of sewage and storm water is an interesting topic as well: massive underground pipes (some big enough to drive cars through), huge pumping stations, dry ponds (a dry field that can hold water in flood situations), flow control gates, and a city-wide monitoring and control system to tie it all together.

{"title":"ELI5: How does charging batteries work?","question_detail":"Also I've never understood if it is best (for the battery) to just charge your phone to let's say 80% or leave it in the charger over night. I'm guessing most phones/devices use the same lithium batteries.","answer":"To know how charging a battery works, you need to understand how a battery makes electricity. A very basic explanation is that there are 2 chemicals in the battery. When they react, it causes a build up of electrons on one side of the battery, which is what makes power.\n\nWhen charging the battery, electricity is put back into one side of the battery and electrons build up then disperse themselves through out the battery (basically the reverse of the discharging effect).\n\nBattery chemistry is a very deep rabbit hole, but your phone is using the newer lithium type of battery and shouldn't be affected by hooking it up to the charger at 80% and leaving it for the night. Most phones have chips that control the charging for protection and will stop once full. Older battery types like Nickel Cadmium would develop a \"memory\" if you would only drain it to 80% then charge it. \n\nAny type of battery will decrease in capacity over time and they all have a finite number of charge/discharge cycles.

{"title":"ELI5: How does popping acne(pimples) lead to scarring when theres no actual skin removal?","answer":"**TL;DR**: *Not so much \"whitehead\" surface pimples, but popping some pimples leads to stresses that bend and twist and shrink and further infect the living part of your skin.. and that can lead to scars.* \n\nSkin is composed of layers, some of which grow upward into a dead skin layer that acts as a seal and largely protects you, some of which is a living layer underneath. When you let a pimple heal, your body absorbs the crap in there and slowly crawls back to fill in the area in a controlled sort of way. \n\nBut when you pop a pimple, what you're doing is draining a little balloon of INCREDIBLY NASTY STUFF out of a small volume of the outer part of your body. That balloon pushed the local skin cells out of the way to form, and now there's a somewhat larger hole there.\n\nSo the sudden release of that under-pressure area MIGHT just have two problems. The first is all of that junk immediately exits the area, leaving a sudden (relatively speaking) gaping hole. The living-skin part can't smoothly and slowly replace that missing volume, particularly if it's bleeding too, so it can sometimes seal the gucky part off in a hurry using collagen (dead scar tissue) to replace stuff that might normally heal more smoothly.\n\nThe second is that it can lead to additional infection because of the gaping hole there. And that additional infection leads to additional swelling or balloons that stretch things further, and lead to more swelling, and so on.\n\nOver time, repeated pops cause a pattern of stresses and collagen build-up, which can lead to scarring in the places where the damage is worst. Your body's really good at healing, but it's not perfect."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why does driving at a speed feel slower/faster on a different day doing the same speed?","answer":"/u/TurtleBurgler mentioned perspective against surrounding objects, but a second contributor is the level of change you just experienced.\n\nIf you were in a city driving into the country on a fairly empty highway, you're really ramping up your average speed. It gets pushed even more if you went through some busy blocks and got stopped by a few streetlights and pedestrians. When you hit that highway after that, it feels like you've just engaged hyperdrive.\n\nBut coming from the other direction and being on that highway for a lot of miles or kilometers, you've become used to proceeding at that speed, so passing through the same area at the same speed doesn't really give you that noticeable feeling that you're going fast.  This can be influenced by surrounding traffic too - if you normally drive at a little above the speed limit but get stuck behind a few senior citizens out for a promenade, when you finally fight your way clear it'll feel more like you're blazing along than if you'd been driving your normal speed for a while.\n"},

But it's not even clear how they should be processed, because who the university admits and in what quantity is an issue that has to be discussed among dozens of decision-makers who also have numerous other jobs they must also attend to. They have a target deadline by which they announce admissions decisions, and as long as they're on schedule for that they're not going to push to go ahead of schedule when there are likely numerous other projects that have much closer deadlines.\n\nAnd when they do process applications and scores, there are likely privacy laws and rules that come into effect so only certain people can view the documents, they can only be stored on encrypted computers, etc that increase the complexity of receiving and viewing the apps.\n\nIs it efficient?

{"title":"ELI5: Why is it that when you have a cold, often only one nostril gets blocked?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"Let me just say a few words about the normal situation and then talk about your cold.\n\nYou have two completely separate noses. A left nasal cavity and a right nasal cavity. They are separated by a wall down the middle called the septum. Each nasal cavity has a number of side rooms called sinuses.\n\nThe air that comes into your nose is filtered by the hairs in your nose, then it is warmed and humidified by the mucosa that lines the basal cavity and the sinuses. Sticking out the side of the nasal cavity are curled up bones called conchae. They are covered by thin mucosa with lots of blood vessels in them and the heat from this blood warms the air. At the back of the nose is a constriction that constricts the flow of air and this causes the air to speed up and in this way you are capable of filling your lungs to the very bottom of your lungs.\n\nNow for the interesting bit. Each side of your nose works for about 90 minutes (from memory) and then it shuts down. The mucosa swells and stops the air flowing through that side of your nose. The mucosa on the other side shrinks and so air flows thro that side. This gives the mucosa s chance to clean and replenish the mucous on the surface. The bulk of the air from your left nasal cavity will go to your left lung, and the air from your right nose goes to your right lung. And this goes left and right every 90 minutes or so. I wonder if this is why we roll over in bed.\n\nSo when you have your cold and BOTH sides get blocked you will only be aware of the side that SHOULD be open. After 90 minutes or so this will swap sides. To get your nose to change sides lie on your side with the blocked side uppermost and with your head slightly back. After a few minutes you will fell it drain and the down side will block up\n"},

{"title":"ELI5:Why are 4 leaf clovers and other items considered \"lucky\"?","question_detail":"Rabbit's foot, Horseshoe etc. Where/when did the belief originate?","answer":"Some are due to rarity and others are due to association with culture and superstition, and many more are a combination of the above.\n\nFour-leaf clovers are hard to find, since most clovers are three-leafed. Hence rare, hence finding one is lucky - easy enough.\n\nEach has their own vague origins - for instance,a cursory glance at the Wikipedia article for Rabbit's foot reveals a possible concept that the rabbit is a transformed witch (and I think we can all agree witches are evil and should be burned and their limbs worn as trophies).\n\nThere's too many to explain, though, and they have generally separate origins. Look them up!\n\nOn a more psychological level, this is probably due to confirmation bias along the line. Confirmation bias being the human tendency to remember and perceive things that confirm their beliefs, making them seem more common.  Someone wears a rabbit's foot, good things happen - they attribute it to the rabbit's foot (erroneously, of course). That happens enough, and maybe other people buy into the perception, and come up with explanations for luckiness (Like, hey, maybe this was a witch!). Something like that."},

Plant, water with Yeates antifungal or fongarid.  If the base is soft or rotten.....it will be hard to salvage...remove ALL dead, rotting matter, plant, water with antifungal but it might die.

First, the aerocapture part.\n\nAerocapture is a fancy term used to describe using the atmosphere to slow down ships. When a ship gets close to a planet, if it wants to orbit, it has to slow down, as the gravity can't hold it at the speed it is going at. Now, this normally costs fuel to do, an aerocapture is a way around this, you aim the ship so that it dips into the atmosphere just a little, the atmosphere slows the ship down and as it leaves the atmosphere, it boosts just a little so that it doesn't fall back into the atmosphere, and now you have a steady orbit. \n\nMain problem with this is that entering the atmosphere causes things to heat up a ton as the ship compresses the air as it enters the atmosphere. If it isn't properly equipped with heat shields, the ship will burn up. This isn't always possible though. \n\nSo, now the magnetoshield part. When entering the atmosphere, the super high temperatures may turn the gas into plasma. Plasma is useful because it has magnetic properties, therefore what we can do is use a powerful electromagnet to take this plasma and form a shield against the heat with it by using the magnet to push and shape the plasma. This basically gets rid of the need for heavy heat shields."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why do borders (between countries) still exist?","question_detail":"I just don't get how and why borders between countries developed. When were they laid out and defined by specific lines yet they are just  universally accepted?","answer":"So long as there are two or more leaders, you will have borders.  There has to be a way to know who is in charge of a certain area.  What if two countries have very different laws? You have to know geographically where one set of laws ends and the other begins.\n\nThink of it just like your house.  We have property lines, which is a border.  If we did not have that property line, then who owns the tree between the houses.  What if one neighbor like the tree, but the other wants to cut it down?  If there was no border, then that would be a mess.  Instead, the two neighbors draw a line between their houses and each gets full control of their side. Now there are no more arguments.  Same applies to countries.\n\nSo how are borders decided on.  Typically one 2 ways: either with a treaty between two countries or through war.  In the past, if there was a dispute over an area, the two countries or rulers would go to war with each other, generally in the area that is being disputed.  The winner one the group that force the other out of that area and keep them out.  Eventually, the losing side will give up and in modern times that usually ends with a treaty that redefines the borders.  Others have pointed out colonizations, which is a form of war.  European colonists showed up to a foreign land and fought the locals for it.  Since the Europeans were so much more texhnologically advanced, they easily subdued the natives and claimed the land as their own.  As others European colonists moved into the area, either an agreement was struck between the countries or a series of conflicts arose to determine those borders.  \n\nHow are border locations determined?  Typically a geographical feature will be used, such as a river, lake, or mountain range.  However, sometimes there is not a good physical feature to use.  In the case of the USA and Canada, the border is so long that physical features could not be used to define the entire border.  In the Midwest, the Great Lakes make for an easy border designation, however, in the west, it is all just flat plains, so a longitude line on a map was used."},

Also I don't doubt that any H.ergaster individuals would go after an injured animal as opposed to a healthy one; should that be an option. Modern societies do focus on meat. Granted it doesn't make up the majority of the diet, it still makes up a large amount. Meat would've been especially important to early humans, as a source of protein, in a part of the world when other sources are scarce.

{"title":"ELI5: Why isn't alcohol a schedule 1 controlled substance","question_detail":"[deleted]","answer":"It is harder to regulate something that is in so common use. Most of the drugs that are legal are usually the ones who became available first before their effects were fully known. Since alcohol and tobacco were widely used long before drugs started to be regulated it is much harder to enforce strict regulations of these drugs. There is an effort in several European countries to regulate tobacco usage more strictly and it does have an effect. The hope is that by having less users you could regulate it harder and eventually make it completely illegal. Alcohol is a bit harder to want to regulate since it is not so addictive and thus have more users who are not shying away from becoming addicted. But even here there are attempts at regulating it harder to avoid over consumption."},

People being ok with unprincipled and inconsistent government as long as it's the \"good guys\" is a big part of why Trump is able to do so much damage.

{"title":"ELI5: How are pyramid schemes started?","answer":"Short answer:  They are, for the most part, cults, though they are based on capitalistic instead of theological or spiritual rhetoric.  \n\nLong answer:  Some people have the charisma to attract followings; they have exceptional skill at sales, presentation, and recruitment.  A pyramid scheme generally plays on these characteristics, much as does a cult.  It preys upon desperate, lonely, or aimless people, giving them a \"secret knowledge\" about a way to generate wealth, and uses the success of its founders as evidence for that method.  However, not everyone is so charismatic, and most members won't have the perspective to grasp the underlying structure of the system.\n\nThe whole thing works by drawing on people's \"secondary\" income sources -- salary, savings, investments, entitlements, whatever.  This is systematically extracted from members through a variety of means, such as membership dues, overpriced products, or the internal sale of \"motivational\" or \"educational\" materials  and pay-to-participate group events -- low production costs and a captive market.  \n\nGenerally, these systems encourage a culture of conspicuous consumption in which discussing failure is a taboo.  People may be encouraged to shut out acquaintances who question the system.  As their involvement deepens, members secretly wrestle with horrible feelings of inadequacy; they seem to be surrounded by success, but they just can't seem to keep up.  The group persistently encourages members to just try harder, and any compliance is rewarded with exaggerated approval -- \"love bombing.\"  Every pyramid scheme has an elaborate explanation of why it isn't a pyramid scheme.  Complicated points and reward systems, \"gameification,\" intense nationalist/capitalist rhetoric, and various other practices can greatly obfuscate the structure.  \n\nThe largest pyramid schemes actually broker political favors in order to avoid official scrutiny; this is actually accomplished rather trivially, as regulation is already sparse, and the mega-millionaires at the center of these monstrosities can easily fund political campaigns, hire top lawyers and accountants, and gain reputations as philanthropists.  \n\nIf someone you know is falling for one of these, be careful in how you address their new activity.  Consider their involvement every bit as thorny an issue as their joining a fringe religion or extreme political group.  Their new \"friends\" may convince them to shut you out if you persistently criticize their activity.  If you really are willing to offer material support to them, and you are willing to put up with potentially radical changes in their behavior and their basic personality, strive to keep the communication lines open, and provide opportunities to do things with them that do not involve the system.  Let them know you're there if they need you -- not as a potential recruit for the system, but as a fellow person, relative, or friend.  \n\n[Source: close acquaintance lost almost everything in a MLM scam]"},

It's not as if the government would reduce spending if others spends more (seeing the rhetoric of Trump 'biggest best military ever...'), the military bases in Europe the US needs for the stuff in the Middle East (see Ramstein)  and the point that the US is the only country to ever use Article 5.\n\nIf the US leaves anyway: It would make the world even more unsafe and chaotic so I am not the biggest fan (I think NATO as a deterrent worked really well) but at this point, it's not as necessary anymore that we should let us get bullied to do stuff we don't want to do. If our government decides yes more spending is necessary than ok, but not because Trump is screaming bloody murder about it.\n\nconsidering the US will probably care more about Asia in the next decades and we want to rather trade with China than have conflicts about influence, NATO will get less and less important anyway. I hope this recent instability will maybe push the EU countries to more military cooperation and planning (not a shared EU army but things where we work together and balance each other out), so maybe we even get sth good out of all this stuff."},

{"title":"ELI5: would universal healthcare work in the us","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"The US has the worlds biggest economy, and not a terribly large population. Most other developed countries have a form of universal healthcare. The main barrier to universal healthcare in the US is the medical and pharmaceutical industries are so powerful and wealthy that their lobbying and campaigns against universal healthcare have made people think they don't want it.\n\nThe economic cost of a health service is balanced by having a healthy population. It also prevents people having to spend their money on insurance, having more funds available. Universal healthcare aids social mobility, people living in poverty don't have to decide between healthcare and food. \n\nIf you look at the UK NHS for example you will see that they didn't just spring into being. Although the NHS was created on a specific day it grew out of many government programmes began during WW2. I think a big problem with US health service campaigners is that they want to make one NOW. Healthcare would be free NOW. \n\nBut to persuade everyone else you have to go little by little, begin with free prescriptions on specific medication, then subsidise regular doctor visits, or start creating state funded hospitals. However, the deep divide in US politics will destroy a fledgling health service, so I don't think it's feasible, not because of the economic cost, but because it would be easy to mess up, tarnishing the idea for a generation. \n\nSome useful articles here, you can draw some parallels between free healthcare and free university tuition.\n\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/nhsengland/thenhs/about/pages/nhscoreprinciples.aspx\n\nhttps://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2016-10-26/3-reasons-the-us-doesnt-have-universal-health-coverage%3Fcontext%3Damp"},

The modems did their dialling and connecting, then the PPP (point-to-point protocol) managed usernames and passwords, then passing packets from the 'internet' on your computer, through the dial-up link, and out to the internet on your provider's computer.  In doing to, it adds a little bit of info to each packet.\n\nIt does the same job now, except there's a little more wrapping. The PPP data is wrapped in either Ethernet or ATM frames (or both), and sent over the wire, with all those layers of wrapping stripped off, layer by layer, at the other end. PPP is added to the system to do the authentication - usernames and passwords - which the system still needs."},

You don't need to eat sugar to live.\n\nThat being said not all sugars are equal.  Sucralose for instance is a sugar but it's [iirc] ~100x sweeter.  So you can use a fuck ton less of it to get the same taste.  Complex carbs are sugars too but they digest slower and don't trigger the same bad insulin resistance that free simple sugars do.\n\n"},

Between all the conversations I've had so far it seems like the major issue is, like you said, overuse of antibiotics. Not antibiotics in themselves.  So I feel like the root of the issue is more along the lines of screening animals for diseases and farms inability or lack of desire to so.  Are there cheap/easy ways to continuously monitor the health of animal on a large enough scale?  And if not why aren't we stressing that?\nAlso food chains are promoting antibiotic-FREE which I think is going to the extreme in the opposite direction.

Meaning a manufacturing company is really good at making said towels, however they have little experience in shipping a towel, so they pay another company to do so. They also have little experience in selling a towel, so they pay another company to do so. Creating a good website to order a product off of is actually really hard to do. \n\nFinally to add on the buying in bulk situation. Shipping costs are a huge burden. For a company in China to ship a single towel they'd have to use fedex and that's not cheap.

There are various technical definitions but is usually works out to an annual rate of at least 50%.\n\nHyperinflation is universally a bad thing.  It usually occurs when a country can no longer easily borrow money, has a large budget definite that greatly excess its economic growth, and prints money to try to cover domestic costs.  Printing money results in inflation, so they have to print more money next time to get the same purchasing power, with creates even more inflation.  This results in a vicious cycle  that makes things much worse.\n\nHyperinflation usually occurs in autocratic governments where those in charge fail to understand basic economic principles. "},

{"title":"ELI5: Why do people with unusually high IQs tend to be lacking in social skills? Is it a product of their environment or is it an issue with their brain?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"I can't find any research that makes any connection between IQ and social skills. Just because there are a lot of websites and blogs that talk about IQ and social skills doesn't mean that it is accurate or that a connection exists. If you could share why you think there is a connection I'd like to take a look at what you have. Specific individuals have to be explained as specific cases without making generalized rules.\n\nScientifically speaking, there is no agreed-upon way to measure social skills nor are their agreed definitions to what social skills are important. Researchers also disagree upon the use of IQ to measure intelligence (here is a link to [multiple intelligences](http://www.tecweb.org/styles/gardner.html) which is replacing the idea of IQ scores). A quick look through any psychology, philosophy, sociology, or teaching journals will reveal this.\n\nIt sometimes appears that intelligent people are more likely to be socially awkward because some individuals are 'redeemed' from their quirks because of their intelligence - so we are more likely to be aware of their high IQ when we interact with them. We are more likely to notice and remember awkward people (and those that are intelligent) than we are to remember normal people. With smart and socially stable individuals we are less likely to notice or care that they are smart, so they are less likely to be noticed (or are simply seen as normal).\n\nAs an example, consider all the friends you think of as socially normal - how often do you think about their IQs? Now think of all the people you know who are socially awkward - how often do you think about their intelligence?\n\nI and my wife teach for a living. From  personal experience I can say that the way a child spends their time is extremely important in determining their behaviors as adults. Children that spend more time reading books or engaged in solitary hobbies are spending less time developing social skills. If the critical window is missed (ages 5 to 12), this leads to many social ticks that have to be consciously controlled for later in life - such as an inability to quickly recognize emotions in others, or an inability to read body language.\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: Why does it seem like airplanes move super slow while on one despite them actually going approx. 885km/hr?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"It's about the distance. They're usually very far away from you. Let's say a place flies at its usual 10km altitude, and you look at it at a 10° angle, then it'll be over 56km away from you on the ground.\n\nBecause of this huge distance, you only need to move your head/eyes a tiny bit, which gives the impression it's slow. If you rotate your view by 45° and look at something that moves past you 5 metres away, you'll cover a much smaller distance than you will cover when you look at something 50 km away."},

In Pop and Rock music the producer is usually behind the scenes, acting during the recording session like a movie director on set: not actually operating the equipment or starring, but telling people what to do. They don't expect more than a producer credit. \n\nIn EDM or Rap music, on the other hand, the \"producer\" can be more hands-on, actually making the music tracks, and so you might see his or her name more prominently. Garrix is one example, Dr. Dre was another example from Rap music."},

{"title":"ELI5 why were movies made in the same year, like 1959, not all in color or all in black and white?","answer":"The analogy to 3D movies now is pretty apt. You wouldn't do a remake of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD in 3D, for the same reason it didn't need to be in color in 1962 (while LAWRENCE OF ARABIA had to be). However, once color TV was widespread, they more or less stopped making B&amp;W movies. I suspect if 3D TV ever takes over, all the movies will be 3D, too."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why do hotel room prices differ between websites?","question_detail":"[deleted]","answer":"Having worked as a pricing exec for one such website, I can answer this.\n\nTom runs a little hotel in the countryside, and while his business is good, he knows well that it could be much better. He's however not tech-savvy enough to build and operate his own website. One fine day, a dude in a suit comes up to Tom and goes, \"You've got a nice place here. Tell you what, I can host your hotel on my website for free. You don't have to pay me a cent.\"\n\nTom is naturally surprised, and replies, \"That sounds good, but what's in it for you?\" to which the suit replies, \"Well... how about this? I display the same rate on my website as you charge a customer who walks in directly. You get more business, and I take 15% of every booking through my site as my cut.\"\n\nTom finds this a good proposal, and he agrees. Some time later, his hotel goes live on the website, and business picks up. Tom expands the hotel size, adding some premium rooms for higher rates. Some time later, another suit comes up to Tom and says \"Hey, nice place you've got here. I could totally host you on my web-\"\n\nTom cuts him off. \"Nah, I've already got a deal with a dude to host on some other website. I don't want to work with two websites. What's the point?\"\n\nThe second suit is a smart salesman. He quickly says \"Let's go about it this way. I'll give you as many bookings as that dude does, if not more. All you need to do is pay me 12.5% per booking through my website. Of course, if that dude fills up your hotel, by all means stick with them. You don't lose any money anyway, do you?\"\n\nTom is unsure, but gives it a try anyway. The second dude's website is bigger and better known, so Tom sees that the traffic generated by the second dude is naturally much higher. Tom decides to further incentivise the second dude. He calls him up one day and says \"Here's the deal - I'm getting plenty of traffic from your site, and I like it. Now I'm planning to drop my room rates somewhat, so please update the rates accordingly on your site.\"\n\nSince the first dude hasn't been bringing in much traffic, Tom simply neglects to tell him about the drop in his room rates. Moreover, he knows that whatever potential money he could have made off Dude #1 will be more than made up for by Dude #2.\n\nIn a nutshell, this is one of the various reasons.\n\nOther reasons can be any of these:\n\n1. Dude #1 appears to be bringing in more troublesome guests to Tom's hotel, so the increased rate is Tom's way of saying \"Either improve the quality of people you send my way, or pay the extra.\"\n\n2. Dude #1 tries to undercut Dude #2 so as to get more traffic (even if it means Dude #1 has to reduce his own cut temporarily) and Tom doesn't like the fact that Dude 1 is cutting prices unilaterally. So he threatens Dude #2 to stop all dealings unless the price is jacked up again.\n\n3. Tom is a bit old-school, and doesn't trust these newfangled websites and dem interwebz. He tells both dudes at the outset: \"Lookit, fellas - this is the room rate I charge for walk-in guests, and any booking I make, I have to get this amount. You get me that money, and whatever else you make off that sale is yours.\" Both dudes now sell for Tom's rate with their own premium (in other words, their cut) and naturally try to maintain the lowest possible margins without going broke. One dude being bigger than the other means that he can afford to reduce his cut a little - again, temporarily - thus undercutting the other dude.\n\n4. Dude #2 sees he has been making a tidy profit all through the year, and decides to have a sale to bring in more money. He tells Tom (and Tom's other hotel-owning friends Tim, Jim and Jon) \"I'm gonna bring in huge traffic for you guys, probably fill up your hotels all on my own. If that sounds good, how about reducing your rates a little so I can get a little bigger cut than I usually do?\"\nThe hoteliers agree, because they get the lion's share of the profits anyway. Dude #2 goes to town on the rates, dropping them to a fraction of the regular ones. Since Dude #1 hasn't been doing well, he can't afford to run a sale with such steep discounts; he's left seething with frustration while Dude #2 laughs all the way to the bank."},

You're thinking about the charged surface moving in relation to a fixed point in space.\n\nBut electromagnetically, your balloon doesn't care about that fixed point in space.  It's not charge either way, so it doesn't exert force on the balloon.  Rather, what exerts force on the balloon is the interior charges corresponding to the static charge on the surface - and those charges are not moving with respect to one another.\n\nSo despite the fact that the balloon itself is moving, the charges are not - and without moving charge, you have no current and thus no magnetic field."},

{"title":"ELI5: How do seat belts work?","question_detail":"What's the physics behind seat belts that makes them impossible to pull when you give them a sharp tug?","answer":"Never disassembled one, but I've been told (with empirical evidence) that the ball can engage the lock if it moves to the sides as well.\n\nMy driver's ed teacher in high school was a character, he was the wrestling coach and I guess he had to also teach a subject so did geography and driver's ed.  Nice guy, good driving teacher (though we basically just ran errands for him), bad geography teacher.  Anyway, he wanted to figure out how seatbelts worked, so I guess he did some Googling and decided a road test was in order.  Without any kids in the car he tried various maneuvers and got the seatbelts to lock up just by jerking the wheel hard to one side and back, to get a sideways lurch without much slowdown.  Not exactly a rigorous test, but it makes sense that a seatbelt should lock up in a T-bone situation.\n\nI'll never forget Mr. Wright, between that experiment, his argument with my friend that a tundra is not a desert, making a girl cry by jokingly giving her detention (which he did to somebody once a week [fake detention, not making them cry]), that time he allegedly bought alcohol for 18 year old seniors on a trip to Mexico (where they were of age), and that one time I got in a bit of a kerfuffle and he just saw the last bit where the other kid hit me in the back and put that kid in detention while letting me walk away."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why does the current lead the voltage by 90 degrees in a capacitor circuit?","answer":"At low frequencies the capacitor will exhibit high reactance (that is, high resistance to charging/discharging).   The output voltage is a reflection of how much the capacitor has charged.    So when the input voltage has worked it's way up to maximum, that's the point at which the capacitor is charging fastest and the point at which output voltage is changing quickest.   So this has the effect that output voltage is out of step with input voltage."},

When the iPad was invented, Apple just picked a name for it, and that was that, all similar objects are iPads, or pads etc if they're different brands.  The guy who invented a chair or discovered a new animal did the same thing.  That crazy egg laying mammal is a platypus because that's what the first British guy to catch one called it.  \n\nThis gets complicated only in relation to language shifts so that what was called a *domus* in Latin becomes a domicile in English via French.

{"title":"ELI5: Why do we sometimes get suddenly thirsty with no intervening period of \"slight thirst\"?","question_detail":"","answer":"Your brain filters out information that isn't relevant. It also filters out information that isn't changing very fast. A slowly increasing amount of thirst is not going to get flagged by your brain as vital, relevant information until it reaches some threshold, especially if you are distracted by other information. Just because you didn't consciously register the sensation of slight thirst doesn't mean that your body was unaware of it."},

{"title":"ELI5:Why is Robin hood so important for the british history?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"How he became so famous in the modern age is easy: Hollywood. The folk tales have been around since the Middle Ages. It was one of many folk tales revived in the 18th Century, and he appeared as a minor character in *Ivanhoe* an extremely popular and influential novel of the 19th century. Many of the specifics of the modern Robin Hood legend, such as the Locksley name, are based on the largely fictional *Ivanhoe*. \n\nI would dispute that it's \"taught\" to every child in the sense you're thinking. It's taught as a legend, in the stories that kids read, and all those movies going back to Errol Flynn portraying him as a rebel hero in 1938. But it's a legend, it's not taught as fact. No-one's expected to believe that he actually did those things he did in the movies. "},

{"title":"ELI5: How come glass does not break when fallen from a certain height?","question_detail":"","answer":"Each object requires a certain amount of energy to “break” it. In this case, the energy comes from the mass of the object, and height from the ground. We call this potential energy, and it can be calculated simply by multiplying the mass by height by acceleration (gravity).  \n\nThere is a certain threshold height unique to each object, and if it falls from a height greater than that, it will break. Otherwise it will more or less stay intact."},
{"title":"ELI5: How does the body/or a developing organ, tissue mass, know which is the most effective placement of a vein or blood vessel while developing in the womb? Is there some sort of developmental pressure at work that helps the new body know where best to place the new vessel/vein?","question_detail":"","answer":"The placement is not always the best route.\nThe laryngeal nerve is a nerve branching down from the vagus nerve towards the larynx. It then branches into the superior and recurrent laryngeal nerves.\n The laryngeal nerve can be spotted in a wide variety of animals, from fish to mammals. The structures around the nerve and the nerve itself are homologous to each other and so evolutionary theory postulates that animals evolve from others by distortions and changes in these structures. In fish, considered to be more evolutionarily primitive, the nerve heads straight from the brain, down to the larynx. However, in mammals, the structure of the head and development of the neck from fish-like organisms cause the recurrent laryngeal nerve to become \"trapped\" under the aortic arch in the thorax. Given a slow and gradual evolution from the biology of a fish to the biology of a mammal, there is no way for the nerve to magically jump from one side of the aortic arch to the other. And so, in mammals the nerve controlling the larynx first delves deep into the chest cavity and then finally up to the larynx. This nerve that should be a foot long in a giraffe is around 15 feet long due to this detour."},

But with liquids the molecules still want to stick together but can't hold their shape, so you have a substance with surface tension.

When you slack your khakis, your loose pubes become liberated.  Pubes whose time has come and gone will ride a breeze into random locations nearby.\n\nThe ones that land in the urinal get flushed away.  The ones that fall to the floor are dragged away on your shoes.  The ones that get onto your clothes leave the bathroom with you.  The ones that fall onto the urinal cake get flushed away, but it takes a bit; you may try whizzing on them really hard to knock them loose, if you're concerned about their removal.  The ones that land in your mouth are ingested.  The ones that land into someone else's bush are carried home with them and re-purposed as native pubes.\n\nThe ones which come to rest at the top of the urinal have no means of escape.  No one cleans there.  No wind is strong enough to free them from the curvature of the porcelain where they fell.  Very few will lick around the perimeter of the urinal, to gather cheeks full of warm and hearty pubes for the coming winter.\n\nThey remain there, surviving well beyond any one of us, for whatever comes beyond this life."},

One time I put my phone through the wash - I never leave my phone in my pants when I take them off to put in dirty laundry, but this one day, I was in front of the machine loading it when I decided to take off the pants I was wearing and wash them too. And boom.\n\nEver since then (maybe 4 years ago?) I have not pressed start on a single load of washing before eyeballing my phone."},
{"title":"ELI5 explain what are pointers and pointer to pointers in C-programming","question_detail":"","answer":"A pointer (declared like int *ptr or char *ptr, float *ptr depending on the type you want to work with) is a variable that stores a memory location of another variable. So in C, to access this memory location, you can say printf(“%x”, ptr); (obviously, there are so many other operations you can perform, I just chose printing the location in hexadecimal), but in some (if not most) cases you want to work with the data stored at that location a pointer is pointing to, not necessarily the address. this way you can say printf(“%d”, *ptr);. You may find this piece very useful to understand more about pointers.\nThese are the basic concepts that should be taught in the programming school. We at Holberton School (https://www.holbertonschool.com/) start teaching from scratch, and cover all concepts of programming world."},
{"title":"ELI5: Why do some liquids evaporate faster than others (e.g., rubbing alcohol vs. water)?","question_detail":"EDIT: I'm asking about liquids just sitting there at room temp, not boiling like in a pot over a flame, or maybe there is no difference?","answer":"No one has covered why so I will give it a shot while trying to keep it simple.\n\nFor water and alcohols there are hydrogen atoms sticking out at the ends of the molecule which are connected to an oxygen. The oxygen pulls an electron from the hydrogen which makes it kind of like the negative side of a magnet. The oxygen doesn't have to share that negativity with anything so it's strength is pretty high. When another water molecule comes in the positively charged H comes near the O and the \"stick\" together and because there are only 2 elements in water there is a lot of room for this interaction to happen. \n\nAlcohols have OH groups like water but they have stuff on the other side. That stuff causes O to have to share it's negativity more, and creates less room to do it in. \n\nThe more negative the O can be the stronger the connecting with the other liquid molecule. The stronger the connection the more enegry you need to separate them. Because alcohol has a weaker connection it requires less energy to break apart from each molecule."},

If you are building a house, you want to decide exactly what you are building beforehand, because will impact the decisions you make right from the start.

{"title":"ELI5: why is hyper-partisan “news” like Fox only a recent phenomenon? What prevented biased/false journalism in the past?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"In part because news as entertainment is actually a recent phenomenon. \n\nWhen television first took off in popularity, the government had to figure out how to allow some companies access (license) to broadcast to our TV sets. If you think about it, early on that license to own a whole “channel” on your tv was pretty valuable, but the government basically gave it away to the earl tv broadcasters. The only price? They had to provide a certain amount of public service programming, primarily interpreted as news. \n\nSo news wasn’t how a tv channel made money, at first. News was how they paid the cost of access to their markets.\n\nThen enter the era of news competing for viewership. This started pretty early, but it really started picking up with the advent of cable and so many more available “channels” that they could create 24 hour/day news channels. \n\nOnce you start trying to win over audiences with news, it was only a matter of time before some news programs started catering to specific niches. \n\nThen Fox News discovered they could draw audiences that felt disillusioned by other news programs that insisted on having actual journalists reporting facts. Fox has succeeded on a news programming model that has zero journalists - they don’t actually go out and find news stories at all, they just report. They spend all their money on their “personality” broadcast anchors. It’s an incredible savings on journalist salaries, which helps make them even more successful as a business. \n\nNow that news sources are fracturing even further and more and more depend on the “reporting but not researching” journalism model that Fox has pioneered, we’re going to see a very confusing future. The idea that there is no difference between informed and uninformed opinion is gaining a crazy kind of popularity. You might say we have our first uninformed, low information voter president now.

{"title":"ELI5: What psychologically drives people to argue on the internet?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"Does this differ from arguing in person? Guess, it's simply times easier to argue without being confronted. With many people striving for their 15 minutes of fame by pronouncing their viewpoints, we all have gotten used to online proclamations about something or other, proclamations easily disagreed with by someone. The internet provides the two required ingredients for epic brawls. Anonymity, which does away with inhibitions, while alcohol does the same in bars, and passion from a critical number of people. Crowded bars provide them in real life, as does a forum dedicated to a sub topic.\nWherever you have lowered inhibitions, and a critical number of passionate people, you will have arguments."},
{"title":"ELI5: How could the instantaneous velocity of the point of contact of the rolling object is zero when it is pure rolling motion?","question_detail":"[deleted]","answer":"&gt; Rolling where there is no sliding is referred to as pure rolling. By definition, there is no sliding when the instantaneous velocity of the rolling object in all the points in which it contacts the surface is the same as that of the surface; in particular, for a reference plane in which the rolling surface is at rest, the instantaneous velocity of the point of contact of the rolling object is zero.\n\nIt's talking about the motion of the *contact* point.  So if the wheel is *purely* rolling, and not sliding at all, then the contact point is not moving in relation to the ground it's sitting on.  Imagine a wheel with spokes.  If each spoke touches the ground and then stays fixed on that point without sliding left or right, as the wheel rolls along, then it is *pure rolling*, because it's not sliding at all - the ends of the spokes aren't moving at all in relation to the ground that they touch."},

It help build an identity for a group of people and gives them something to call their own. It can also serve as a quick means of identifying like minded individuals in the world at large.\n\nWhen a meme finds appeal outside that original subculture a lot of these benefits slowly vanish. As the meme moves towards mass appeal it can become disconnected from the feelings and ideals of the original group, and if the meme becomes popular enough it can lead to outright rejection.\n\nWhen a meme has fully made this transition it is \"dead\" to the original group because they no longer use it. It's not a nefarious act by normies, it's just a slow loss of identity brought about by well meaning moms on facebook."},

{"title":"ELI5: How do things actually move if there is net force's are zero?","question_detail":"I know that in order for an object to be at rest it has a net force of zero acting on it. It makes sense if you push against a refrigerator with 5N of force, the friction of the refrigerator pushes back with 5N. \n\nBut how can objects move if their net force is zero?\nFor instance, say I push against a refrigerator with 20000N and now its moving at a constant velocity. Well, now the friction of the floor is pushing back with an equal force of 20000N due to Newton's first law. So if I push with 20000N and it the friction pushes back with 20000N how can it possibly move? Is this due to the fact that the refrigerator has a certain amount of weight?","answer":"If I understood well, here is a way to explain things:\n\nYou are mixing up between two things, forces ON the refrigerator, and force DONE by the refrigerator. Say you push the object with a constant 5N, and that it's enough to overcome floor friction. What the object experiences is Weight (Due to Gravity), Floor Normal Reaction (It's effectively holding the object \"up\"), 5N Push, and Floor Friction due to the push. This will be different from zero, hence we have an object in movement. \n\nNOW, the second part you need to know is when we study the push source, say it's a hand. What the hand experiences, among other forces, is the 5N reaction of the refrigerator !\n\nGravity is always there, which makes it that there usually is weight + \"reaction\" from floor, but that isn't the case for other forces. Not because I'm pushing an object with 5N and that it pushes me back that it EXPERIENCES 5N push AND reaction."},

What was the first contribution to this myth, and why did it persist?","answer":"Legacy was once very important.  Everything a man had, his money, his property, his titles, his reputation, was passed on to his eldest son.  There was a strong notion of \"blood\", a vital essence that defined a family and that was passed from one generation to the next.\n\nGiven this, it was crucial a man could make sure any children his wife bore were his, especially the oldest ones.  People wanted a way to be sure badly enough, so they invented one.  Girls were warned of a life of poverty and shame if they let a boy \"ruin\" them, and a nod from a midwife or nun gave a man the assurance he needed, false though it may be."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why are computers more web-based while mobile phones more application-based?","question_detail":"[deleted]","answer":"Because computers come in many more configurations, it's not worth it to make optimized versions for each one.  There are many fewer phones and the OS provides better optimized services.  Once you don't need to be optimized, a web app is cheaper and as good.\n\nApps for Facebook and the like are more about making sure you don't navigate away, so they can manipulate you more.  It's a non-consurer business model."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why does heating up something with sugar such as Tea and Cookie Dough make it sweeter?","question_detail":"So I was experimenting with my cookie dough skills and I tasted it when cold, it was sweet but not as sweet as when I heated it up a little. This is the same with tea or coffee, tasting it cold seems to make it less sweet than when it's hot. Does heating something 'activate' the sugar in it? And does it change its nutritional value?","answer":"&gt; Does heating something 'activate' the sugar in it? And does it change its nutritional value?\n\nIt doesn't do anything to the sugar but it does do something to your taste buds. Our taste buds more easily sense sugar when warm rather than cold; many flavors change depending on the temperature although the food itself doesn't change. The nutritional value is the same at either temperature."},

{"title":"ELI5: When you get a cut, how does the body know how to heal it back to the same way it was before and not just grow out of shape.","answer":"It doesn't, not exactly. It just dumps a load of \"repairing\" materials anywhere it detects damage and hopes for the best. \n\nGenerally speaking, if you're dealing with a relatively small wound, any possible difference will be so small as to be invisible but of course people do sometimes have \"scars\" which is basically where the would doesn't quite end up in the same shape.

{"title":"ELI5:How are files compressed?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"There's multiple approaches to compression, first of all some compression is \"lossless compression\" and some compression gets rid of some information that isn't important.\n\n\nLossless compression basically just looks for repeating patterns so and tries to not store the same thing over and over again. Sounds simple, can be simple but nowadays there's very advanced methods to find the most efficient way to store those repeating patterns and reconstruct it. \n\n\nAnd then there's compression that loses information, that's usually used for sound (mp3) or images (jpg). Turns out humans have rather shitty eyes and ears and our brain is very good at lying to us and correcting things. For example our ears just can't hear two different sounds when one is a lot louder (it's called masking, one sound masks the other sound). So you can basically look for those tones and just remove the one that humans can't hear anyway to make the files smaller. And codecs like a high quality mp3 use all the research we have about human hearing and tries to remove all the things we won't notice anyway to compress a music file. "},

Sometimes they have both an internal battery based clock and a way to synch time over the network. For most computers this happens over a protocol named NTP but there are other ways. \n\nTVs can get the current time via the broadcast signal even if they are not connected to a network. And some radio-clock based devices get the current time via a long-wave transmitter. Other more obscure methods exist."},

Let's imagine a cube moving through rain coming straight down at a rate of 1 inch per hour. Now, the top of the cube gets wet by rain hitting it. The front of the cube also gets wet as it moves into the drops in front. How wet the front gets is purely determined by distance. Basically, there are so many rain drops between you and your goal. For each one that falls out of the path, a new one falls in, so the speed doesn't matter. \n\nFrom the top, it's flipped.

{"title":"ELI5:the endocrine system consists of the pineal gland, adrenal gland and gonads, how are these parts related to be under the same branch of medicine?","question_detail":"","answer":"Say you want to move your finger. You need a really fast way to make a really fast action. So your brain sends the signal via a nerves. They rapidly tell the muscles in your lower arm to squeeze together causing your hand to move. Then they quickly stop.\n\nBut say you want to send a slow signal that lasts a long time. Your body likes to use hormones for this. These are signals that do things like make the hair on your arms grow. It's a slower process and has a longer effect.\n\nThe endocrine system is all the parts of your body that make and release these hormones into your body. They affect lots of different parts of your body from how green your pee is to how big your body grows. \n\nThe reason why they are linked together is because these different organs make hormones that let them talk to one another. So one gland sends a signal to another gland to make more of a certain hormone. Then the second gland sends a signal back to the first one and says that the task is done. So if the first gland isn't working properly, then it affects the later ones too. This creates certain common patterns that allow endocrinologists to figure out what the problem is and fix it.\n\nSo say Alex tells Bob who tells Carl to build a bridge. You show up and see that the bridge isn't built so cars can't cross the river. This is a problem. But who screwed up and why? Did Alex not tell Bob? Did Carl get the message, but decide not to do the work? The endocrinologist is the doctor who figures out what's going on."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why are all pickup trucks bad on fuel?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"Zero aerodynamics is the main one, and optimized for towing. The towing optimization means the gears are lower, putting the engine into the powerband at normal speeds (opposed to economy cars that put the engine into more efficient low RPMs at normal driving speeds). Towing optimizations also mean a larger radiator is required, this requires a larger flat spot on the front (making aerodynamics more difficult). Tires capable of the heavy loads generally mean worse rolling resistance, and sizing drivetrain parts up for rolling resistance makes it worse.\n\nThe added weight of the frame obviously doesn't help, but honestly, weight matters very little for highway driving (other than the rolling resistance), it does kill MPG in city driving though."},

{"title":"ELI5: the difference between saving a file as a.pdf and printing to a .pdf","question_detail":"To be more specific - when you save a file many programs give you the option of saving as the pdf file type. However you can also use the print option and select \"save as pdf\" as your printer, which also produces a pdf file.","answer":"They don't necessarily create the exact same PDF file.\n\n- When you print a document, you basically give the printer enough information to properly represent your document *on paper*. You know, downscale everything you don't really need until you only provide the information that you can actually see on the paper after it's been printed. When you print to pdf, you intercept that information after it's been created and dump it into a pdf instead of printing it on paper.\n\n- when you save to a pdf, you tell the software to create a digital copy of your document and represent it as good as possible in that digital copy. Or to represent it as good as possible, creating a file as small as possible.\n\nThe principal difference is that once something is printed, you can't really tell what quality you had on the original document because it's the printers capability that controls the quality of the document. But if you save a pdf directly, you still have some control of the documents quality up until it's saved.\n\nThe print-to-pdf feature is really mostly intended for *making sure that you have a copy of something you want to print*, rather than splendid for creating pdf documents.\n\nPersonally, I use it all the time. For saving receipts and stuff when I'm traveling and don't have a printer nearby. And for that horrible map software one of my customers use that can't export to images without crashing, but for some reason produces flawless printouts."},

{"title":"ELI5:How fantasy football works.","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"First you need to understand how an actual season of football goes (at least the basics) as fantasy football mirrors that. 1. Draft, 2. Season, 3. Playoffs. Then you need to understand how a game is scored. Player positions, scoring, etc. There are certain positions on a football team that are most likely to score points for a team (Quarterback, Wide Receiver, Running Back, Tight End, Kicker) These positions will make up you team. You also get a defense position, where an entire teams defense can give you points.\n\nFirst you get a group of people together, grab some beer, and draft your players. All leagues are at bit different as far as picking logistics like timing, number of players, etc. But you end up determining the order, and then each time it is your turn, you draft a certain real life player to be on your team. Then continues until you fill up your bench. You pick strategically to try and get the players that will earn you the most points, and also a balance among all positions.\n\nNot every fastasy football league is set up the same time, but a basic team form is usually:\n\n1-Quarterback, 3-Wide Receivers, 2-Runningbacks, 1-Tight End, 1-Kicker, 1-Defense\n\n*or*\n\n1-Quarterback, 2-Wide Receivers, 2-Runningbacks, 1-Tight End, 1-Kicker, 1-Defense, 1-Flex (can be a WR, RB, or TE).\n\nYou are also given additional spots ~6 to use as a bench for additional players.\n\n\nNow, after the draft is complete, the teams in a league will be matched up against each other every week. The players active on both teams earn points through their real life performance. The winner of each match up will have more total points earned that week than the other  team.\n\n*How do you earn points?*   Many different ways!\n\nQuarterback: 1pt per 25 yards passed, 1 or per yard rushed, 3pt per passing touchdown, 6pt per rushing TD. The lose a point for turnovers.\n\nRunningback &amp; Wide Receiver &amp; Tight End: 1pt per rushing yard, 1pt per 10 passing yards, 6 points per touchdown. \n\nKicker: 1pt per extra point kicked, 3-5 point for field goal depending on length.\n\nDefense: 1pt for fumble recovery, 1pt for sack, 6pt for TD, 2 points for safety.\n\n\nEvery week you play a different player in the league and by win/lose create a record to compare to other players.\n\n\n\n"},

The city with the lower AQI is said to be less polluted.\n\nI was lead to believe Nitrogen Dioxide is far more dangerous than particulate matter, as particulate matter can be filtered out with a mask, while Nitrogen Dioxide can't, so why isn't this labeled as a more polluted city?","answer":"Would you be worried about the health effects of living in China if you wore a [mask like this](http://respro.com/store/product/cinqro-mask) on days when the PM2.5 and PM10 were high?\n"},

{"title":"ELI5:Why can some children explain exact what they feel when asked what they feel and why.","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"Well, if it was a scripted television show, that's probably your answer.\n\nAccessing our feelings is a learned behavior. I think there is some anecdotal evidence that teaching this skill to young children helps them understand and control their mood better. Instead of launching into a tantrum, they may be able to recognize the feeling in them, and communicate it in a helpful way to others. On the flip side, there are some adults who do not seem to have learned this very well.\n\nThe point being, this can be learned. It's like asking \"why are some kids really good at the piano, while others can't play music?\" It's a skill which requires learning and practice. There are ways to work on this even as an adult."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why do mobile phones lose reception when going up/down an elevator?","question_detail":"","answer":"Oh, as an EE student specializing in microwave engineering and wireless communication, I can tell you that the angle is important - but in an elevator, not so much. However - when the elevator isn't moving, its doors are usually open - does your phone work good with the door closed, but the elevator being still?\n\nAlso, when the elevator starts to move, it emits quite a strong field, which can interrupt your phone's reception. From my own experience, as a young kid living in a block of apartments with an elevator shaft near my bedroom, I would notice my CRT monitor sometimes go all wavy and shit for a short moment. I was sure it was ghosts, but my dad explained me that it's just the elevator passing by my room. Sure enough, that was it.\n\nSo if a moving elevator emits a field strong enough to disrupt a CRT's image, I'm fairly certain it can disrupt your reception as well."},

They deinterlace signals before displaying them. Flat panels update the screen in different ways, but none scan line by line. Similarly,  camera's with CCD or CMOS sensors don't scan line by line.

{"title":"ELI5: Why can't we remember our early years of life even though they're extremely important in brain development?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"You can.. you just don't know it.\n\nChildren's most formative years are 0-5.  You might not remember much from that time but your actions as you get older most certainly suggest you do remember..\n\nWere you loved?  Were you abused?  Were you spoiled?  Were you pushed aside and felt abandoned, perhaps raised in a daycare?\n\nLet's say you were spoiled.  Let's say your parents never said \"no\" to you... as an adult you would be inclined to be a person who cannot take no for an answer.  You might be very frustrated with not getting your way at work, or in relationships.  You never learned how to deal with not getting your way.  Maybe you are in debt because you have no self restraint and buy anything you want because you feel entitled.\n\nMaybe you were the first born of several kids and your mom had another kid when you were under the age of 2.  You were pushed aside because the baby needed your mom more than you did.  If she had no family to help this would be worse, but kid after kid it might have reinforced you to feel unloved.  \n\nAll things that happened to you hen you were young do affect you even though you don't directly remember the events.\n\nKeep in mind that your brain was small and had to remember certain things, but not others, it selected what to remember directly and other things entered the subconscious to be buried by new memories."},

{"title":"ELI5: Differences in prescription glasses bought in stores compared to optometrists.","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"There is an important difference in why people need glasses: people can be nearsighted or farsighted. \n\nNearsightedness means your lens projects the image in front of the retina instead of on it. Therefore you see less accurate in the distance (this can be as close as a few meters). Usually neirsightedness occurs during childhood growth, and can go from very light (- 1) to almost blind (-8 or even worse). These are the more expensive prescription glasses. There can be big differences from person to person, and even between two eyes. Therefore a specialist's prescription is necessary. \n\nFarsightedness is the opposite: the image is projected behind your retina, and reading things up close is difficult. This is often because of wear and tear on your eyes and the surrounding muscles as you age. These are the reading glasses older people need. Since this is all fairly generic, you can find cheap +0.5 to +2 or so glasses in a simple store. "},

Or that there is just a really long string of zeroes? An obvious solution is to have a special code that starts and ends a message. But what if the transmitter is incapacitated during sending, before the end of message code? You can't really say \"Oh, after this many zeroes, we should automatically end the message.\", since a message can contain an arbitrary number of zeroes.\n\nSo let's take a look at something else. As you may know, light is a wave. And since it's a wave, it has an amplitude: how strong the wave is. What you can do is maybe send a signal on top of the wave. For instance, you could say that an amplitude of 3 is one, and an amplitude of 1 is zero. That way, the receiver knows that when it receives something, the transmitter is sending. And an arbitrarily long string of zeroes is still a signal that's being sent.\n\nNow, since light is a wave, it also has a frequency. This is (roughly) the colour. And you can change this as well to transmit a message. For instance, red is one, and green is zero. This has the same advantage as the previous method.\n\nIf you think this all sounds pretty convoluted, and surely nobody's going to use it, well, you're wrong. The first method, where the amplitude is changed, is called amplitude modulation. And the second method is called frequency modulation. Or, for short AM and FM."},

Police are not governed by those laws, and are controlled by the laws of the nations they operate in. \n\nWhen I said militaries are bound by international convention, they are and they aren't. Countries join them voluntarily, though smaller nations can be pressured to join with the threat of economic sanctions by larger nations. However, larger nations are rarely heavily pressured to do so. For instance, the US didn't adopt the UN resolution to ban the use of napalm against civilians until 2009, 25 years after its creation. To be binding, the resolutions have to be adopted into the law of the nations they apply to. "},

{"title":"ELI5: What do programmers have to do to rig a spin- wheel?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"Are you sure those are the odds or are you just assuming the distribution is uniform? If the odds of getting 50% are 1/12, the odds of never getting it in 50 spins would be around 1.2%. If the probability of landing on a non-metal is 1/3, then the probability you wouldn't hit it at least once in 50 spins is around one in a billion. Of course, that's not zero, but it seems more likely those aren't the actual odds.\n\nAs for how it's implemented, you use a pseudo random number generator. This is an algorithm that generates a sequence of numbers that appear to be random (though they are in fact deterministic). A very simple (but not very good) example is the middle square method.\n\nYou start with an initial number (this is called the seed). Let's suppose you start with 5678. Then you square it, to get 32239684, and then take only the middle four digits - so the next number in the sequence is 2396. Then you get 7408, 8784, 1586, and so on. This will generate a sequence of four digit numbers that look random (but really they aren't).\n\nA good pseudo random number generator should produce output that is statistically uniform. If you want a different distribution, you would usually map those values in a way that results in the desired distribution. For example, if  I want to output \"heads\" with probability 60% and \"tails\" with probability 40%, then I would first generate a uniformly distributed random number in the range 0-1 (or any other range that is convenient to use) and then return \"heads\" if the number I get is greater than 0.6."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why was hitting 400km/h so hard to achieve in this age of technology?","question_detail":"I don't get why it is so hard to make a car that would be able to hit 500 km/h. Or 600 etc... \nBesides the tires can not hold the force, what other aspects make this task so hard for automobile factories?","answer":"Yes. The tires were designed to be in that kind of environment, so there being an external cause is not really what limits going at those speeds (in terms of Retro's answer and the thread's question overall).\n\nThey are designed to withstand a sudden acceleration to whatever the Concorde's landing speed is, including losing rubber and getting superheated."},
{"title":"ELI5:Suspension forks for bikes, how do they work and how are they made?","question_detail":"","answer":"There is no such thing as a suspension fork per se. You've got the fork, which, just like on a bicycle, connects the handlebars to the front wheel, then you have the suspension, which is generally mounted on the fork, generally in the form of one shock absorber on each side. Some motorcycles use a different system, such as the Telelever on some series of BMW bikes, but that's a story for another day.\n\nAfter that, the suspension (the shock-absorbing part) of a bike works just like the one on a car or any other suspended wheeled vehicle."},
{"title":"ELI5: What is a fiduciary","question_detail":"ELI5: Ive seen it on so many posts about finance but have no idea what it is what they do or why people ask if someone is one before taking financial advice.","answer":"To add on to that, a fiduciary also comes with certain irrebutable legal presumptions. \n\nFor example, the rule against self dealing. Imagine the principal (i.e. the person who is trusting the fiduciary) owns a car. \n\nThe fair market value of the car is $1,000.\n\nThe fiduciary wants the car, but because she is a fiduciary decides to pay double fair market value ($2,000). \n\nIn most jurisdictions, this would be a violation of the fiduciary's duty. They would be irrebutably presumed to have acted against the interests of the principal because of self-dealing, even though the fiduciary could offer overwhelming evidence the transaction benefited the principal.\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: what's the state of the USA's national debt and how did it get this way?","question_detail":"","answer":"One thing to bear in mind is that Government debt works a bit differently than personal debt.\n\nThe US government can borrow massive amounts of money at extremely low interest rates over very long terms, much better than the type of loan you or I might take out from the bank. And the government gets its income from taxes. When the economy grows, tax revenues go up. And the economy is pretty much always growing.\n\nSo if the government borrows some money and says it will pay you back in 20 years, 20 years from now the government will have a higher income, and paying you back will be easier. Plus the currency will be under inflation, so the money they're paying you back will be worth less than it is today. And this all goes even better if they use the money they're borrowing to grow the economy even further.\n\nThis all adds up so that there's very little downside to the government taking on huge amounts of debt. It's almost cheaper for them to pay for stuff with loans than it is to pay in full right now. And by increasing government spending, that money goes back into the economy and can be used for stuff that's good for everyone."},

{"title":"ELI5: why is american healthcare so bad?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"I think the question is meant to be why is it so expensive.  There are a few reasons for this.  One reason is that people will sometimes go to the emergency room and never intend to pay the bill.  This kind of thing happens enough that those of us who do pay have to cover the cost of those who don’t.  \n\nAnother reason is that America comes up with a lot of the revolutionary medicines which other countries then buy/use at cheaper prices.  It costs money to run tests, hire scientists, and everything else that goes into making medicine.  Someone has to do it, and America happens to be good at it. \n\nOverall our care is amazing.  It’s really fast and reliable.  As you’d expect, though, a good product is usually expensive.  Sure, we *could* go to the cheap, sketchy clinics, but a lot of us opt for the nicer hospitals even though they cost more. "},

{"title":"ELI5: How to compare living cost between city/country?","question_detail":"Let say between USA and Japan. Here we have USA starting salary at USD2500 and Japan at 200k Yen (make up).

It's a fairly robust basket of goods.\n\nThe words you were looking for were 'purchasing power parity', or PPP.

There is a reson that there was a lot of fighting for control of islands in the Caribbean. The low cost sugar only exist to day because of mechanization and new sources like sugar beet, corn etc. Even sugar canes was first introduced in Europe and the middle east in the 8th century so before that there was no alternative to honey. \n\n\nSo wine have been made for thousands of years so it make seance to produce a alcoholic drinks with grapes and use honey as a sweetener.

We work 7 days and we're off 2, except when the 7th day is a Thursday we're off 4 days, thursi to sun so they don't have to pay over time. So for instance say I'm off Monday and Tuesday this week. I work wed,thurs, fri, sat, sun, mon, tues and I am off wedand thurs. But because the pay period ends Friday my paycheck is just Saturday, Sunday, off mon, tues, then wed, thurs and Fri. With the rotatingdays off, even though we work 7 days straight, the way it's structured, you're only getting 40 hours. The sat, sun, mon and tues, then off wed thurs is anothervpay period"},

We were about 1/4 mile below the top of the mountain.  Floods and fast-running water was common during rains.

{"title":"ELI5 why can’t we get a thought out of our head","question_detail":"What I mean is things like when you start being aware of your breathing and not being able to stop thinking about it. Or when someone tells you your nose is always in your sight and then you can’t not see it for a while. \n\nAnd how does it stop? Just time or can we do something to make it happen sooner?","answer":"Just to be clear: I have no educational background in psychology. I have a passion for it, but I am not educated to be a professional.\n\nBut let’s get into stress, and anxiety. The idea here isn’t to obsess over why we obsess certain things, but perhaps understand that we will obsess certain things. Specifically, things that we often do not consider.\n\nYour brain does a lot of work. Everyday, it fills out certain spots in your vision that you cannot see, concludes thoughts and patterns, and ignores certain things that don’t require a large amount of energy or attention. When these things are pointed out, we are left with discomfort. \n\nExploitation of these aspects can sometimes be entertaining. For example, an optical illusion, takes the pattern processing action of the brain and continuously flips it. It makes it foreign, and us uncomfortable. It becomes bothersome because we CAN’T understand it, or more so, resolve it.\n\nSo when someone points out something autonomous, such as breathing, we realize something that the brain has kept unimportant: how we are breathing. From that point, we begin to reign in the autonomous functions as something we CAN control. However, we never noticed it in regular functioning, so now we try to estimate the norm of breathing.\n\nHow can we guess what “normal” is, when the brain has always controlled it.\n\nSimilarly, the nose is often times “filtered” out by the brain. It takes up a small space in our field of view,  however, it appears larger because of the crossing that takes place in the left and right eyeball. Despite this, the fact that our nose is consistent tells the brain that it isn’t as detrimental to the rest of the body, and so it excludes this. When someone points it out, we begin to focus in on the things that we again ignored, and in turn, begin to approximate what “normal” is.\n\nI suppose that to remove these anxious thoughts is to remove what caused them to begin with. Stop focusing on things that are irrelevant to our survival and day to day functioning, and instead take a moment to just relax. \n\nWhere are you? What are you doing? What else is happening later today. What’s that thing that we really wanted to read? Let’s do it. Let’s find something else in the meanwhile. \n\nCured."},

Each finds there are 10 possible locations, with values given as 10, 9, 8, …, 1 points (these can be interpreted values as potential profit size in millions of dollars).\n\nThe game works as follows. Each simultaneously chooses where to build each of the 5 stores. The payoffs will depend on where the stores are located.\n\nIf a location ends up having both stores, then they split the value of the location. If a location ends up with just one store, then the business that built that store gets the entire value.\n\nHowever in this specific situation if the same company owns both locations they will still get the entire value while devaluing the opportunity cost of a similar competitor putting down roots nearby."},

The difference is that your regular paycheck withholding already accounts for your estimated deductions. Bonuses aren’t part of that calculation, however, so they’re withheld without any deductions. Also your employer can choose to either withhold it at your top marginal rate or skip the math and use a statutory 25% withholding rate. Add in Social Security, miscellaneous other taxes, 401k contributions, and any state income taxes and then take home is substantially reduced. "},

So why do I have such negative side effects? ","answer":"The first noble truth in buddhism is that \"life is suffering\".  To put it another way, our nervous systems are calibrated by evolution to always feel uncomfortable.  The discomfort of this or that situation is actually the discomfort of your brain being tacked like a fridge magnet onto different situations.  \n\nSo consciousness is inherently more painful than unconsciousness.  \n\nIf your body is desperately in need to iron that means there are a lot of biological processes that are on hold or have a backed up queue, but they're disabled so whatever connection your consciousness has to those things is registering \"blank\".  Just like if your toe freezes it become numb.  No activity, no sensation.  \n\nSo you add this nutrient and these processes start back up.  What was unconscious becomes conscious again, and with that consciousness comes awareness of the state of those processes.  They're behind on their tasks and their state is shit.  \n\nIt's like if you had a warehouse full of junk, but it was locked and no keys.  You need the keys to clean that warehouse.  Locked warehouse is hidden from consciousness.  Then you get the key.  Yes the key permits you to get to a state where you have a nice empty warehouse that's enjoyable, but on first opening that door you have a giant mess in front of you.  The mess goes from unconsciousness back into consciousness.  \n\nLong story short, your body had a bunch of problems it couldn't even be aware of from lack of iron.  You supply the iron and those processes come back online, and the awareness of the problems comes back faster than the solution.  "},

{"title":"ELI5: What shape would cameras shoot in if they weren't cropped into a rectangle? Or are they cropped into a rectangle at all?","question_detail":"","answer":"Think of a porthole on a ship. It’s round, right? Now place a piece of plywood with a rectangle cut out. The light coming through the cardboard is rectangular, even though the hole for light in the wall is round. \n\nCameras have round lenses because it helps create uniform light intensity and focusing.  That is, no corner or portion is more distorted than another corner or portion.  \n\nThe light is then projected onto a sensor, which is typically rectangular, that is then fed onto the film that is rectangular. What happens to the round light? The more distorted edges are cut off, leaving only a well focused middle portion that is a rectangle. \n\nThe reason for this is fairly sensible. It’s easier to store and display rectangular photos and slides. Squares or rectangles can evenly and uniformly take up a space, and cutting the paper out for it leaves less waste than a circle. \n\nTry cutting a piece of paper into 18 squares or rectangles. Try cutting the same paper into as many circles as you can. Squares, if measured well, leave no excess material, but circles always do. \n\nBeyond that, rectangle frames are easier to produce because they just need to be nailed together with straight pieces of wood with minimal processing round frames need additional sanding and shaping. \n\nSo, ultimately, the shape a picture takes is based not on the lens but the film and the sensor. A square lens would still produce rectangle pictures. \n\nYou could change sensor and film shape to get different shaped images, though. That’s just not how we do it, for efficiency and usability.

{"title":"ELI5:Can someone explain me the concept of gravity assist?","question_detail":"If I understand well, gravity assist is when you use the gravity of an object with significant gravity(sun/planet) to propel another object in a given direction though I'm a bit confused by this concept. If we use the Sun as an example of an object of strong gravity and a comet as the object that will be using gravity assist, what makes it that the comet doesn't go right into the Sun instead of getting propelled elsewhere?\n\nAlso, I'm not sure if the concept of gravity assist is only a term used for our own rockets/ships or if it's appropriate to use it also with comets and asteroids...","answer":"yes.  planetary probes use this concept to bleed off energy to get into orbit with a planet.\n\nThe truck analogy for gaining speed applies if you pass \"behind\" a planet, i.e. you pass opposite of the side that faces the sun.  The planet is then pulling you along with it.  If you pass \"in front\" of a planet, the planet is moving towards you and it effectively slows you down.  \n\nNASA used this in the Apollo missions.  They aimed in front of the moon so that the gravity of the moon slowed down the craft, meaning less fuel is needed to slow it down enough to enter lunar orbit. If there was an issue on relighting the engine to reach lunar orbit, the craft would have bleed off enough energy thanks to the moon that it would return to earth itself once it was out of the moons gravity well.  It's called a free return trajectory.\n\nSome craft also use a technique called atmospheric braking, where the craft dips into a planet's upper atmosphere, and the atmospheric drag further reduces the craft's speed."},

{"title":"ELI5: If distant galaxies are moving away faster than those close to us, will we ever reach them?","question_detail":"","answer":"GN-z11 is not 13.4 billion light years away from us. \n\nThe light from it has traveled ~13.4  billion light years before it hit us so it was emitted 13.4 billion light years years ago.  it was not 13.4 billion light years away when the light as emitted as the universe expanded when it traveled towards us.\n\nThe 32 billion  light years is the distance it is away from use today. It it is not the time it take to travel to it at the speed of light because of the expansion of the universe.\n\nIn fact even if you traveled toward is at the speed of light you would never reach it. The even horizon ie the max distance today that light emitted from us can reach is 5 giga parsec 16 billion light years and GN-z11 if farther away that that today.\n\n\nThe expansion of the universe is in the 73-67 (km/s)/mega parsec. So a object that is far enough away will because of expansion have a increase in distance faster the the speed of light. It is at 299 792 458/67000 = 4474 mega parsec or 14.6 billion light years.\n\n It look like the reson for the differences from the value in the last paragraph is that the number was from the wiki page and from a old article where estimation of the expansion of the universe was less well know and could be lower and it is a rounding up to integer giga parsec so it is on the safe side. You relay need to do a more complex calculation because the universe expand while the light travel and therefor expand faster. The dividing speed of light with expansion give a distance that you can for sure never reach.\n\nSo anything that if farther then the event horizon is unreachable unless we find a way to travel faster the the speed of light. GN-z11  is certainly beyond the even horisont so we cant reach it."},

Grab them, detain them.  Since you can't legally hold them with their kids, detain kids too.  Parents then plead no contest to the charges of illegal entry, are given kids back and promptly kicked out.\n\nThat's the process.  \n\n&gt;Why not ship them over to Mexico, from where they presumably entered?\n\nBecause Mexico is barely even a real country, it's a satrapy for organized crime.  Consequently they don't accept their legal responsibilities as the delinquent nation when it comes to illegal southern border crossings.\n\nSo we have to do it ourselves.  \n\nAnd much though I'd like it, we can't just summarily send them all back once caught, ICE has to get a deportation order from a judge.  And court is time consuming and expensive, which is why we need a wall to physically deter border crossings and cut down on the literal numbers of entrants.  "},

{"title":"ELI5: Why under certain lights do my hands and feet look like they're moving in \"slow motion\"?","question_detail":"","answer":"Looking through these, I dont think a single response gives a good explanation of physically why this happens.\n\nThe *why* is a combination of 2 main factors:\n\n1. The rods and cones in the human eye during \"normal\" vision aren't all active at the same time. That is because after they activate and pass on a particular peice of visual information down the chain to get processed by the brain, there is a cooldown / recharge period where that particular cone or rod cant be used to get visual information.\n\n2. The eyes dynamically adjust their sensitivity to light. When there isnt much light coming in, it dialates the pupils to let at much is as it can, with the end result that cones and rods are more sensitive to light.\n\nWhen these combine, you have a situation where the eyes have their sensitvity set for low light conditions, and then a bright flash comes along and activates basically *all* of the cones/rods, resulting in a brief period where the eye literally isnt taking in any new information since all the cones/rods are \"recharging\" at the same time."},

{"title":"ELI5 Why does mouthwash sometimes seem to shake loose stuff that a toothbrush doesn’t?","question_detail":"I get that oral hygiene is a thing best dealt with by multiple different forms of attack. \n\nWhat I find is that I’ll brush away for a while and my teeth will feel reasonably clean. Then I’ll go for the mouthwash and as I swill it around, I come to notice just some small bit that somehow has come loose after the brushing. How is it that swilling a liquid around seems to get bits that a brush with its mechanical action has missed?","answer":"Generally, a toothbrush only cleans the surfaces of your teeth. You need floss and mouthwash to get in between them.\n\nDepending on which direction you're moving the brush, it's possible to push stuff between the teeth or to the back of your mouth, where mouthwash will then have to chase it out."},

{"title":"ELI5 how do sailboats sail against the wind?","question_detail":"","answer":"They \"tack\".\n\nWhat they do is point at a diagonal direction into the wind, with the front angled like this. Stars are the boat, and the wind is blowing down.\n\n    .......|.......\n\n    .......|.......\n\n    .......|.......\n\n    .......|....***\n\n    .......V.***...\n\n    ......***......\n\n    ...***.........\n\n    ***.............\n\nThis allows the wind to push against the sail, so you get some force, but the water resistance behind the \"long\" side of the boat is greater than the water resistance at the front of the boat, so the boat moves forward rather than directly away from the wind. Basically, the water on the right side of the boat forms a sort of \"wall\" that causes the boat to \"squirt\" forward rather than just travel down, in the same way that if you press down on a grape seed on a table it'll squirt out rather than go straight down.\n\nThe boat travels in this way for a while and then tacks - changes direction to the upward-left. It does this over and over until it reaches its destination, following a sort of zigzaggy line. \n\n\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: Why do high divers survive the fall but someone jumps off a bridge and dies?","question_detail":"","answer":"Studies of suicides from the Golden Gate Bridge show it’s quite possible to survive the jump, provided you fall the right way—feet first and leaning forward slightly. But you might suffer broken bones and internal injuries. If someone rescues you, you will likely survive. If not, you’ll eventually drown. The water there is very very cold, and you can’t survive long wearing regular clothes.  If you jump head first you may break your neck or get a concussion and be unconscious and drown. I would imagine that diving in a perfect diving form, arms first, would be helpful to survive but people don’t dive that way when they’re trying to kill themselves.\n\nFYI: the people who have survived regretted jumping immediately. I remember one survivor saying that as soon as he jumped, he realized all of his problems were fixable except perhaps this one. He tried to orient his body to survive the drop, he fought to stay afloat after he hit the water, he was quickly rescued and he is still alive now. "},

{"title":"ELI5 - Does a charged battery weigh different than a discharged one?","question_detail":"","answer":"There are two answers to this. One goes into relativity and Einstein, and states that a battery with 100kJ more of energy will weigh 0.000000001 grammes less, by applying E=mc². This true, but that's not a relevant amount of mass.\n\nApart from this, most batteries are sealed, so no matereal comes in or out. This means that the battery has the same amount of stuff inside it no matter what the level of charge.\n\nHowever, some types of battery are not sealed. They may generate gasses while charging or discharging, of may absorb gas from the air. An example is the zinc-air batteries used for hearing aids. These have a piece of zinc metal when charged, which oxidizes, taking on oxygen and becoming a little heavier, as it discharges. Many people are working on metal-air rechargeable cells which would give off oxygen and become lighter as they charge, but there are plenty of challenges to solve and these are a long way off."},

The result is a bunch of individual ICs, also known as \"dice\" (the plural of die), also known as \"chips\". Or if you work in the industry, \"parts\". \n   \n**TL;DR** - Parts is parts. "},
{"title":"ELI5: why are the tv cables red green and blue instead of the three primary colors? How do they make yellow?","question_detail":"","answer":"Pretty much this. Humans view color as a spectrum from red to blue, being most sensitive in the middle, a bright green. Since we have three types of cones (color-sensitive eye cells), we need at least three colors to accurately represent a significant amount of color. To do that, we take red and blue from near the edges of the spectrum, and some in-between color. Green tends to be the best for that, according to [many](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CIE1931xy_blank.svg) [studies](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CIE_1976_UCS.png) that have been done on color mixing. Add light of these three \"additive primaries\" to get any color you wish (aside from really pure spectral colors which may lie on the curved bits outside the triangle of primaries), according to their ratio. Note that red, green and blue are not the only possible primaries, they are just the ones that cover the largest area (or \"gamut\").\n\nThat is for light. It works for displays as it does for lamps (see also: RGB light strips). For paint, it is different. If you start with white instead of black, you already have the maximum of each primary. You now need to take away stuff. So to mix paint colors, you need one \"subtractive primary\" for each additive primary, that removes the corresponding color from the white canvas. For the red/green/blue system, that means you need a paint that contains every color but red (cyan), every color but green (magenta) and every color but blue (yellow). Since cyan is commonly seen as a type of blue and magenta as a type of red, \"red, yellow and blue\" are often named as subtractive primaries for simplicity, but they are not optimal and severely limit your range of saturated greens and purples. Since in school, you usually deal more with paint than with multi-color lights, you were probably taught the subtractive primaries.\n\nAnother thing /u/Redditdude45 touched on, the color components transmitted to a TV are not necessarily the same as the primary colors used by the display. It turns out that the human eye can see far more detail in the brightness of a color than in its hue or saturation, so really most effort needs to be spent on the luma (brightness) signal, which is derived from adding the three primary intensities with pre-determined weights. All chroma (color) information, i.e. saturation and brightness) can be carried with far less precision. So Luma is carried over the best wire, with two color signals, \"red minus luma\" and \"blue minus luma\" carried over two not-necessarily-as-good wires. To use the same colors as RGB, luma is transferred over green, r-l over red and b-l over blue."},

Level 7 and 8 meausure what you would usually think of, how long they can stay submerged in water at certain depths. Also a device doesn't have to have both numbers in its rating id a company doesn't want to get it tested and certified for some reason. In this case the number would be replaced with an X, so IPX8 would be 8 on the waterproof scale and unrated on the dust, and IP4X would be 4 on the dust scale and unrated on the water one."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why is drinking 2L of water good when you pee most of it away","question_detail":"If you drink less you pee a lot less. Doesn't it just even out?","answer":"TLDR: water is needed for almost everything in our body. However, we pee it away to maintain our blood pressure and ion balances.\n\nBecause water is needed for almost every bodily organ and their function. For example:\n\n- Water is the basic building block of many cells and tissues. Drinking water helps our body make and maintain cells and tissues.\n- Water helps maintain ionic balances and osmotic pressure. In simple terms: we have many minerals in our body (salt, potassium, chloride etc) that rely on certain ratios of water for transportation throughout the body.\n\nBut the answer to your question relates to how water contributes to blood volume and kidney function. Our kidneys need sufficient blood flow to create urine. Put simply, when blood passes through the kidney vessels, the kidneys filter out toxins from blood and release the toxins as urine. Without proper blood flow, blood cannot easily pass through the kidneys. As a result, the kidneys cannot filter our blood as well. The toxins build up in our body and we can get really sick. Water helps to maintain this blood flow by increasing the blood volume.\n\nWe pee most the water our as a way of maintaining blood pressure. If we didn't urinate any water, excessive water would build up in our bodies. We now have too much blood volume and this leads to high blood pressure. This could lead to numerous problems:\n\n- Oedema/tissue swelling (when your blood vessels overload, they can push water into your tissues to compensate)\n- Increase the stress on our heart (it has more blood to pump)\n- Seriously mess up the balances of our ions in our body (see above)\n- Strokes. Excessively high blood volume, increases the likelihood of the blood vessels breaking, causing a stroke.\n\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5 : How do allergies occur? What determines the lethality of an allergy?","question_detail":"","answer":"Your immune system is supposed to recognize foreign things and protect your body from them. One of the ways it does that is through a complex system of chemical signals. For example, antibodies. \n\nAntibodies are produced by specialized immune cells, and act as messengers or signals among other things. Antibodies come in different types: IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, IgE. (Stands for Immune globulin A/D/G/A/E).\n\nAntibodies are based on Y shapes, with the wide end binding to foreign things. Some types have more than 1 Y. See [this illustration](https://www.quizover.com/ocw/mirror/col11448/m44823/Figure_42_03_02.jpg)\n\nWhen antigens (anything an antibody can bind is an antigen) are introduced into your body, they are picked up and processed by special cells called antigen presenting cells. These guys then show the antigens to immune cells who learn to recognize them and make antibodies against them.\n\nAllergies are a type I hypersensitivity reaction, mediated by IgE. IgE is found on the surface of mast cells, and when the cell is exposed to an antigen it can be bound by the IgEs on the surface. If two or more IgEs bind it then the show is on - the mast cell recognizes a foreign substance and sends the alarm, releasing a host of inflammatory and signaling chemicals. (This is referred to as degranulation, because the chemicals are stored in little packets called granules in the mast cell). [Illustration of binding and degranulation](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joseph_Moellman/publication/232961594/figure/fig1/AS:202674659172353@1425332812316/Type-I-hypersensitivity-is-mediated-by-IgE-and-induces-mast-cell-degranulation-FceRI.png)\n\n\nHistamine is one of those chemicals, and causes a lot of the allergy symptoms - constriction of airways, increase in secretion, dilating blood vessels, itching, redness, ect. Anti allergy medicines are often anti-histamines.\n\nThese reactions are supppsed to be helpful in protecting the body but if the reaction goes too far or is too strong, the airways can constrict too tight (like an asthma attack), blood vessels dilate too much dropping blood pressure and making tissues swell drastically, hypersecretion, ect. The over-reaction is called anaphylactic shock, or anaphylaxis. It's life threatening. That's why people with severe allergies carried epi-pens - epinephrine opposed most of those actions, constricting blood vessels, reducing secretions, ect."},

The reason for this is its lighter than a traditional steel coilspring, and provides a lot more room for the chassis and suspension design."},
{"title":"ELI5 The curly anus that is brass instruments.

So a tube that plays the note C when you blow into it can only play C G C E G Bb and C.\n\nSo in order to change that, some brass instruments were equipped with valves to change the length of the tube and thus the fundamental pitch. When you press a button it opens up a length of tube which the air can access.\n\nThe trombone on the other hand has a slide which can change the fundamental pitch just by changing the length of the slide manually."},

{"title":"ELI5: How come the person in the back of the canoe has more control over direction than the person in the front?","question_detail":"My friend and I were arguing over who's responsibility it was to control the direction of the boat while canoeing. It's been my experience that the person in the back has to make fewer strokes in order to control the direction of the canoe than the person in front. I just don't know how to explain it. ","answer":"It is always the responsibility of the person in the back.  Aside from all the other reasons (a crewed vessel cannot be a democracy, tradition, easier to see what is going on in and around the boat etc.) it is easier to steer from the back than from the front.\n\nMost steering involves ruddering...directing the water flow with an angled paddle.  It is much easier and safer to do this at the back of the stroke (dragging) than at the front of the stroke (poking?).  The reason I say safer is that the forward poke is unstable: if it catches, the momentum of the canoe can easily cause a capsize or injury where a dragging paddle would just pop out of the water.  The forward poke also cannot be combined with an ordinary power stroke.  The most important part of the canoe stroke is the entry: if you don't have a good hold on the water before you pull, your stroke will be inefficient and weak.\n\nSo I've probably over-explained why steering at the back of the stroke is better than steering at the front of the stroke.  Now lets look at how the position of that force affects the canoe.\n\nThe canoe turns around the approximate center of the boat.  If we were to tie a rope to the center of the boat and pull, the canoe would not turn, it would just move sideways.  On the other hand, if we tied the rope to the bow or stern it would be very easy to turn.  The farther the force is from center, the easier it is to turn the boat.\n\nBy now, you probably see where this is leading.  The front seat has to leave room for the paddler's legs so it has to be a few feet farther back from the bow than the back seat has to be from the stern.  The actual steering happens in line with or just behind the seat in either case.  This means that the bow paddler ends up steering from close to the center of the boat while the stern paddler steers from very close to the end of the boat.  Hence, it is much less work to steer from the back seat than from the front seat.\n\nThere are other specific advantages to that arrangement:\n\nSince the bow paddler has much less impact on the course of the boat, a less experienced paddler will cause less trouble and a more experienced paddler can use a \"bigger\" (more powerful or more efficient) stroke than if they were worried about tracking.\n\nOver longer distances the stern paddler has the whole length of the boat to use for sighting their course.  This results in smaller deviations and more efficient paddling for the whole boat."},
{"title":"ELIF Why does the brain create nightmares if they are disturbing and often unrealistic","question_detail":"","answer":"Yikes! So little information provided here regardless of good bits here and there. Let's get started:\n1) The primary purpose of dreaming is to recreate \"troubling\" events an individual is likely to come across in the future. The reason for this is to solve the problem and/or make sure the issue is not forgotten until it is solved or fixed. PTSD for example.\n2) This takes us to \"why are they unrealistic, sometimes?\" There's two bits I can think of right now A) You might have not encountered the problem but imagined it to the extent the brain found it to be a problem that needs fixing. B) Even of our bodies are well adapted to the laws of physics, our brains are subject to the constant daydreams we feed it. Whether it be our own imagination daydreaming or any sensorial experience the brain has to process (such as watching tv.)\nGotta run! Hope all of this made sense."},

{"title":"ELI5: What happens if a country goes bankrupt to the extent they can't even get a bailout loan? Like if Greece hadn't been able to get its loan? Do they get bought and assimilated into another country?","question_detail":"","answer":"I mean that's mostly correct but \n\n&gt;Printing money is one approach to a debt crisis.\n\nIs not, at least not to pay off *foreign* loans.  While that may work for a country like the US, which is able to borrow money in its own domestic currency most other countries are not in that position.\n\nWhen countries borrow money from foreigners they have to pay back that money in US dollars or Euros.  If Greece had been using the Drachma instead of the Euro, no one would have loaned Greece money to be paid back in Drachmas.  They would have still loaned Greece money to be paid back in dollars or Euros.\n\nThe same is true of Venezuela - Venezuela has control of its own currency, the Bolivar, but that doesn't matter because no one has ever loaned Venezuela money to be paid back in Bolivars.  Instead, money loaned to Venezuela needs to be paid back in dollars.\n\nCurrencies for those countries also aren't traded on the world market - again when Greece was on the Drachma no foreigners would buy it, and no foreigners have ever bought Bolivars.  Because of this, most countries can't just print money to pay off their debts because they can't print the money they need to pay those debts off, and can't trade their own domestic currency for foreign currency.\n\nCan the US do that?  Sure, and that's where you get into another huge discussion as to how feasible and beneficial that actually is.  But that simply isn't an option for much of the world, and certainly would not have been an option for Greece if it had still been using its own currency at the time of its debt crisis."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why are microscopic images always vibrantly coloured?","question_detail":"Like the title asks - why are microscopic pictures (of dust for example) always coloured green, blue, red and yellow?","answer":"Most types of microscopes able to resolve tiny details don't take color pictures. There are two main reasons for that: One is that sensors able to distinguish colors use a grid of color filters that only let light of a particular color through. The light that gets absorbed by the filter  can't be detected, which makes the sensor less sensitive. So instead, they use black and white sensors. Our eyes work in a similar way, by the way: The rods, which make up the majority of our optical cells on the retina, can only see black and white, making them more sensitive to light. So at night, we mostly lose our color vision.\n\nThe other reason is that some types of microscopes don't just shine light on the sample, but instead point a focused laser or electron beam on it. Since there is no color in the illumination source, any image taken this way will be black and white only.\n\nThe problem with these black and white images is that most people can't make much sense of it. So in order to make them look easier on the eyes (and better on a presentation), all the different things in the image are then colored in by hand. "},

{"title":"ELI5: Why are movies adapted from books different from the book's content?","question_detail":"I just watched Ready Player One. I loved the book, and was excited for the movie, but the events were a lot different. ","answer":"Because no one flinches at the idea of spending an entire day, or multiple sit-downs, to read a book.\n\nIn film, anything over 120 minutes is long. \n\nTo use RPO as an example, you've got a fixed timeframe to A) introduce your hero, B) introduce the Oasis (or at least enough of it to carry the plot, and C) have a complete plot. Something's got to give, and typically it's going to be something that doesn't serve the 3 points above. For instance, in the film two characters have a passing conversation about what they would do to the schools in the Oasis if they had the power; they didn't take the time to introduce or elaborate on the schools before hand, because A) it's not critical to understanding Wade, B) it's not critical to understanding just how invasive the Oasis has become, and C) it's not critical to the plot. \n\nAdditionally, when a book gets adapted, you bring in a whole array of creative people who have their own opinions on what the work means, and what it is capable of. For instance, Starship Troopers was adapted to film by a director who literally held the protagonists in utter contempt; he went into it directly looking to skewer and satire the Federation, playing up the pre-existing fascist elements to the point of putting Neil Patrick Harris in a pseudo-SS uniform. The Mist, meanwhile, had a director who liked what he saw in the original Steven King story, but wanted to crank it up another notch, resulting in an ending of remarkable brutality that King himself applauded as a quality change. \n\nFinally, there's the technical elements. One might not have the budget or technology to portray the world as-writ. A massive battle sequence may need to be trimmed down to a skirmish or excised entirely because you can't afford a couple of armies smashing into each other. Everyone and their uncle has an artificial gravity generator, because making everything float all the time is a massive pain in the ass when you shoot film in a gravity well. "},

There is also one paternal ancestor to whom we all trace back to in an unbroken paternal ancestry. The key word is unbroken. At the same time these ancestors were alive, they were alive thousands of years apart, there were other humans alive. We can all trace our ancestry back to nearly all of them.

{"title":"ELI5: Why does the LED on some chargers stay lit for a while after being unplugged from the mains?","question_detail":"","answer":"Chargers are \"direct current\" (DC) devices, meaning that they use a steady voltage like 5V to do their job. Mains is \"alternating current\" (AC), meaning that the voltage is seesawing back and forth between -120V and +120V sixty times a second (in North America anyway).\n\nMost circuits made for converting AC to DC use a capacitor at some stage to smooth out the voltage (there's a handful more parts involved but a capacitor is almost always part of the process).

We don’t even have to go straight to manufacturing/lab equipment. Restaurant supply store websites are fascinating for putting things into perspective. Household toaster - $15-30 ish. The conveyor toaster at my old job was around $700 (even a household conveyor toaster is about $60-80). Once you start talking about a conveyor toaster for industrial use, you can expect the price to increase at least 5 fold for a lower end machine.\n\nEquipment is built with amount of use in mind. A household toaster will generally be used a few times a day. \nThe restaurant toaster will run at least the length of service, or possibly even the whole business day.\nIndustrial toasters on a production line may have to be on for up to 24 hrs/day.\n\nLack of scale and build quality/materials quickly and easily increase the number of 0’s attached to the end of a price tag."},

","answer":"In systems that use both, the pump provides and abundance of pressure and the regulator takes the high pressure from the pump and lowers it to give the engine just the amount it needs. \n\nEngines require fuel, air, and fire in order to run.  The fuel and air need to be mixed in very specific ratios in order to run optimally, or even to run at all.  The regulator provides the engine the proper amount of fuel to mix with the incoming air in order to meet the throttle demand. \n\nA regulator is basically a valve, not too unlike a nozzle on a water hose. Just like twisting the nozzle on a water hose can increase or decrease the water pressure coming out the end, a fuel pressure regulator controls the pressure by allowing more or less fuel to pass through."},
{"title":"ELI5: Why does a gummy bear(or sasuage) works perfectly as a stylus for touchscreens?","question_detail":"","answer":"Capacitive touchscreens utilise the small amount of electrical current that your body naturally generates to work out where on the screen you have touched. Anything that can conduct an electrical signal and impart it on the screen will work fine. This is why using your skin works but your fingernail doesn't as well.\n\nAlso just for the record, jelly (or as Americans call it jello) shows enough electrical signals (\"brain activity\") that it wouldn't be able to be switched off on a life support system."},

{"title":"ELI5: How can you age more slowly than someone else based on your velocity?","question_detail":"I've tried to understand how this works and it doesn't compute in my brain.\n\nSo if light is constant (c)\n\nAnd time  = distance / speed\nAssuming you can't go faster than light\nTime should pass slowly for you as compared to an observed entity that is slower or stationary, right?\n\nBut why is it that in the background time just isn't progressing at the same speed.\n\nLike if someone is stood still the earth doesn't orbit the sun slower for them compared to someone who is flying around the earth on a jet for instance, it's the same earth... even though with moving faster you age more slowly?","answer":"&gt;Speed of time by physics standards is just what you read off a clock face. It's not really that specific, it's actually kind of vague and doesn't mention anything about where you read it from.\n\nBecause that's not time itself, it's just a measurement of time. This is like saying that space is just what you read off of a ruler. Don't mistake the actual quantity for how you measure it. \n\n&gt;Time doesn't really slow down though.\n\nYou're just saying this without any evidence. There *is* plenty of evidence for relativity, I've given you 7 actual physical examples in this world where the effects of time dilation were experienced.\n\nThe rest of the post is just a useless philosophical statement. Of course you can't be absolutely certain. You can't prove that the statement \"the universe was created right now\" to be wrong.\n\nBut that doesn't matter? Science is the act of constructing the best model we have of the physical world. That model is likely not completely accurate but that doesn't mean you shouldn't even bother. \n\n&gt;When we send a person to another star and they come back having aged less than us then I'll believe it beyond a shadow of a doubt\n\nAgain, there are literally many many examples of time dilation.

{"title":"ELi5:- Why do they disply a sold sign over a for sale sign rather than just take it down completly?","question_detail":"","answer":"It’s part advertising, part just in case. In Australia, most sales are either 30, 60 or 90 day settlements and coupled with finance and building and pest clauses, not all sales go through. You can, as a purchaser, crash a contract if you get a dodgy building and pest report or if you can’t get your finance together in the timeframe stated in the contract. Other clauses such can also rely on the purchaser selling their own house in the stated timeframe and if that doesn’t happen, that can crash it too. \n\nSo the agent can keep advertising the property, telling everyone how awesome they are, especially effective if they have multiple signs in the area and they have a safety net if the contract falls over. \n\nSource: in the industry "},

{"title":"ELI5: Is the following sentence makes sense?","question_detail":"I'm highschool student in South Korea. In exam we had descriptive problem. So is \"You can help people around you bacome smart shoppers who are not smart shoppers yet.\" makes sense?","answer":"That \"make\" is in its infinitive form, which means it hasn't been conjugated at all. We can change the question into a statement to make it easier to read: \"The following sentence does make sense.\"\n\n\"Does make\" is the verb phrase--\"does\" is the present-tense 3rd-person indicative conjugation of \"to do\", and \"make\" is infinitive.\n\n---------\n\nAs mentioned, OP's problem is that his subordinate clause is modifying the wrong noun. \"Who are not smart shoppers yet.\" is the subordinate clause, and \"who\" is the relative pronoun connecting the subordinate clause to the main sentence. In OP's post, \"who\" is connecting to \"smart shoppers,\" but it should be connecting to \"people around you.\"\n\nIn case you're curious, OP, what you wrote makes grammatical sense, but not pragmatic sense. There's nothing wrong with the grammar other than the fact that it doesn't convey the meaning that you want it to convey. In your sentence, you're helping people become smart shoppers who are simultaneously not yet smart shoppers, which is a pardox.\n\nHowever, 99.999% of readers would still understand what you were intending to say, so no big deal."},

{"title":"ELI5: How do Lightfields or Volumetric Captures work when used with VR technology?","question_detail":"Hello all,  My office is really excited about the potential something like Lightfields or Volumetric captures could give us .  To put it simply a Lightfield is like a 2D image that has depth to it meaning you can look at the angles of things based on how large the volume they were recorded in is .  \n\n\nMy very first actual  introduction to Lightfields was the  [Welcome To LightFields demo](https://store.steampowered.com/app/771310/Welcome_to_Light_Fields/) that google came out with for the HTC Vive some time earlier this year.   After several meeting on Light Field Arrays and Volumetric captures finally seeing one explained EVERYTHING!!!!! Wel....l Almost everything I've been working in and around the VR space for a while and the one part I don't understand is what am I seeing in the headset?  is It a 2D image sphere that updates on the positioning of my head within the Volume? I can't imagine all those frames are kept in memory to be loaded and unloaded so quickly with so much detail ... How do Light Fields actually render based on the users head position if they do so at all ?  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;","answer":"Thanks for the reference document , our studio prototypes a lit of things but essentially our goal is to provide high fidelity volumetric captures of interior spaces and that has been a challenging rabbit hole.

{"title":"ELI5: What is the difference between tanks and tank destroyers?","question_detail":"","answer":"For WWII  tanks have a rotating turret but a tank destroyers have a gun is a fixed casemate where you can turn the gun a few degrees to the sides.\n\nIn general tanks  have a turret with a few exceptions like early WW I tanks and Swedish Stridsvagn 103 from the 1960. Tank destroyed can have turret and the remaining variants used today have turret or used anti tank missiles. Turetless tank desultory have been used on on front line service in western into the 1990s if not longer\n\n\nA casemate is cheaper to produce  and can have a larger gun compared to what would fit in a turret.  You might also be able to add thicker front amour. The drawback is that you have to rotate the whole vehicle to aim the gun. It also gave you the opportunity to continue to use a old chassi for a longer time when it was to small for effective turret.  \n\nSo the idea is to have a cheaper vehicle  so you can have more of them. They are god at one thing but a lot worse at other so it is a compromise.\n\n\nThe main exception in WWII is US tank destroyers that have turrets or is a gun mounted on a half track or a Jeep. The US tank destroyer idea was a bit different then other countries. The idea was to create dedicated units you had in reserve and could move fast and destroy enemy armour that have broken trough the line. So the prioritized movement speed over armour. Other nation used there tank destroyed  on the frontline\n\n"},

She’s in her 20’s and I’m 16. We heart weird noises in the basement. We didn’t know what it could’ve been. We stood in the dining room for a minute, and I decided it was prob nothing, yet I was still a bit spooked. But, I was okay enough to go check and walk down stairs in the basement by myself bc I just wanted it to be the furnace and I just wanted to feel peace. So, I began to creep down, and I didn’t see anything. I calmed down so I walked over to the door, where I was something blocking the door. It was an object I have never seen, and my sister hasn’t recalled.  So, I was like, “hey why did u put this here?” In a joking but almost stupid sense because it’s not he first time they have put something against a door in the basement, but I was the door to the outside, the door to the outside room has a big sliding lock, where the rod was stuck under the door. Anyways, I asked if she did wedge it against the door, obviously expecting a yes. And at first it was a yes, until she realized what I was talking about. She saw it, knew neither me or her put t there. No other person in the house could’ve done this, we know for sure. And we know we did not wedge that.\nSo back to the story\nShe said hey, I didn’t put that there acting, come up here. In a panicked voice\nWe ran upstairs and woke her girlfriend up bc safety in numbers, also this girl is a hardcore strong as bitch, so it seems, and we trust her and we wanted her to be alert also. She continuously told us for hours we were crazy and it fell. (By the way the door latch was perfect. Nothing was messaged with. No one was down there. And then my sister started to calm down and realize everything was okay, because they cleared the whole house.but there is no logical explanation on how that thing got wedged in the door, and I would believe it was ghosts before I believe it fell. Sadly, we were)  in a panic and didn’t get photos. A lot of the night is a blur, I’ve been shaking for house, I finally started to calm a little bit ago tho.. but idk how to get to sleep. Idk how to calm myself. I feel like I won’t feel safe here again.  I need it explained to me like I’m five, how to calm the f down because nothing is clicking","answer":"[removed]"},

Flaired as Biology because it's about the body I suppose? ","answer":"It is to do with metabolic rate. There are a large number of different factors in this, but a few important ones are:\n\n\\- Age (younger people have higher metabolisms)\n\n\\- Body composition (those with a higher muscle mass have higher metabolisms, this also causes a disparity between males and females)\n\n\\- Activity level (the more active you are, the higher your metabolic rate will be)\n\nWhen you get older, your metabolic rate naturally slows (age), you start losing muscle mass as your body is being worn out and unable to maintain its composition (body) and naturally as health issues occur and mobility decrease you become less active too. \n\nAnother example is that men tend to feel warmer than women do at the same ambient temperature, which is why A/C is a big issue in offices! This is due to body composition, as women tend to have less muscle mass and more fat than males."},

You didn’t put it near anything really hot, but it still didn’t stay cold because the air in the room is warmer than the air in the fridge. The heat, or energy, in the room moved into the area with very little heat, the cold can. This makes the soda can warmer and the room a little colder, just not enough to feel. \n\nThe 2nd law of thermodynamics says that this will always happen. Energy always flows from a place of high energy to a place of low energy until the amount of energy is equal. Like if you have two containers that hold different amounts of water, and then you connect them, the water will flow from the fuller container to the less full container until the water levels are equal. \n\nRight now the universe is full of pockets of high and low heat, constantly trading energy back and forth. That’s what makes stars burn and planets spin and living things eat food and rain fall from the sky. But if that goes on long enough, everything will balance out. Everything will have exactly the same amount of energy in it as everything else, and it won’t be possible to transfer energy anymore. \n\nAt that point, the universe will be dead. Nothing will happen anymore, ever. Everything will be still and quiet, like a corpse in a coffin. \n\nNow, sweet dreams, young 5-year-old!"},

{"title":"ELI5: Why can we pick up small objects with the tip of our fingers by pressing on them?","question_detail":"","answer":"Your fingertips are covered with fluids - skin oil (known as sebum), sweat, ambient water.  These are all sticky.\n\nAdditionally, the grooves of your fingerprint can act similarly to suction cups on very flat, smooth surfaces, and additionally help spread your sebum out to maximize stickiness."},
{"title":"ELI5: How do people make those picture mosaics where the image is made up of hundreds of smaller, different versions of the same subject?","question_detail":"","answer":"Back in my embarrassing days, I made a picture of harry styles out of smaller images of harry styles - using mosaic software that worked like the simple one you described (it was a very tongue in cheek joke by the way, not an obsession thing). I downloaded many different pictures of harry styles that featured different colours, using google image's colour filter thing. (where you can filter for images that are very purple, or yellow, or black, etc)  \n\n\nThe downside was that the colours google gave (primary, secondary, and some others), didn't make up a good pool of pictures to choose from, because a lot of the colours in an image of a person are not simple colours. This lead to an overuse of particular images in areas like skin and hair - because I didn't specifically download enough images that featured those colours prominently. And overall, areas that weren't simple colours looked like choppy, poorly done pointilism. Not something nice to look at.   \n\n\nThe point of my story is that there's more to making mosaics than just the software that arranges the picture/pixels.  Selecting good images that cover enough of the colour palette of the image is vital to making the software produce decent mosaics. "},

{"title":"ELI5: How do blind/automatic/unthinking contributions to 401(k)s/403(b)s by employees and the companies they work for affect the stock market?","question_detail":"","answer":"Those contributions are sent to a broker company that invests that money on the employees behalf. This increases demand for stocks which in general drives stock prices up. Increased numbers of retirees selling stocks for living expenses has the opposite effect. Historically those brokers were actual people who bought and sold stocks like any other individual might choose to. In modern times, stock trading at those brokers is dominated by automatic, unthinking, machines which guide trades by scouring the internet for positive or negative key words with respect to a companies' stock. Trading by these machines amplifies market trends generated by their own behavior, causing increased market overreactions until a human intervenes to correct prices which in effect means more frequent stock market \"corrections\"."},

We also have different nerve paths carrying pain sensations. There are many times we do not want the reasoning brain involved in a pain decision (hand on a hot stove, for ex), so we have a reflex pathway as well (instant jerk off the stove). \n\nPain and its treatment is a big and fascinating subject worthy of an ELI 5, 12, 18, 22, 30, and 50. Did you know we still don’t have an objective pain scale? There’s no way to know whether my 5/10 pain is the same as yours.

To create an alloy changes the properties of a metal. Let's use iron as an example. Iron per se is quite a soft metal. Adding i.e. carbon to the chemical composition of iron (having a cristaline builtup) will increase its strenght and but also will it make brittle. Other metals like Chrome, Titan or Tungsten will create different effects."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why are there distinct different species when evolution is a slow, gradual process?","question_detail":"Basically that ^ Why do we see clear different species in nature and in fossils when evolution happens very little by little, without any major changes at once? ","answer":"We see evolution happening in the real world but it would be difficult to reflect that in the fossil record.\n\nHere's an anecdotal example. There's a type of bird, I think they were swallows, that naturally nests in cliff sides and such. When humans changed the landscape, they started nesting in human structures that resemble cliff sides as well. For example in the sides of bridges.\n\nHere's the thing though, when those birds dropped down from those bridges to fly away, they'd drop straight into traffic and a lot of them got killed by trucks. The ones that survived were the ones with smaller wings that allowed them to make sharper turns and avoid traffic more easily.\n\nIt's still the same species of bird but natural selection made sure that their wings are now a lot smaller than they were before human construction changed the landscape. In fact, cliff dwelling populations and bridge dwelling populations of the same bird have distinctly different wing sizes. Eventually bridge and cliff populations might diverge to the point where they'd be considered separate species.\n\nWhat you're seeing in the fossil record and in nature today are species who have had far more time to diverge from each other through evolution. You can still see the traces though.[ If you look at a whale skeleton for instance](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/godzilla/images/7/7e/Whale_skeleton.jpeg/revision/latest?cb=20160430020649), you can still see how it has the remnants of hip bones and it's fins still contain hand and finger bones. The whale had much more time to diverge from it's land dwelling ancestors so it looks radically different, but the clues to it's ancestry are still there."},

He talks about his recovery from lyme disease by doing physical activity that put his mind into the flow state. This prompted him to study the \"flow state\" ever since.  He notes that entering flow once a day helps keep our minds sharp. \n\nIf I still have your attention I'll also add that 20 minutes of any physical activity puts you into flow.

{"title":"ELI5 Why is it so hard for smartphone manufacturers to make a bezel less display?","question_detail":"","answer":"It's down to the display technology. LCD is hard to work with, because as a display, it is relatively thick as a panel. Why does this matter? because the thicker the display, the less room for the side to have for things like buttons, or other objects, and more room required for the display to stick into.   \nOLED, and AMOLED require ribbon cables mounted inline to the board. For example, how Apple overcame this issue, is that they had folded the OLED panel. (See:[iPhone X Promo Image](https://boygeniusreport.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/iphone-x-display-fold.jpg?quality=98&amp;strip=all&amp;w=782)) Either they have to build a larger OLED panel and curve it over,(not bezel-less) or leave it with a chin. On top of that, every phone needs a front facing camera, a speaker, and usually a brightness sensor. Now the phone has to have a notch for a camera, speaker, and sensors.

We have random road-side drug testing the same as random breath testing for alcohol consumption. Our BAC limit is 0.05 for example, what is the ‘limit’ for marijuana levels in countries it is legalized? I hope this question makes sense. ","answer":"In Germany it is a blood serum THC concentration of 1ng/mL. Uruguay have the limits at any detectable levels. A Canadian draft suggests a limit at 2ng/mL. In the US the limits are currently at a urine THC concentration of 50ng/mL or 15ng/mL depending on the test being conducted. However states can set this lower so Colorado and Washington have blood limits at 5ng/mL and Nevada at 2ng/mL. However even if there is no defined limit for a drug you can still be convicted of driving under the influence if you are unable to properly operate your vehicle. The limits for both marijuana and alcohol is more of guides for those drugs to help the police and judges in their work. There are still more general laws that catch any drug that impairs your ability to drive safely including marijuana and alcohol."},

{"title":"ELI5: why do women get incredibly sad and depressed around the time of their peruods?","question_detail":"","answer":"Hormones have powerful effects on the brain. Estrogen is a stimulant and can give you a feeling of well-being, happiness, and energy. It’s at its highest point at ovulation, and then it gradually decreases and to its lowest point at the beginning of your period, which can cause some women to feel a little down. Testosterone is similar in its trajectory and effect on mood. Progesterone is low during this time, too. When menstruation starts, progesterone has also bottomed out. Progesterone relaxes you, can curb anxiety, and can help you sleep. At its lowest you might feel more anxious and have trouble sleeping. So the combination of all of these hormonal effects may mean some mood changes for a woman. It’s only a certain percentage of women who have PMS—it’s by no means the norm. It affects some women more than others, and could affect some more at some times than others. Like if you are already stressed, this is going to impact the ways your body deals with stress and may increase stress. "},
{"title":"ELI5: Will eating a multivitamin everyday keep me relatively healthy, even if my diet is not that great?","question_detail":"They provide all my essential vitamins so why would this not work to some extent?","answer":"Yeah, the dosing of folate is fine.  The risks for excessive folate are very low, unless you are taking extra folate pills with prenatal vitamins, then eating folate enriched foods in addition tot hat.  My advice for \"women of child-bearing age\" is from a mishap prevention standpoint.  ~50% of all pregnancies in the US are not planned.  Some of these people are just not being careful at all.  But a lot of these people are using forms of contraception and get pregnant anyhow.  Sometimes single women or lesbian women end up pregnant after being subjected to sexual violence, and choose to keep the pregnancy.\n\nIUDs do not increase absolute risk of ectopic pregnancy.  But, of pregnancies that occur with women who have IUDs, a higher proportion of those pregnancies will be ectopic, just because they are so effective at preventing intrauterine pregnancy."},
{"title":"ELI5: why remove scar tissue if it replaces damaged muscle?","question_detail":"If scar tissue replaces structure to damaged muscles, wouldnt massaging it away be bad? ","answer":"Muscles are the best at what they do, expand and contract in a linear fashion \"&lt;==&gt; or =&gt;&lt;=\". With that said. We must first understand what scar tissue is. \" Scars are adhesions on tissue in the body that form after trauma and can affect skin, muscles, ligaments and tendons.\".  Which is great and all but they have a Downfall. Scar tissue is unorganized \"the new fibers align themselves in a random, mismatched formation.\".\n\nNow that we talked about what scar tissue is and how it's formed let's think about how it is inferior to the original muscle. I like using images to help explain what is better and what is worse. So let's look at this picture 'https://bodyworksmassagechch.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/scar.jpg'\n\nOn the left most image of the three we see a muscle, Healthy with blood and nerves. The second image shows an injury, nothing too damaging it seems however the repairs. Well let's look at the repairs. The last image shows NOTHING that is equal to image number one. It looks unorganized, who knows where the blood vessel is located let alone the nerves. But that's not the end. We see barely any muscle tissue.\n\nAs explained in my first paragraph the scar tissue is just random. The picture representation (i used a pg-13 source) of what happens shows us damage and repair and because of this knowledge we therefore want to remove as much of that random scar tissue to restore as much of that original muscle and it's movement as possible.\n\nAnd the last thing to remember is that muscle damage is not a single line like this 'l' it's more often just random '€' so taking care of damaged muscle is important. Removing unwanted excess scar tissue to make the muscle look as close to the best version of itself is important.\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: How come the porcelain part of a spark plug break glass easily?","question_detail":"","answer":"The side windows of cars are made from tempered glass, similar to phone screens. This type of glass is extremely hard to break - there are videos of people trying and failing to break windows with sledgehammers. There's also a video by the YouTuber SmarterEveryDay where he shoots bullets at tempered glass drops, and the only thing that shatters on impact is the bullet.\n\nWhat you need to break a window like that is a huge force contentrated on a small point. But it's enough if that force just lasts for a split second on impact, just enough to start a microscopic crack. This crack will then quickly spread throughout the window and shatter the entire thing. The easiest way to generate such a force is to use a very hard material, harder than regular steel. For example window smashers in buses and trains use a very hard metal spike, something like tungsten carbide. You can also use a centerpunch, which is designed to punch dents into a piece of steel before drilling holes.\n\nThe ceramic material from spark plugs are also extremely hard, which is why they work for breaking windows.

{"title":"ELI5: Why America would want to make Puerto Rico a state and why do Puerto Ricans feel like they are entitled to it?","question_detail":"I know they're considered citizens but can't vote. They just had a massive hurricane and  this seems like a bail out. Why would Americans want to take that on? I know they're citizens but can't America just give them their country back and revoke citizenship. Do they pay taxes? I'm very confused","answer":"They pay *some* taxes, but are exempt from many of the US Federal income taxes, most of the time. Local taxes are up to them. They do not pay those taxes *because* they cannot vote and America was founded on the whole \"No taxation without representation\" thing.\n\nAmerica might *want* to make Puerto Rico a full state because then they would no longer be exempt from those federal income taxes. Yay! More money for the US!\n\nExcept they would also then qualify for a lot more federal aid dollars. It's *very* certain that it would cost the US way more in aid than in taxes (as it already does with the current level of aid and taxes). Puerto Rico would benefit more from this, because they would get more benefits than they're getting now and, frankly, the money just doesn't exist in Puerto Rico for Federal income taxes to take. So they get a better deal out of it.\n\nThe US doesn't want to just dump Puerto Rico for a couple reasons. A great reason is that Puerto Rico is a fantastic tourist destination, especially for Americans because you don't need a passport to go there. So while their taxes are limited, they're still generating income and helping the American economy as a whole. They also can't really give Puerto Rico back to their own country because they haven't been their own country for hundreds of years, since Spain took it. So it's not like it would be going back to the natives, it would be going back to a hodgepodge of native blood, Spanish blood, American blood, African slave blood, and whatever else mixed in.\n\nDoes that mean they can't govern themselves and become their own country anyway? No, but again, they don't have a lot of money and they generate a lot of income for the island because of (mainland) American tourism, which would drop significantly if suddenly you needed a passport to get there. So they don't really have a strong incentive to secede.\n\nHawaii has similar incentives to stay in the US, despite the many natives that dislike the US and would prefer to be independent again.\n\nWith communist Cuba right there, we like having Puerto Rico as part of our sphere of influence in the Caribbean and we *don't* like the idea of Cuba getting all chummy with Puerto Rico if we leave.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, they're Americans, and have been for almost 200 years. It would be morally reprehensible for the US to just say, \"Well, we don't really care about you as citizens, so...we're getting rid of you.\n\nSo they're in this political and economic grey area where they benefit from being a part of the US, but not as much as if they were a state. They value their independence, such as it is, and fear the increased control the US federal government would have over them if they become a proper state. They also fear having to pay additional taxes that they can't afford. On the other hand, they might get more benefits and be better off. On the other other hand, they would become even more dependent on the US. The US benefits from having them as a territory, but not enough to be worth making them a state. So it wouldn't be super beneficial to the country to make them a state, except maybe with better infrastructure, they might grow as an economy and become a good investment.\n\nSo the argument goes back and forth and back and forth and the US allows them the option to become a state and vote on it, but *really* doesn't encourage the vote to happen or encourage the citizens to vote in favor of it, which of course discourages citizens so they *don't* vote in favor of it, except they would almost certainly benefit from it so they kind of also really do want to become a state so the idea never really goes away.\n\nBut mostly, the people in Puerto Rico are just living their lives and are as politically savvy as anyone else in the US - which is to say, not very - and most *probably* don't care enough either way to make a decision. The same is true of many mainland US citizens, many of whom wrongly believe that Puerto Rico isn't part of the US, or already is a state, and don't care enough to figure out which it is, much less have an opinion on which is *should* be."},

However the beam hitting earth near the equator covers a smaller area on the surface than the beam hitting the northern hemisphere.

I also don't eat that much of a varied diet - yet I've always been healthy and feel great.\n\nAlso, most people don't measure what and how much of it they eat and get nutritionally speaking, and they're completely fine, even if they eat the same things fairly often.\n\n How is that possible?","answer":"Thanks everyone for your replies! I think I understand it a lot better now."},
{"title":"ELI5: What are and how effective are sabermetrics, and can they be applied to other sports?","question_detail":"","answer":"I would say that the issue with sabermetrics not being allocable to other sports is not with the pace if the game, but rather the amount of games.\n\nThe sheer number of games that baseball teams play dwarfs other popular sports. Baseball season is ober 160 games. By contrast, the NFL (16), NBA (82), NHL (82), and MLS (34) are all very short seasons. Also, as a result of this, MLB teams play each other much more often than other sports (usually 6 times a year). So why does this matter? It isnt necessarily more data, but rather over more games a statistical advantage will eventually overshadow luck. In moneyball (about the beginings of sabermetrics in probaseball), there is a qoute tot the effect of \"In any given game skill is going to score you 1 extra run, and luck will generally give you +/- 3\" (I probably have numbers wrong but its the idea). The fact is that in any single game, a lucky hit, a good call, or any other unknowable factor can lead to a win or lose. Over the course of 100 games however, luck will basically even out and that one extra run per game will come into play and lead to more wins. This becomes a big issue in sports (especially the NFL where you only have 16 games). There isnt enough time for luck to even out, and a few good calls in the toughest matchups may not be offset, or vice versa. \n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: Why was frame rate tied to physics in the past, and how is it separated now?","question_detail":"For example: Why was it tied in Super Mario 64, and how do modern games with unlocked frame rates not break physics?","answer":"The simple way to do physics is assume that each frame takes the same time.\n\nSo for example if you have a character moving at 3 m/s, and your game runs at 30fps, then you add 0.1 m to the character's position each frame. That's really simple, and it was fine for old console games that ran at a consistent framerate.\n\nBut if the fps does drop then the character will move in slow motion because the game is still assuming 1/30th of a second has passed since the last frame. You can fix this by scaling the physics calculations by the actual time passed since the last frame.\n\nThis is better, but the results of the calculations can still vary depending on the framerate due to numerical inaccuracy. There are various ways to avoid this such as by doing multiple physics \"steps\" each frame instead of just one.\n\nThe truth is I don't think there are many games where the physics is *completely* independent of framerate. Chances are the results will vary slightly depending on the framerate, particularly for extremely high or extremely low framerates. Some games are more accurate than others though."},

What gives? ","answer":"Besides potential differences in humidity, a big factor is wall temperature. Your AC or heater might keep the air temperature stable, but outside walls are usually warmer or colder than that. Through a heat transfer mechanism called radiation, you might be radiating your body heat to the colder walls, or vice versa, absorbing heat from the walls even if the indoor air temperature is the same.

{"title":"ELI5: Why do thunderstorms and rain seem to occur much more frequently in the early/late afternoon rather than at night or in the morning?","question_detail":"","answer":"If i remember correctly, thunderstorms form when a cold cloud falls on a warm cloud. Because cold air sinks and warm air rises they squish together.  Singe warm air holds more moisture than cold air, that extra water gets taken up in the new cloud that cant hold as much liquid as the warm cloud. This entire process is easier to accomplish when temperatures are changing because not all the air will heat evenly. However, in the early morning/day theres either not enough warm air thats saturated or the air is so evenly heated that theres not enough cold air which is why storms more often happen in later afternoon.

These allow you to tighten your laces to suit the terrain and achieve maximum comfort.\n\nYou can tighten laces into ‘zones’ that suit the ascent stage of your walk vs the descent.  The standard eyelets towards the bottom of the boot is zone 1 and should be tighter than the locking hooks (zone 2) for ascents, which should be loosened for better freedom of movement.

{"title":"ELI5: What is the difference between practicing extended fasts and having an eating disorder?","question_detail":"I follow r/fasting and it seems like a lot of weight loss photos are posted. If weight loss is the purpose, what makes fasting different than starving oneself from anorexia?","answer":"Also, from my limited clinical experience (as a closed ward psychologist), eating disorder is reinforced by the self harm high that comes from starving your body. It’s a high that is stronger than the one from tool-based self harm (cutting). So starving yourself when you’re distressed helps against emotional pain, but can turn into an obsession that is hard to break in your own.\n\nVoluntary fasting is not is primarily about self harm and the person fasting can stop if it goes out of hand. \n\nMany people who fast describe the positive feelings during some parts of the fast, but not all who try this get hooked on that feeling. \nAnorexia is also about thought patterns and all that stuff, but I focused on only one aspect in this answer. Also, I’m not sure if this is an explanation that other clinicians subscribe to, but merely my observations and thoughts."},

How is this not an impossible \"free lunch?\" \n\n2: Also, what does it mean to say that energy is \"released\" during a fission (or fusion) reaction? I don't understand precisely what this means. One expert tried to explain it to me a little, but he's been already far too generous with his time, so I wonder if you guys could help. I asked him the following: \n\n&gt;The claim is that 200 MeV is \"released\" per fission. But how much of that 200 MeV is \"used up\" in splitting the two nucleus-halves apart and overcoming the forces that bind the halves together? It sounds like *more* than 200 MeV is released, but that 200 MeV is the *net* energy that is \"released\" after the work of the splitting has been done.\n\nHe responded: \n\n&gt;Almost all of the energy is in the form of those two repelling fission fragments (the \"halves\"). They're like two positively charged cannonballs. They then bang into other things, transferring that energy (as, say, heat). There is also some energy released in the form of radiation (neutrons, gammas, X-rays, even a couple neutrinos). But most of it is kinetic. I agree that there is a lot of confusion in talking about how the energy is \"released\" — it makes people think it is like a little lightning bolt, but it's mostly kinetic energy on a subatomic scale.","answer":"yep, my bad. Rechecked the source, and its actually  the energy per unit mass, not per event. This is 0.7MeV for fission and 6.2MeV for fusion. "},

Is there a maximum number of calories your body can consume in one day and then the rest is eliminated as waste?","question_detail":"For example, if you were to gorge yourself at an all-you-can-eat buffet, would all of those calories be taken in by the body and used/stored? Or do you reach a maximum where the body can’t consume the calories and it goes down the toilet? ","answer":"There are lots of half-right answers here.\n\nThere is not a limit on the number of calories your body can consume, and any excess calories you absorb will be stored as fat--but your body is not 100% efficient at digesting food, and the kind of food matters to determining how many calories are actually absorbed.  \n\nFor example, [there is evidence](http://www.berkeleywellness.com/healthy-eating/food/article/are-nut-calorie-counts-wrong) that if you eat almonds, your body only absorbs about  75% of the calories in them, and the remaining 25% of the calories get pooped out. But if you drank sugar water, your body would absorb basically 100% of the calories, because no digestion is necessary.  \n\nI don't know that anyone has ever studied it, but it's reasonable to think that if you ate as many almonds as you could possibly consume it might overwhelm your digestive system's abilities and shift the percentage of calories being consumed vs. excreted. That is, if you eat 500 calories of almonds, you absorb about 375 calories (75%); but if you eat 50,000 calories in almonds perhaps you would only absorb 25,000 (50%).  But, if you ate 50,000 calories in glucose syrup, your body would probably absorb all 50,000 calories ( and suffer all kinds of terrible side effects from doing so)."},

Scaling that up or developing alternate propulsive methods that can achieve similar speeds for human-capable spacecraft is many decades if not centuries away. It is pretty mind boggling though that in our lifetimes, depending on how old you are, we could see the first images of another solar system taken from that system, If you figure 15 years to develop, a 20 year trip, and 4.3 years for the return signal, that's as soon as \\~40 years from now, although that's probably a bit optimistic."},
{"title":"ELI5: How did we discover other solar systems and such?","question_detail":"I have really never undestood this and it really fascinates me.","answer":" Astronomy isnt something very recent stuff.  \nThe  sky and the heavens have been looked up for centuries and admired by  humans. The greeks,the Babylonians, the Egyptians,Ancient Indians and  many civilisations had devised methods of calcilating positions of the  planets,prediction of their next citings,comets,etc.  \n\n\nAnd believe me,recognising the common stuff in the heavens isnt that difficult.   \nFor  eg. A very basic fact is stars are luminous whereas planets are not.  Planets are illuminated by the light of a star, falling on them which is  very much the same reason why the moon shines with very less amount of  light compared to the sun.  \n\n\nNow our atmosphere helps us alot while identifying the difference between planets and stars by making stars twinkle :D  \nStars  are very very distant objects and hence appear dim. The molecules or  constituents of the atomosphere due to continuous motion scatter the  weak incoming light. Hence whenever you can see a star twinkle, it is  because a part of its light was scattered for a while.Also being very  distant,stars move very slowly and can be said to be fixed in the sky.  \nPlanets  on the other hand are nearer to us and hence light coming from them is  comparitively brighter than stars , and being powerfull the twinkling  effect is far less, thus making them appear like a small daimond studded  in night sky. Also planets being very near to us traverse the night sky  very much fastert than stars. This can be easily observed if you watch  the night sky for roughly 20 days or so.  \n\n\nAnd just think, if you or I can do this in 20days, then offcourse scientists out there have been doing it for years,  \nOur  ancestors had been doing it for their whole lives, and humanity was  doing it for centuries, are we so dumb that we cannot try to give the  motions a mathematical model? Off course not! We have gravitational law,  relative motion concepts , quiet decent math, good observation skills  ,its usage these tools that helped us reach where we are today. "},

{"title":"ELI5: How do seeds work in PC games?","question_detail":"I've been seeing a lot of random world type games like Minecraft or RimWorld.  I've just been puzzled by how these things work, and how you can affect them.  Minecraft uses a number system, while RimWorld uses full words (Like the passwords in Fallout 3/NV) I've played around with the word ones, but IDK if they'll accept anything, or if it just chooses a random default.","answer":"Former game developer here,\n\nSo you're talking about random number generators. There are two types - true random, and pseudo-random.\n\nTrue random uses hardware to generate numbers. The most common type is a noisy diode. A diode is a semiconductor component that allows current to flow one direction, but not the other. They can screw with these things where it kinda doesn't want to flow in the forward direction, either. Instead, you get random jolts forward, like a jittery short circuit. You can use this to your advantage - if you *sample* the circuit, like you sample audio, you take a measurement off the wire at a given frequency, and you'll find that it's either carrying a current, or it's not. And you can use that for your bits! Random binary digits! The drawback is that these are speed limited, and being truly random, you can't reproduce the random number sequence it makes, which is sometimes, and in our case, a useful property.\n\nA pseudo-random number generator uses an algorithm that is a number of mathematical operations that aren't reversible, they also happen to produce number sequences you can't predict without calculating the sequence. The repeatability is useful for crypto and video games. Why do I have to store all this game world data when I only need to store a single value and I can generate the whole sequence from there?\n\nSo if you're going to generate pseudo-random numbers, you need to start with a number. That's the seed. You can just pick something, like 7, or you can try to get something kinda random-ish to start. Whatever number you pick, so long as you use the same algorithm, you'll always get the same sequence. So how do you pick a starting seed? Typically, we use time. Time on your computer is stored as a large integer, and it's always marching forward, so your seed is always going to be unique from one starting seed to the next. Time itself, by the way, makes a very poor random number because you know each time you look at it, the number only ever gets bigger, and it's very predictable.\n\nNow what do we do with random numbers? This gets a bit technical, but we use a technique called procedural generation. This is where content isn't created by people, but by programs. The best example I can think of is if you've ever played Dungeons and Dragons. The game has lots of tables for all sorts of stuff, and you can use dice to roll a random row on that table. Hm, what sort of monster should I attack you with? :Rolls dice: 37. What's row 37? Ah, Ancient Red Dragon. That's how the game world is produced. It gets more elaborate than that, of course, but it comes down to stuff like that.\n\nAnd so long as I know what seed you started with, I can use that sequence to produce the same procedures in the same order to produce the same content every time. So all the details of the game world don't need to be stored. If anything, the game can produce your game world, and it only needs to store the difference from the generated content to how it's been changed through gameplay, which is typically a lot less information than, say, the properties of every single block in Minecraft."},

{"title":"ELI5: What’s the difference between Xbox One, Xbox One X, Xbox One S and Project Scorpio?","question_detail":"","answer":"Like many console manufacturers, Microsoft has made different versions of their console to go after different segments of the market.  It's kind of like the same model car can have different features; one version may have leather seats and a sunroof, another version may have cloth seats and an upgraded stereo, and another version may have a bigger engine.  \n\nThe Xbox One was the first console, and for the purposes of this conversation, it should serve as the baseline reference point.  In many ways it's like the stock model of a car.  \n\nThe Xbox One S followed the Xbox One and featured small improvements like 4k output and HDR.  It also had a smaller form factor, and was often sold at a cheaper price.  This was possible because as the Xbox One hardware got older, it was cheaper for Microsoft to buy and assemble the parts.  Think of the Xbox One S as the version of the Xbox One with leather seats and an upgraded stereo; it wasn't a ton better, but it had some nice features.  \n\nThe Xbox One X was a pretty substantial leap from the Xbox One and the One S.  It featured much more powerful processors and more memory.  It still plays the same games that you can play on the other two systems, but it can do so with better graphics and/or higher frame rates.  In car terms, it had the same luxury features as the S, but it also included a turbocharged engine and sporty suspension.  \n\nProject Scorpio was just an internal codename for Xbox One X.  It's what developers called the One X before the name was officially revealed.  For all intents and purposes, Scorpio and X are the same thing. "},

{"title":"ELI5: What's the problem with curing cancer?","question_detail":"","answer":"Cancer is effectively cell-division gone crazy.  There are so many different ways for that to occur -- radiation, chemical exposure, and genetic factors are common causes.  \n\n\nThe primary reason cancer is so hard to treat is because each person's cancer has a unique pattern of genetic changes, but those changes are not always consistent in an individual: as a cancer spreads, more and more changes occur, and even in the same tumor the cancerous cells may have different genetic changes.  Thanks to those variations, no single treatment method is effective against all types of cancer, so while chemotherapy (for example) may knock down *most* of the cancerous cells, it won't necessarily get *all* of them*.*  \n\n\nAlso, as others have pointed out, many cancer treatments are often more damaging than the disease itself, so many patients choose to employ less-effective (but safer) treatments until the concern over causing further damage becomes irrelevant."},

I'm not saying the brain is digital.  I'm just saying that at least one step (ganglionic to brain) is digital because they are action potentials.    \n\n\nWhen i say \"what your eye sees\" I am referring to the signals along the optic nerves after visual processing in your retina has occurred.  Your eye does visual processing through the various cells in the retina (horizontal, amacrine, bipolar, ganglionic).  The ganglion cells receive inputs from multiple lines of neurons and integrates them together to form an action potential.  The brain interprets these action potentials and uses this to \"see\".  To say that the eye is just the data collection device completely misses the point that the retina (which is actually part of the brain) has lower-level visual processing capabilities."},
{"title":"ELI5: How do mirrors work?","question_detail":"","answer":"Basic stuff first: when light hits something, the light is either absorbed or reflected. If the light is absorbed, the item looks darker, because less light comes back to your eyes. Mirrors work in the opposite way, reflecting as much light back as possible. The minimum basic requirement for a mirror is a smooth surface. When light reflects off a rough surface, the light bounces off in lots of directions. When it's a smooth surface, light just bounces off in the expected direction. Mirrors have been around for centuries via people using polished rocks or still water. Ever notice how clear your reflection is in calm water compared to rippling water? That's the smooth surface in action. Modern mirrors have a layer of glass on the outside with a thin sheet of reflective metal on the inside. The metal sheet essentially just makes the mirror better. The glass layer on the outside is smooth, and allows light to reflect more clearly. If you want to test it, just consider why a scratched up mirror doesnt give you as clear of a view. \n\nTL;DR smooth stuff is reflective because light bounces like a ball against a wall. Rough stuff is not because it bounces in a lot of random directions"},

{"title":"ELI5: How do PIDs work?","question_detail":"","answer":"Imagine you have one of those doors that can swing open to both sides, and you want to make a mechanism that closes it.  You can add a spring between the door and the frame, which will apply a force to the door proportional to the difference between the current position of the door and the closed position, which we call the ‘P’ action since it is proportional. Now the door closes, but it doesn’t stop at the closed position, it swings open to the other side, and back again. We want the door to stop moving. This can be achieved by adding a damper, which applies a force on the door proportional to the velocity of the door, which is the derivative of the position, which is why we call this ‘D’ action. We now have a PD-comtroller, which closes the door and stops it from moving. Now imagine the frame of the door was placed on a slope, and has a tendency to open a bit to one side due to gravity. If we want the door to fully close, we will have to use ‘I’ action, which stands for integral. You can best imagine this as a sensor that measures the distance between the door and the closed position, which sends this information to a small computer that integrates it over time, which in turn drives a motor that applies a force to the door. The integral part here basically means that if there is a gap between the door and the closed position, the motor will apply a force to the door which increases over time until the gap is closed.\n\nCombine both a ‘P’ , ‘I’  and ‘D’ action and you have a PID-controller."},

I used to train dogs and have a little knowledge on the issue. i would first highly recommend the national geographic article (and documentaries out there) on the domestication of the fox. they show you exactly the process of how domestication works over generations of breeding. \n\nThere are different classifications of animals, from completely domesticated to semi-domesticated . most fully domesticated animals undergo  genetic or behavioral changes from their wild ancestors.  this of course happens over long periods of time. the list of domesticated animals is fairly short compared to the \"semi domesticated\" animals. \n\nsimply put when any wild animal is caught and then bred in captivity, after a few generations of offspring they can often be \"trained\" to become more tame when provided a constant food source and reasonable safe living space. but of course its very specific to the animal. its one thing to tame a bird, and another thing to catch killer whales and try to breed them to perform for instance.  some animals were domesticated long ago and we dont know how it happened over centuries, some have been \"domesticated\" in the modern era and you can look into specifics. like with the fox as i mentioned."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why do people with a penis get erections in their sleep when they need to urinate?","question_detail":"","answer":"I understand where you are coming from, but the thing is - you still confuse the terminology a bit (well, because as of right now there really isn't any official terminology).\n\nThere *are* no such thing as a female with a penis. It does not exist no matter how much someone says they identify as such. It simply does not exist - *biologically*.\n\nBut identification is something completely else. It is simply what someone feel like. In a way, maybe think of it less as your gender and more as a style. Like, you can have that surfer dude style, or hippie style, or be a punker. You wouldn't say \"oh, but there are so many styles, when do we draw a line?\", because that does not make any sense to do for this. It is simply a way of describing certain aesthetically traits of a person and if people start having new aesthetically traits a new style is created.\n\nThis is in a way the same. Not saying a trangender is just a \"style\", but it is an identification - a mental thing. Not a biological one. Like style tells you something about a person, so does identification. \n\n&gt;There has to be a line drawn somewhere, sometime, eventually.\n\nWell, I don't think so. What there need to be is (as I've mentioned already) terminology. Basically what is called \"sex and gender distinction\" needs to be known.\n\nIn a way I wish we could just strip it down to man and woman being purely a way to describe what biological sex you are. Then use other words for your \"gender\", what you identify as. Like how you can be a \"man\" and a \"punker\". It is two different things about a person. But biological sex and identification is just too closely related due to historical reasons for it to work right now."},
