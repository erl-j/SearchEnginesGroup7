{"title":"ELI5: why does the US spend so much money on military?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"To look at why we spend so much now, we need to look back on why we started. In the years leading up to the US involvement in World War 2, we started rapidly spending money on creating a modern military capable of fighting a modern war involving aircraft carriers, tanks, airplanes, and so on. Once the war ended, the US and new Western allies were now facing a hugely militarized Soviet Union. Thus began the Cold War, with two global superpowers facing each other down. That led to an arms race, with each superpower trying to out-spend and out-perform the other.\n\nThis in turn led to the creation of what Eisenhower warned us of as the \"Military-Industrial Complex\", a close interconnected set of allegiances between the military, suppliers of military hardware, and the Congressional committees in charge of military spending. Military bases and suppliers create jobs in congressional districts, so those members want tax money flowing to them to keep the workers employed and voting for them. The military wants the latest and best hardware, and corporations want to make a profit. Corporations lobby Congress and the military hard to get those precious contracts."},

With fewer actors, you can't so easily film two episodes simultaneously: with a larger ensemble cast, this is much easier. Also, British actors are expected to be involved with other projects as well, so they're not available all the time. (The last-minute casting of Michael J Fox in *Back to the Future* caused a lot of headaches for the makers of the sitcom he was starring in at the time, *Family Ties*.)\n\nShorter and fewer series also have the advantage that the show is less likely to run out of ideas or \"jump the shark\". In fact, it's widely expected of British writers that they wrap up the show before this happens.\n\nThere have been some exceptions, though: the world's longest-running sitcom was the British *Last of the Summer Wine*, which ran for 295 episodes in 31 series, with only one cast member appearing for the entire run. Although it continued to be popular, it was often criticized in its later years for a decline in quality as it struggled to attract new audiences."},

So it is at its densest just slightly above the freezing point. So up to a point, the colder water gets, the more dense it gets. When you have fluids of various densities interacting, the denser fluid (because it has a stronger force of gravity pulling on it) will sink and the less dense fluid will rise."},

I don't \"need\" chapters or a \"jump to x time\" feature at all, but it seems weird no one's tried either yet. Is it just because they're leaving well-enough alone, or is there something else I didn't consider?","answer":"On a DVD/blu-ray it takes time to jump say 50 minutes into a movie (a lot of fast forwarding) so chapters are easy ways to pick up in the general time vicinity. On streaming services you can just slide the time to wherever you want.\n\nFor example; watching Pulp Fiction on DVD, I want to see Mia and Vincent dance at JRS, instead of fast forwarding 42 minutes into the movie I just pick the chapter closest to that point. On Netflix, I can just slide to where they pull in. "},
{"title":"ELI5: Subnetting","question_detail":"Hi! So for the sake of this ELI5, let's assume I have an understanding of the fundamentals of TCP/IP, binary arithmetic and that slash notion indicates where the network portion ends and host portion begins; the concept of subnetting just isn't falling into place. Can anyone ELI5 and clear it up? Thanks!\n","answer":"OK, your basis of knowledge makes this fairly simple to explain. The purpose of subnetting is to allow us to use more IP addresses than is really possible, and to segment networks so they aren't directly connected for various reasons - mainly, security (forcing the traffic to pass through another device, like a firewall) and to reduce traffic (broadcasts will normally not pass across subnets).\n\nA lot of that first portion, allowing us to use more IPs than is normally possible, is accomplished through the use of the private subnets. 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16. Anyone can use these and be assured that there won't be a conflict with an external IP address that is also using it somewhere on the internet. Though you may run in to an issue when connecting two private networks together, but that's another discussion.\n\nSo, how do we make a subnet? Well, an IP address is made up of 4 octets, X.X.X.X, right? The reason those are called octets and they only go up to 255 each is that they actually represent 8 binary digits each. So, if written in binary, the whole range of IP addresses is actually:\n\n00000000.00000000.00000000.00000000\n\nto\n\n11111111.11111111.11111111.11111111\n\nAs you can see, that's actually 32 digits long. That's where the slash way of writing a subnet comes in - you are writing a slash at what digit is the last one in the subnet - after that, it's all hosts.\n\nNow, say you have a company and you want to segment out different subnets there. First, you'll have a device that works as a router to the internet - commonly a firewall. It has a port with your external IP, and a port on your internal subnet, and passes traffic back and forth between them. Firewalls these days can easily be set up as a router, but something else internally may be doing your routing (maybe a firewall, maybe a router, maybe a layer 3 switch). That's not important for this discussion - we're going to talk about how the subnetting happens.\n\nYour company wants to divide up in to multiple subnets - maybe for different sites, different floors in your building, different departments, segmenting out server vs end user traffic, whatever. Here's what's happening behind the scenes. Say you've decided to use portions of the private 172.16.0.0/12 subnet for your internal networks. It's very common to subnet around the octets (though not necessary) so we'll use that as an example. Actually, let's not use that as an example because it might make it easier to understand. Let's say you've decided to split 172.16.1.0 between two floors of your building - floor A gets the first half, 172.16.1.0-172.16.1.127, and floor B gets the second half, 172.16.1.128-172.16.1.255. (side note - though there are 128 possibilities in each range, two of them are reserved - the lowest one for the definition of the range, and the highest one for the broadcast address - anything sent to that gets sent to the whole range. So in actuality these ranges only have 126 usable addresses in them.) These would be written as 172.16.1.0/25 and 172.16.1.128/25. This means we are borrowing the binary digits after the 25th place, if you wrote the IP address out in binary. Let me show you what I mean by writing those ranges out in binary.\n\nFloor A gets this range:\n\n10101100.00010000.00000001.00000000\n\nto\n\n10101100.00010000.00000001.01111111\n\nFloor B gets this range:\n\n10101100.00010000.00000001.10000000\n\nto\n\n10101100.00010000.00000001.11111111\n\nAs you can see, they differ after the 25th digit - floor A gets all the ones that start the last octet with 0, while floor B gets all the ones that starts the last octet with 1. That is the digit that is being used to define the subnet.\n\nSo how does the subnet mask come in to play? It's another way of writing that /25 that works for any address in that range. The way you would write the subnet mask for this example would be 255.255.255.128. So what does this mean? It's a way of calculating out what the network is for a given address that again goes back to binary. What you have to do with this is a calculation on the binary way of writing the IP address based on the positions of each digit. Let me give you an example. Say we go with a host on floor B, 172.16.1.223, and we know its subnet mask is 255.255.255.128. How does your computer know what is local, and what isn't (anything that isn't gets sent to the gateway)? This is what it does in binary. We know that 172.16.1.223 in binary looks like this:\n\n10101100.00010000.00000001.11011111\n\nThe subnet mask looks like this:\n\n11111111.11111111.11111111.10000000\n\nThe calculation that is done is to just take each digit in the IP address of the host and multiply it by the digit in the same position in the mask. It's simple, since anything multiplied by 1 stays the same, and anything multiplied by 0 is zero. Doing that you get:\n\n10101100.00010000.00000001.10000000\n\nThat's how your computer knows what is the first digit in the network 172.16.1.128.\n\nOne last example. Let's go back to your firewall for a second. Let's say you have only 1 IP address going to you. Can you figure out what the subnet must be? Here's a hint - a subnet always has to have at least 4 addresses in it. The reason is, there's always two reserved (as mentioned before), one is for your host (in this case the firewall), and one for its gateway to everything else - in this case, your ISPs upstream gateway. So if you only have one IP address assigned to you, hopefully your subnet mask is 255.255.255.252. Do the binary conversion on that and you'll see that that gives you only 4 addresses, since that last octet is 11111100. That gives you 11111100, 11111101, 11111110, and 11111111 in that range.\n\nI hope this helps!"},

{"title":"ELI5: Why is it that when you have a cold, often only one nostril gets blocked?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"Let me just say a few words about the normal situation and then talk about your cold.\n\nYou have two completely separate noses. A left nasal cavity and a right nasal cavity. They are separated by a wall down the middle called the septum. Each nasal cavity has a number of side rooms called sinuses.\n\nThe air that comes into your nose is filtered by the hairs in your nose, then it is warmed and humidified by the mucosa that lines the basal cavity and the sinuses. Sticking out the side of the nasal cavity are curled up bones called conchae. They are covered by thin mucosa with lots of blood vessels in them and the heat from this blood warms the air. At the back of the nose is a constriction that constricts the flow of air and this causes the air to speed up and in this way you are capable of filling your lungs to the very bottom of your lungs.\n\nNow for the interesting bit. Each side of your nose works for about 90 minutes (from memory) and then it shuts down. The mucosa swells and stops the air flowing through that side of your nose. The mucosa on the other side shrinks and so air flows thro that side. This gives the mucosa s chance to clean and replenish the mucous on the surface. The bulk of the air from your left nasal cavity will go to your left lung, and the air from your right nose goes to your right lung. And this goes left and right every 90 minutes or so. I wonder if this is why we roll over in bed.\n\nSo when you have your cold and BOTH sides get blocked you will only be aware of the side that SHOULD be open. After 90 minutes or so this will swap sides. To get your nose to change sides lie on your side with the blocked side uppermost and with your head slightly back. After a few minutes you will fell it drain and the down side will block up\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: Why do the file sizes of 720p and 1080p files vary so much?","question_detail":"I was recently looking for a movie to download and after a search, there were many versions of the movie to download. Some were 720p quality and, say, 3.8gb for just the movie (no subs added or trailer or extras). But there were other 720p versions for double the file size? Upon further looking I saw 720p versions of the film for 780mb! Also, I saw the same thing with 1080p movies. Some were 3gb for the movie and some were 8gb, for example, without anything extra included, just the movie. \n\nHow can the quality of the movie be rated at 720p or 1080p but with such a large difference in the actual size of the file? As someone who knows very little about this, I would just assume that if the quality is 720p then each of the download files should be pretty close to the same file size? \n","answer":"There is a lot of information that goes into a video file that determines the end space it consumes.\n\nVideo is just a collection of still Frames that are played at a certain rates, Lowest being 24 Frames per second. \n\n**Resolution:**\n\n How many pixels wide and tall is the footage in question. More pixels means more data required to store each frame. so between 720P or 128 by 720 and 1080P or 1920 by 1080 for traditional aspect ratios of 16:9 alone will result in much larger file sizes.\n\n**Color Depth:**\n\n How many bits of information is given to store the color information of a frame in each video. More bits means you can have a potential of a lot more color options and shades within each pixel translating to higher storage requirements.\n\nMonochrome or black and white video takes  a lot less space for instance.\n\n**Frame Rate:**\n\n How many of the videos frames are played within a second. This is means more frames have to be stored in the file increasing in sizes as well.\n\nBit Rate: How much information can be contained within a frame. Higher bit rates means that a video can contain more information IE more color at once moving objects in frame etc.\n\nThis correlates to the compression ratio used by the encoding method.\n\nIf this value is too low for the kind of video you are capturing, it can result in the blocky artifacting that is common on sites like YouTube due to their very high compression and lower bit rates results in lots of moving objects on screen making the image appear much worse than the source material is.\n\nHigher Bit Rates of course translate to a lot more storage but a cleaner looking video, Higher bit rates are not always always better since you can eat up a lot of space with this option alone with little quality benefit in the video.\n\n**Encoder/Container Compression:** \n\nUnfortunately in the age of HD recording, RAW video options are just too large, and while they are objectively the best quality you can get, it is unreasonable to store and stream such files.\n\nthese can get 100s of GBs per minuet of RAW video footage.\n\nSo we use encoders like with Audio to help compress the information and make it much smaller as a result.\n\nHow this works in Video is that encoders will look for what has changed between two frames and only change the parts that were different between them\n\nThe parts that are not moving as a result are compressed and saved as a single portion of the file. The only parts of each frame that are taking up any extra space are the moving bits.\n\nExamples is you standing in front of a Blue wall. If the camera is still the entire time, the Encoder will just save the blue wall in each frame as a single object and display it over and over again within each consecutive frame since it never changes. \n\nBut you moving around gesturing talking will be constantly updated within the video encoder taking up the majority of the space within each frame of the video\n\nThus making the video itself much smaller. However, depending on the encoder and the bit rates chosen can result in a wide variety of end result file sizes. \n\nSome are more Lossy than others as well and try to preserve the data between frames as much as possible.\n\nExamples of popular encoding options are H.264 and H.265 "},

{"title":"ELI5: What happens to the electrons in an open loop? Are they shot out the wire?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"Electrons move through a wire because there's \"holes\" in the atoms themselves that the electrons \"fall\" into.  Copper and other metals can easily move electrons from hole to hole.\n\nSo, if you put a bare wire into an electrical outlet, any open \"holes\" for electrons in the wire likely will get filled, but after that point the cut end of the wire won't start spilling electrons out into space -- they're looking for a hole to fill, and air doesn't have a lot of space for electrons to go into.\n\nThat is, until you get to a whole LOT of volts/amps -- if you're pushing electrons into that wire with the bare end with enough force, it will try to spark and connect to the next place that has a lot of empty holes to fill.   This is what lightning is, and the static electricity spark that jumps from your finger to the fridge door when you shuffle your stocking feet on the floor.\n\nShort answer: if the voltage is high enough, yes, they can shoot out the end of a wire, that's what a spark is.   Most of the time, you're not using anything with enough volts to shoot a spark out an end of an electrified, unconnected wire."},

Although compliance is voluntary, a majority of the world's largest mobile phone manufacturers agreed to make their applicable mobile phones compatible with Europe's common external power supply specifications."},
{"title":"ELI5: Waiting for a table","question_detail":"Why is there always a long wait for tables at restaurants when there are clearly tables available, with few people before you.","answer":"A variety of reasons:\n\n* Your party is smaller than the number of seats at the table. Restaurants train their hostesses to avoid seating 2 people at a 4-top (a table with 4 seats) or 4 people at a 6-top, because larger parties spend more in the same amount of time, and tend to give up on waiting sooner than small parties, so they want to keep those larger tables available for larger parties whenever possible.\n\n* There are reservations that have not arrived yet, and those tables are being held for those parties with reservations. \n\n* Server sections. In most restaurants, each server has their own section of tables that they attend to. The hostess has to try and rotate which section a new table is seated in -- it all boils down to the rhythm of service. Being sat with 3 tables all at once means they'll all want to order drinks around the same time, expect their food to come out around the same time, and leave at around the same time. To avoid running one server ragged for an hour, the seating is staggered, so that each server takes on a new table every few minutes, and isn't running food to several tables at the same time. (Please note that this is an ideal situation, and shit happens that screws up the rotation all the time.

{"title":"ELI5: Magnetoshell Aerocapture","question_detail":"A user in the SpaceX sub mentioned that if SpaceX could get Magnetoshell Aerocapture worked out, it'd be a game changing technology.\n\nI've looked and no results came up in ELI5 so I'm hoping someone can break down what it is and why it could be considered game changing.","answer":"There are two parts to that. First, the aerocapture part.\n\nAerocapture is a fancy term used to describe using the atmosphere to slow down ships. When a ship gets close to a planet, if it wants to orbit, it has to slow down, as the gravity can't hold it at the speed it is going at. Now, this normally costs fuel to do, an aerocapture is a way around this, you aim the ship so that it dips into the atmosphere just a little, the atmosphere slows the ship down and as it leaves the atmosphere, it boosts just a little so that it doesn't fall back into the atmosphere, and now you have a steady orbit. \n\nMain problem with this is that entering the atmosphere causes things to heat up a ton as the ship compresses the air as it enters the atmosphere. If it isn't properly equipped with heat shields, the ship will burn up. This isn't always possible though. \n\nSo, now the magnetoshield part. When entering the atmosphere, the super high temperatures may turn the gas into plasma. Plasma is useful because it has magnetic properties, therefore what we can do is use a powerful electromagnet to take this plasma and form a shield against the heat with it by using the magnet to push and shape the plasma. This basically gets rid of the need for heavy heat shields."},

Why are people holding on to methods done 2-3-400+ years ago? \n\nAnd what makes them so great?\n\nI know this is a broad questions. But I am curious.","answer":"Japan has been continually settled by people on those tiny islands for over three and a half millennia.  also the Japanese have always prized beauty and simplicity in everything that they do.  So that means that the methods used to make stuff have been developed and honed and made as efficient as could be using natural materials for at least a THOUSAND years.  So this means that the Japanese have spent a great deal of time figuring out what is the best thing a thing could be, whether that be making mochi, slicing fish for sushi, developing the best rice, growing and harvesting the best tea.  When you spend a great deal of time making something, you love it more than something that gets bought in a store.  And when you learn to discern quality in workmanship and creation, then you can tell when something was handmade with love and workmanship.  I recently started drinking Puerh tea, which is Chinese tea that was picked and processed, squeezed into a brick, and then aged for a few years or more into something that tastes earthy and robust.  I can't drink standard english tea now, because it tastes insipid after Puerh."},
{"title":"ELI5: If Earth had rings like Saturn, how would that affect sending satellites into orbit?","question_detail":"[deleted]","answer":"Short answer: life would be very difficult trying to orbit satellites in the presence of rings.\n\nRings exist in circular orbits in a very flat plane exactly above the equator (the equatorial plane).  Satellites would need to avoid passing through this plane at the same altitude as the rings or they're likely to hit a ring particle and be vaporised.  While there are gaps in rings and they have a limited extent, the boundaries are not sharply defined; there's just a smaller but non-zero chance of encountering ring material away from the rings.\n\nEvery orbit is going to pass through the equatorial plane twice per orbit, except an exactly equatorial orbit which is on the plane all the time.  The safest orbit for a satellite would be for it to pretend to be a ring particle and have a circular, equatorial orbit and be a part of the rings.  Getting into that orbit in the first place would be tricky but not impossible.  It might require a few risky plane crossings between launch and final orbit but the level of risk would depend on the exact nature of the rings.\n\nOur large, close moon means that we can't have rings like Saturn, or at least not for very long.  The moon doesn't orbit exactly in the equatorial plane so its gravity is going to move the ring particles out of the plane and out of circular orbits so that they start to collide with each other.  Any realistic ring scenario for earth is going to involve changes to the moon."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why apparently in many industries, including IT, people have to switch out of their career after 20 years","answer":"Most computer fields suffer from the fact that the technology changes so rapidly.  As a result, there is a limit to the value of experience.  If you're not constantly updating your skills to match the technology, you get left behind (and are no longer of use).  If you are constantly updating your skills to match the technology, you're really no better off than someone in the mid-20s who learned that technology in school and has a few years of work experience under their belt.\n\nHowever, 40-year-olds generally want to be *paid* more than their 25-year-old counterparts.  So they effectively price themselves out of a job if they haven't advanced to a supervisory role (whether hands-on technical knowledge isn't important but people management skills are) by that point.  Unfortunately, there considerably fewer supervisory roles than there are people who would need to advance into them so it's not uncommon for IT workers to have careers that don't last until retirement.\n\nThere's also a general tendency across all work for companies to under-reward their employees compared to new hires.  We tend to view the 'Pro From Dover' as being more skilled and competent than the people we know.  As a result, companies end up poaching employees from similar companies and paying them more to do jobs their own employees could do perfectly well.  Over time this process creates a situation where a career track that doesn't include multiple job changes starts to look like someone who isn't 'worth' poaching."},

{"title":"ELI5: how are cows and rabbits able to eat grass and turn it into muscle mass, but humans have to eat cows and rabbits to do the same thing?","answer":"Cows and Rabbits are herbivores. They have a digestive system that has enzymes and colonies of gut bacteria that allow them to process the plants that they eat more thoroughly and thus extract the things they need to produce muscle. \n\nHumans are not herbivores. We are omnivores. Our digestive system is designed to eat some plants, but also to eat meat to get our nutrition. "},
{"title":"ELI5: Why cannot objects travel at or past the speed of light?","question_detail":"Also, what would happen if the object attempts to?","answer":"As an object approaches the speed of light time slows down, this is called time dialation. So an object moving 98% the speed of light experiences 10% dimemdialation or their time moving at 90% speed. An object moving 99% the speed of light experiences 90% time dialation so it would be experiencing time at 10% speed. As you get closer and closer to the speed of light time dialation increases to a point where time stands still. So an object moving at the speed of light has an infinite speed in it's reference frame. Think of the speed of light as a kind of event horizon where no time can escape as opposed to no light. \n\nIn fact if you accelerated to the speed of light and survived you could travel anywhere in the universe to any time in the future instantly. Want to travel 1 trillion light years in 1 second from your perspective? Travel at the speed of light. \n\nSo in a way light speed is infinite speed, it's just that time dialation cancels out any speed past 300,000,000 meters per second as at that point we reach an equilibrium where by if you increase your speed any more, your speed will slow down from the rest frame an equal amount to your physical speed increase. This is what the speed of light it.\n\nSo in reality there is no speed limit, as in the reference frame of the object traveling you keep accelerating and you keep decreasing the amount of time it takes you to travel a set distance. In fact you can accelerate to a speed which allows you to cross infinite distance in zero time, that's what light speed it. It's just that from an outside observer any gains you make in speed go 100% to slowing down your time as opposed to increasing your relative velocity.\n\nSo in reality light speed is infinite speed, it's only finite from a stationary observers perspective, but from the travelers perspective there is no limit."},

{"title":"ELI5: What does it mean that a gene can express itself in different ways?","question_detail":"I was reading an article about exercise and apparently one of the benefits is that it changes how genes express themselves.\n\nI understand that genes determine how we look, what diseases we're more likely to get and so on, but how does a gene that already exists change its expression? What is the significance of that?\n\nHow specifically does that apply to exercise?","answer":"The other answer sums it up pretty well but the most important thing to remember is that not all of your genes are turned on.  Apart from a bunch of \"housekeeping\" genes that are pretty much required for cells to exist a lot of genes are kept off except in specific cells or under certain conditions.\n\nHowever its more complex than gene expression acting like a molecular switch, its more like an analogue system, but for ELI5 you dont need to think about that"},

{"title":"ELI5: Campaign contributions vs. economic pressure","question_detail":"It's common for people to feel that corporate political campaign contributions are not good things in many cases, and that they should be severely limited, or even banned.  Many of those same people are also in favor of corporations using financial pressures to change policy (like the companies that are moving business away from NC because of the \"bathroom law\" issue).  \n\nWhat's the difference between the two that makes one okay and one not?  I want it to be more than \"when they're on my side, it's ok\", but I can't find an overarching principle that makes this view workable.  \n\nWhat am I missing?","answer":"For what it's worth,I do think ultimately it comes down to whether people think it's doing good. It's not as partisan as it sounds at first glance. Generally,people would be pretty ok if you didn't serve say a racist,but it's not ok to not what to serve say, Hispanics.\n\nThat said,there are big differences. \n\nPart of what makes people uncomfortable with donations is the fact that it's very easy to hide them from plain sight.\n\nAnother is that ultimately,who you do business with is considered a fundamental right in a market economy. We don't like to interfere with that except in extreme cases (like discrimination due to race). Donating money to a politician isn't that we'll regarded,regardless if it's big or small.our political system was never really designed around the idea of donations\n\nPeople also seem to regard it as less selfish. If you're pulling out of a market,you're doing damage to yourself. Whereas with donations,generally people associate them with a business trying to further their bottom line."},

{"title":"ELI5: Electron transfer chain","question_detail":"Why does the electron transfer chain stop completely if for example there is no oxygen or no cytochrome oxidase, doesnt it produce energy from the transfer prior to these acceptors? Why does it comepletely stop if these acceptors are removed, instead of produce less atp","answer":"It will keep running, but only for a short while. The main purpose of the ETC is to move protons (hydrogen atoms without electron) through a membrane, so that you have a lot of positive charge on one side, and negative charge on the other. The protons repel each other, and are attracted by the positive charge of the other side of the membrane, which makes it possible to generate energy by letting them through the membrane. Imagine this like a hydroelectric dam, where the water runs downhill through a bunch of turbines. \n\nNow if there's no oxygen, the protons flowing through the membrane will have nowhere to go, which prevents more from going through the membrane. This is as if the river at the lower side of the dam can't flow off, and the water level keeps rising until it's equal on both side. The role of the oxygen is to remove the protons, so that there's always a charge difference between the two sides of the membrane."},

Most satellites and probes have orange/brown solar panels as well. Why aren't they blue like here on Earth?","answer":"Deuce232 is correct that there are two types of panels, mono and poly crystalline and those are different dark shades.\n\nThe orange color of the panels around the ISS and some other space applications is [Kapton] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapton), a polymer (polyimide) that is space rated for holding together electronics. We used to use it a lot when I worked for NASA. The solar panels around the space station are covered in sheets of flexible Kapton so they could be folded and unfolded for delivery."},
{"title":"ELI5 why Louisiana has fallen to be the worst state to live in even though they are one of the best resourced states and were established well by colonists.","question_detail":"https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings","answer":"Others have noted that former slave states were at a significant disadvantage after the economic collapse brought on by the Civil War. Often overlooked is the role played by climate. Into the 20th century, the Deep South was considerably affected by diseases we now think of as tropical, including yellow fever and malaria. (Ever wonder why the CDC is in Atlanta? It's descended from an agency with the sole job of fighting malaria.) Besides, for most of American history, we've been much better at heating homes in winter than cooling them in summer, which used to make much of the year fairly oppressive in the South. The wide availability of air conditioning has aided massive economic growth in many Southern cities, continuing to the present day.\n\nBut why Louisiana in particular, despite its oil and sugar? It's been argued that Louisiana's partly separate history of colonial governors, plus a healthy dose of piracy and smuggling, has led to a high tolerance for political corruption. Corruption has a remarkable ability to siphon money and resources away from practical uses and hinder development. Indeed, this is a recurring theme in many parts of the world that have seen limited development despite ample natural resources.\n\nAdmittedly, any ranking like this can be a bit silly. North Dakota is up at #4 largely due to an ongoing economic boom, which makes it a good place to find a job, but doesn't negate the bitter climate. Conversely, Americans continue to rank New Orleans highly as a place to visit and live."},

{"title":"ELI5: In general how do medical drugs that target a specific location in the body? For example certain painkillers designed for targeting specific pain? Would a normal OTC painkiller do the exact same thing?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"A medication with be made differently depending on how it is taken.  For example, if you take a medication by mouth, it will get broken down to some extent.  Compare this to one you are injected (either by shot or an IV).  These drugs do not change by digestion are considered 100% bioavailable.  Once in your bloodstream, the way the drug works determines its action.  \n\nIn terms of targeting a specific location, it depends on the drug.  Take ibuprofen (Advil) for example.  People take ibuprofen when they have a fever.  It works by acting to block an enzyme in your cells called COX enzymes from making prostaglandin.  Now prostaglandins in general have many functions, including acting on a part of your brain that actually produces a fever.  It also plays a role in inflammation and heightening your sensitivity to pain.  \n\nBy taking ibuprofen, you reduce the amount of prostaglandins in your body and can reduce your fever and pain levels.  However, there are other areas of your body that make prostaglandins that also have other functions.  This is why you see side effects.  To target medications to certain areas, there is a lot of research and a lot of progress in the [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_drug_delivery).  \n\nBy doing clinical trials, researchers and scientists can determine how much of a drug is needed to achieve the desired outcomes while minimizing the undesired side effects.  The different medications that can be used for the same thing (like pain control) have different chemical makeup which means the thing it targets is different.  \n\nLook at acetaminophen (Tylenol) in comparison.  The way it actually works is not completely known!  However, in comparison to ibuprofen, acetaminophen actually changes the COX enzyme (reduces it - a chemistry term) in the central nervous system (as opposed to just blocking it from working like in ibuprofen).  Because acetaminophen works predominantly in the central nervous system (your brain and spinal cord), it doesn't do a good job on reducing inflammation.  \n\nFinally, we will compare these to aspirin.  Aspirin works by adding a chemical group to the COX enzyme.  When it is added, it turns the COX enzyme off.  One of the effects of this is making it to where platelets (the things that stick together to clot when you're bleeding) actually stick together less (by blocking thromboxane A2 formation).  This is good for those that have problems with their blood vessels getting narrow.  If a blood vessel that goes to your heart gets clogged, it causes a heart attack.  Most heart attacks are caused by blood clots so when a person goes to the emergency room for what doctors suspect is a heart attack, the person is given aspirin immediately.  However, this means if you get a cut, a person that takes aspirin for heart problems will bleed much longer as their platelets won't clot as easily.  \n\nHere are three examples of controlling pain or fever by three different methods.  By looking at how each drug works and the side effects associated with each, someone can achieve the desired outcome while avoiding some of the negative things associated with the medication.  Next time you hear a drug commercial on tv, pay attention.  They tell you what it is used for but then also tell you a long list of side effects that it may cause.  Doctors and pharmacists can usually just listen to the side effects (without knowing anything about the new drug) and know how it works.  "},

{"title":"ELI5:Why does bottled water taste different than tap water?","question_detail":"Don't tell me it doesn't, there's clearly a distinct taste to bottle water, which is supposedly pure. ","answer":"It is based on a critical parameter measure of water purity, called TDS. TDS stands for total dissolved solids. That is, the total number is salts or ions present in the water sample. \nTDS can vary due to type of ions, and the constituent compound of these ions. \nYou can understand this taste thing in a similar yet different stimuli of senses, the visual stimuli. If you see anhydrous copper sulphate, it appears white. But copper sulphate is blue. The difference is because of water molecules forming a complex compound with ions. \n\nTaste and visual stimuli are similar but vary in functionality. \nComing back to taste, with copper ions are present in water( generally present in tap water) the taste will be slightly earthy. In case of bottled water, these ions are removed by process of filtration, treatments etc. Once these ions are removed, the water loses the flavour as well.\n\nVarious ions provide different tastes to water. Copper, iron and silver/gold are ground metals,this provide earthy tastes, and are good for the body as they help in neural and physical development while metals like lead, or heavy amounts of chromium etc. causes defects in the body, which lead to cancer. \n\nIn the eastern societies like India, elders prefered eating in copper/ silver plates as it provides the necessary ions along with food, which makes absorption easier for the body. They prefer drinking water from copper pots as well. "},

{"title":"ELI5: If expansion of space can occur faster than light, but gravity can attract faster than that, can we move through space faster than light?","answer":"I will try to give a more precise answers than those already given, at the risk of being ELI6.\n\nGravity is the geometrical curvature in spacetime. Changes in the curvature propagate at the speed of light. Hence an object will continue to follow the geodesic, or shortest path, through spacetime, even if changes in curvature are not propagating through it. Hence objects are not gravitationally pulled \"faster than light\" the spacetime curvature is just that large.\n\nThe expansion of space isn't a true velocity.

You are safer to view expansion as an increase in distances between objects and not even an increase in an abstract thing called \"space\"."},

{"title":"ELI5: Inertia Vs. Momentum","answer":"They are related but not the same thing.  \n   \nInertia is the property that items with mass have which is a resistance to *change* in motion.  Things which are not in motion \"resist\" being put into motion; things that are in motion resist any changes to that motion (speeding up, slowing down, changing direction). \n   \nMomentum is a measure of the force of motion a body has.  It is the product of the object's mass and its velocity.  (Note: this is not the same thing as the *energy* of motion, or kinetic energy, which is 1/2 m x v^2 .)  \n   \nHave you ever wondered why objects of different masses fall at the same rate (in a vacuum) even though the more massive items have more gravitational force acting upon them?  It is because of inertia.  More massive items on Earth are being pulled towards the Earth with a greater force ( F = G x m1 x m2 / r^2 ).  But more massive items also have more inertia, so they have a greater resistance to moving due to that force.  It all cancels out, and all objects are accelerated at the same rate (ignoring air resistance) when falling."},

{"title":"ELI5: How does HTTPS work?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"Let's say Sam and Charlie (server and client) want to talk to each other in secret, and each has a special box that let's them type in messages and it prints out the encrypted message. These boxes are a little special though; they're not like the enigma machines where the same box is used to encrypt and decrypt the messages. \n\nSam is the one that made the boxes. Hers is called the Private Key box. She makes another box that's called the Public Key box that's based off of the Private Key box. Anyone can have the Public Key box, and is free to take it apart; it doesn't matter since it doesn't reveal anything. What these two boxes do is a little different though. \n\nCharlie (or anyone else) can take a message, type it into the Public Key box, and it will spit out an encrypted printout. However, he can't decrypt it with his Public Key box; nor can anyone else with the Public Key box. Only Sam's Private Key box can decrypt the message. On the flip side, Sam's Private Key box can generate a message that any Public Key box can decrypt, but only the Private Key box can create a message that the matching Public Key box decrypts into a comprehensible message. \n\nNow this is useful; Charlie can be confident that any message he creates can only be read by Sam. Likewise, any message that he can decrypt with his Public Key box must have come from Sam, even if anyone else can read it. \n\nSo how does Charlie know he's actually talking to Sam in a way that's hard to break? Easy; he takes his Public Key box and makes up a gibberish sentence: \"The stork Comes 4 couth banquet.\" He takes that gibbish message and sends it out to Sam. Sam takes it, decrypts it, then ecrypts it again with his private key (so that any public key can decrypt it) and sends it back to Charlie. Charlie decrypts the response, and sees that the message he got back is, \"The stork Comes 4 couth banquet.\", the same message he sent back out. \n\nNow the sentence itself is meaning gibberish. However because Charlie sent it out and got it back, that tells him two important things: \n\n1) Only Sam with his Private Key box could have successfully decrypted the message he sent. \n\n2) Only Sam could have created the response that Charlie could decrypt with his Public Key box. \n\nThat means that Charlie is fairly confident that he's actually talking to Sam. \n\nHowever they can't keep using these boxes. First off, they're sloooow. Secondly, the more you use your Public and Private key boxes, the more data that someone else listening in on the conversion has to try and figure out what's in the Private Box that makes it tick. Eventually anyone listening in will have enough data to start working on figuring out what's inside of the Private Key box. \n\nHowever Charlie and Sam have got another trick up their sleeves. They have another box called the Advanced Encryption Standard box. This one is a bit different; you plugin a single secret key and it uses that one key to both encrypt and decrypt messages. And this AES box is a LOT faster then the Private / Public boxes. \n\nSo Charlie, now confident that it's Sam and that Sam is actually listening, scribbles down one time use only key and plugs it into his AES box. He then encrypts that AES key using his Public Key Box, and sends the encrypted message to Sam. \n\nSam decrypts it, sees that he's now got an AES key, and plugs that into his AES box. He then sends a single word reply back to Charlie using his Private Key box: \"Ready!\" Charlie then puts away his Public key and starts typing messages into the AES box, and vice versa with Sam.\n\nWhen they're done, they remove the AES keys and more or less shred them. The key's now gone forever ; the next time they do this Charlie will have to create a new AES key and anyone that was listening in will have to decrypt the AES session using analysis and the like instead of just sending someone to Charlie's house and beating the AES key out of him. \n\n\n\nNOTE: This is overly simplified but it is the just of how an SSL session is established between a Client and a Server. The certificates are just used to verify that the server is the right one and then establishes the encrypted tunnel using a one time use symmetric key. "},

{"title":"ELI5 The Jim Crow racial caste system that used to exist in America.","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"Southern states first had to disenfranchise black voters. Paramilitary groups such as the KKK were used during the military administration of the Reconstruction Era for violent voter suppression and terror tactics. After Reconstruction ended direct legal methods were instituted:\n\n* Poll taxes were fees required for restoration, which blacks and poor whites were typically unable to afford\n* Literacy tests were used ostensibly to determine whether a person was intelligent enough to vote, but in reality were another measure intended to exclude blacks and poor whites from voting\n* Grandfather clauses were used in order to allow poor whites to get around these suppression tactics. The origin of the name comes from the provision that \"if you grandfather was eligible to vote, you are eligible to vote\". Conveniently, in the late 19th century the grandfathers of black freedmen were almost entirely slaves who couldn't vote.\n* White primaries were closed primary elections that directly excluded black voters from choosing a candidate for the general, and allowed white supremacist candidates to dominate Democratic Party candidacies in general elections in the southern states, which were easy victories in combination with other disenfranchisement tactics\n\nMany southern states in fact wrote these measures into their *state constitutions*, so they would be extremely difficult to change even if white supremacists lost control of state governments - in order to get rid of them, intervention by the Supreme Court and federal legal measures would be required.\n\nThe disenfranchisement of blacks in the Southern states allowed southern lawmakers to institute a segregated society, where whites and blacks could only use separate facilities - ie schools, public transportation, even bathrooms and water fountains. Black facilities by and large were much more poorly-funded and maintained than their white equivalents. This also extended to private institutions, where businesses could refuse to serve black customers without legal repercussion.\n\nBut Jim Crow was even more insidious than overt legal suppression and segregation. It extended deep into the culture of the nation. Interracial relationships and marriages were banned. Residential ordinances segregated black residents of cities into their own, poorer, neighborhoods, which devolved into ghettos due to a variety of economic and discriminatory reasons. When ordinances failed (such as when a black man became wealthy enough to move out of the ghetto) and/or were struck down, white homeowners would band together to form exclusionary covenants and refuse to sell property in their neighborhoods to African-Americans. Real estate businesses joined in on the bandwagon by using despicable tactics such as blockbusting to make a tidy profit.\n\nJim Crow is the reason racial inequality - economically, politically, and socially - still exists across the US today. The segregation and prejudice runs so deep within our culture and institutions that the gains of the Civil Rights movement only scratched the surface."},

Now, the bank has total deposits of $1900 and is able to lend more money. \n\nThis is not like printing money, and will not affect the purchasing power of the $10 in your wallet. \n\nThe 'created money' at this stage is just an I.O.U. What the bank has in its vault is $1000 cash and a loan contract signed by you.

{"title":"ELI5: How do scientist split an atom?","question_detail":"I'm told it was first done in 1917, but i have no idea what it actually means to \"Split\" an atom. ","answer":"Within the nucleus of an atom, there are two forces of concern- the Strong Nuclear Force, and the Electromagnetic Force. \n\nThe Strong Nuclear Force is always attractive, is stronger than the other fundamental forces, but has a VERY short range, on the order of 1-2 nucleons. This force is what holds atoms together. \n\nThe EM force in this case is repulsive, and only acts between protons. this force is much weaker than the Strong force, but has a much much larger range. \n\nThe overall result is that most atoms are stable, and up to Sulfur (16 protons, 16 neutrons) are stable with a 1-1 ratio. past Sulfur the EM force is such that you need more and more neutrons to hold things together. \nUranium is the last naturally occurring element, and is the limit to stable atoms. (and with 92 protons to 146 neutrons, it has a 1-1.6 P-N ratio)\n\nSplitting (or more properly, fission) occurs when you push one of these heavy atoms into an highly unstable configuration. These atoms usually only need one or two neutrons to force this process. (as an example of the latter, U238 is fissionable but not fissile- it will not fission to slow, or thermal neutrons, but it will to higher energy, or fast, neutrons. It can absorb a thermal neutron, turning into fissile Pu-239.)\nU235 on the other hand, will readily absorb a thermal neutron. The  atom exists very briefly as an excited U-236 nucleus. As this configuration is VERY unstable, it will drop to a more stable state by splitting into two smaller atoms, with masses averaging about 95 and 135, and several neutrons. "},

The difference between the hybrids being the combination of parent animals. Does this also occur in breeding of domesticated animals?","answer":"Hybrids happen most easily when the two parents have the same number of chromosomes (in addition to being relatively closely-related species). However, the same genes are not necessarily mapped to the same chromosomes, or the same spots on chromosomes, between two different species. \n\nWhen the chromosomes split in sex cells, then fuse again during conception, you get genes in unusual locations, which can end up being dependent on the sex of the parent, like u/kittymandrake3 explains. The same phenomenon happens with horse/donkey hybrids: a mule and a hinny look pretty different, but a mule has a donkey for a father and a mare for a mother, where a hinny is the opposite. "},
{"title":"ELI5: How do baby turtles know which direction is the ocean and how do they know they should be heading that way?","question_detail":"[deleted]","answer":"Hatching is generally done at night and they head toward the brightest light source, which is ideally going to be the reflection of the moon off the water.  I live in Florida and A1A, the road on the Atlantic coast where most turtles nest, goes through really populated places with lots of businesses so there are people that go to the dunes during hatching season to help guide the newly hatched turtles to the ocean since things like light pollution from street lights and signs can sometimes be brighter than the moon."},

{"title":"ELI5: What are functions made of?","question_detail":"ELI5: What are functions made of? \n\nFor example, in Java, the print function is a library function, but how would you make it without a library? \n\nIs there a list of things Java can do, innately, from which all other functions are built? ","answer":"Generally speaking, almost all high level programming languages are defined primarily in terms of the language constructs themselves (how do loops and flow control work, concurrency and memory access models, etc.); basic math is usually also in there. If you're lucky there is also a 'standard library' of functions that are provided to perform the most common tasks and basically talk to the rest of the world, but depending on the language it may not be the case. And then you almost always have additional layers of libraries for more complex things, especially to interface to specific operating systems and support a modern UI.\n\nLibraries don't even need to be implemented using the same language, the compiler (translates the programming language into low level instructions) and linker (puts the individual pieces together) just need to know how to arrange the function call and parameters. For example, math functions are often built into the CPU directly, but on some architectures there is no hardware support for floating point operations and libraries need to supply appropriate code to perform them. Nowadays this happens both during the build ('static linking') as well as during runtime ('dynamic linking'), which has the benefit that you can update such libraries (as long as the interface doesn't change) without having to rebuild the applications that use them."},

{"title":"ELI5: How do cemeteries work?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"There are various types of 'plots':\n- Regular, where you pay for a specific period. After this period (where I've worked it was 10 years), and no renewal has been paid, the remains are dug up and either scattered, recycled, or destroyed. Based on the ground, a plot can be 1, 2, or 3 layers deep (at least 6 ft. below the surface, and another 3 ft. per layer. When one layer is removed, sometimes layers above it are reburied.\n- Communal, the same as the above, but without the reburial. After a couple of years the remains are removed.\n- Family, where you pay for an unlimited period, with the option of additional burials. *If it fits, it sits.*\n- Group, more or less the same as a Family grave, but for a specific group of remains, for instance for nuns of a particular order.\n- Generic, like communal, but just numbered, no plaques, etc.\n\nWhen a cemetery is full, sometimes graves are \"removed\", or administratively cleaned to add more space. This happens when a plot is full, and no upkeep has been paid, and nobody can be found who wants to pay for it. Everything is then recycled, and the plot is reassigned for new burials."},

But some people can't stand the laugh tracks, and many comedy shows do without them."},
{"title":"ELI5: How is it that you need to install PC Games but the same game can be played immediately on console after inserting the Disk?","answer":"PCs and current generation consoles - PlayStation 4 and Xbox One specifically - are practically the same types of devices these days. And, in fact, PS4 and XB1 games still require some installation to run properly, for similar reasons that PC versions need to install.\n\nOlder-gen consoles, even up to PS3 and Xbox360, had different architectures designed for running games off the disc or cartridge. Cartridge games tend to contain all the hardware necessary to run a game inside the cartridge, and different cartridges may contain different hardware specs, while the console provides controller inputs, audio-visual outputs, and the CPU.\n\n---\n\nPart of the problem with any video game is dealing with **RAM**. Reading data from a CD, DVD, or BluRay is a few magnitudes slower than reading that same data from a standard hard drive, and even that is many magnitudes slower than reading data from the RAM. The goal of the game's programmer is to use the limited RAM to store as much of the necessary data as possible for quick access, while unloading unneeded resources and loading new ones as efficiently as possible.\n\nUp until and including the PS3/Xbox360 error, the most amount of RAM they were dealing with was 256MB. The PS3's BluRay drive can read data at roughly 9MB/s, give or take: even without loading the game to the hard drive (which in some cases, it did anyway), it's possible for it to fill the RAM completely in about 30 seconds. Sounds like a slow loading screen for sure, but some games might only need to fill about a quarter of the RAM to start a level, then continue loading assets in the background as the game ran. That comes to about 7 seconds on the loading screen, just reading from disc.\n\nCompare that to PS4 and XB1, which both have 8GB of RAM, *32 times* the amount of RAM space as the previous generations. Meanwhile, for comparison, the PS4's BluRay drive reads at about 27MB/s, only about 3 times the speed as the previous gen. For that disc drive to fill even a fraction of the available RAM - and more of it, due to the increased size of assets in a PS4 game compared to PS3 - would take a few minutes, at least. That's a *long* loading screen.\n\nMeanwhile, a standard hard drive using SATA connections can transfer data at about 300MB/s, about 11 times faster than the PS4's BluRay drive. Just imagine a PS4 game with a loading screen that takes 10 seconds to start the level; then imagine it's reading from disc only, and that it now takes almost *2 minutes* to load.\n\nAnd **that** is why games are installed to hard drive: it can load data to the RAM *way* faster than an optical disc ever could.\n\n---\n\nAs for PCs, game developers making games for the PC don't usually have the same hardware restrictions as they do for consoles. So, up to a couple console generations back, they weren't required to make the game work only from the disc, and they didn't have to shove all their assets into a very tiny amount of RAM.\n\nSome older PC games did work from the disc alone, though they might still need to install certain dependencies onto the PC first - graphics libraries, an engine, hardware drivers, etc. These were pre-installed on consoles, of course, but they couldn't be certain that all PCs in the wild had the right specs for their game. So, installation of some kind was almost always necessary to ensure the game could work right."},

","answer":"I think it was the book *Freakonomics* where I read there is a correlation between the introduction of television and a surge in crime. And because TV stations didn't show up everywhere at once in the US, they were able to go back and look at individual regions and see the same pattern as TV spread across the country.

{"title":"ELI5: Do gases like helium always change your voice by a certain amount of octaves, if not, why?","question_detail":"So I'm wondering, I just discovered Sulfur Hexafluoride and that because it is 6 times heavier than air, makes your voice sound deeper.\n\nSo I'm wondering if gases like Helium and Sulfur Hexafluoride always make your voice go up/down a certain amount of octaves (for example 3 octaves no matter how high pitched the person originally is), or is there a max that someone's voice will stop at?\n\nFor example, would a person with an already deep voice still sound like they had a significantly deeper voice than a person with a higher pitched voice if they both inhaled Sulfur Hexafluoride?\n\nOr is there a \"max deep\" a person's voice can be at under the influence of gases? (I know you can have things so low/high pitched that the human ear cannot hear it, but wondering if it will stop at a still audible level at some point if under the influence of those gases)\n\nIs it the same with helium?","answer":"How much a gas will change the timbre of a person's voice depends on that person's vocal folds:\n\nThe folds will always produce the same vibrations (as this is an inherent quality of a person's folds) to create sound but because the different gases have different speeds of sound and this causes the resonant frequencies of the person's vocal tract to change (in case of helium the frequencies become higher because the speed of sound is higher, in case of sulfur hexafluoride lower). \n\nAs the change of the speed of sound is always the same with the same gases (assuming same temperature and pressure) which means the ratio of change is always the same those frequencies change by the same percentage which means that a lower voice will be less affected than a higher voice."},

If I say something wrong about X, and then realize I was wrong, I might follow it with \"I lied, it's actually Y\".

{"title":"ELI5: How does autism develop after adolescence and into adulthood?","question_detail":"Is the individual able to cope better with the situation due to a more developed brain? Does it become less noticeable if it was severe as a child? Does it keep progressing or is there a point at which an individual stops on the spectrum?","answer":"Autism Spectrum Disorder describes a very wide range of behaviors and levels of functioning. While some adults with ASD are able to attend college and pursue their careers, others have severe cognitive impairments and need help with basic life skills. There are some nonverbal children who grow up to be adults with excellent language skills. So it really depends on the individual - each person with autism has a unique timeline of development. Preschool, speech/language therapy (for communication skills) and occupational therapy (for daily living skills) make a huge difference, especially before Kindergarten. Around this age it's hard to tell how far the child's skills will go.\n\nIn my experience teaching young adults/teens with autism, I notice that my students between 13-18 show a lot of the same emotional changes that typical teens face. Things like mood swings, tantrums, and increases in self-injury are pretty common. Autistic teens who spend most of their time in regular classes have to navigate a extremely complex social world - it's like everyone else has the manual to social interaction except for you. I bet if you ask a lot of parents of autistic kids, most of them would say teenage years are rough. These were definitely my brother's worst years (he has severe autism). Of course this isn't the same for everyone.\n\nBy 18-25, the storm of puberty fades and many autistic people become more mature, just as non-autistic people do. At this point a lot of professionals see this point as the beginning of a plateau (e.g. \"a 25 year old nonverbal adult will never learn to speak\"), but in my experience this is a great time to introduce new skills. This is the time when my students tend to show more social interest, are more willing to try new experiences, and are able to focus with more patience. There are some adults who don't change much after this age - it depends on the supports they get and the level of their impairment.\nRealistically by this age, an adult with severe autism will always have severe autism, but he/she can still continue to learn new ways to communicate or learn to do new things independently. \n\ntl;dr It depends on the person and how much help they get.

{"title":"ELI5: Why do people with unusually high IQs tend to be lacking in social skills? Is it a product of their environment or is it an issue with their brain?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"I can't find any research that makes any connection between IQ and social skills. Just because there are a lot of websites and blogs that talk about IQ and social skills doesn't mean that it is accurate or that a connection exists. If you could share why you think there is a connection I'd like to take a look at what you have. Specific individuals have to be explained as specific cases without making generalized rules.\n\nScientifically speaking, there is no agreed-upon way to measure social skills nor are their agreed definitions to what social skills are important. Researchers also disagree upon the use of IQ to measure intelligence (here is a link to [multiple intelligences](http://www.tecweb.org/styles/gardner.html) which is replacing the idea of IQ scores). A quick look through any psychology, philosophy, sociology, or teaching journals will reveal this.\n\nIt sometimes appears that intelligent people are more likely to be socially awkward because some individuals are 'redeemed' from their quirks because of their intelligence - so we are more likely to be aware of their high IQ when we interact with them. We are more likely to notice and remember awkward people (and those that are intelligent) than we are to remember normal people. With smart and socially stable individuals we are less likely to notice or care that they are smart, so they are less likely to be noticed (or are simply seen as normal).\n\nAs an example, consider all the friends you think of as socially normal - how often do you think about their IQs? Now think of all the people you know who are socially awkward - how often do you think about their intelligence?\n\nI and my wife teach for a living. From  personal experience I can say that the way a child spends their time is extremely important in determining their behaviors as adults. Children that spend more time reading books or engaged in solitary hobbies are spending less time developing social skills. If the critical window is missed (ages 5 to 12), this leads to many social ticks that have to be consciously controlled for later in life - such as an inability to quickly recognize emotions in others, or an inability to read body language.\n"},
{"title":"ELI5: why do some pc games need to be installed and some don't?","answer":"i have to disagree with other commenters on here.\nonce i tried to transfer a game folder from one pc to another and the game didn't work. the reason for this might have been that the other computer didn't have the dependencies installed (ie. directx, .net framework etc.) or that they, at least weren't updated to the last version. most game installers ask you to install these programs or do it automatically. the second reason might have been the fact that some games create seperate folders, most of the time in your documents directory. the third option might be something else. i don't know. in any case after i ran the installer on the second pc, it worked, therefore, there's more to it than merely convenience and drm.

But mercury and other toxins do get into the muscle of the fish which we eat and eating too much fish can lead to mercury toxicity.  Now that being said, fish has some real health benefits (good lean source of protein high in omega-3s).

{"title":"ELI5: Why are some government officials elected and others appointed?","answer":"There are two main reasons. The first is that elected positions are generally seen as being more responsive to political pressure so we make offices that should be responsive to political pressure elected (political pressure in this case mostly means pleasing voters). \nFor example, the President is supposed to push and agenda that represents what the majority of voters in the country want, so it's an elected position. Similarly, legislators are supposed to make laws that reflect the desires of the majority of their electorates. \n\nJudges, however, are not supposed to do what a majority of voters want. Instead, judges are supposed to make correct legal decisions, which sometimes may be unpopular. For example, you don't want to make a judge to sentence someone to death who wasn't proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt just because the judge is afraid they might lose the upcoming election otherwise. As a result, most jurisdictions have appointed judges. \n\nThe second reason is that some appointed officials work under an elected official and that elected official has to be able to control them in order to carry out their desires. For example, the secretary of state is appointed because they're supposed to carry out the president's foreign policy. If we elected a separate secretary of state we could end up with a president and secretary who want a vastly different foreign policy and no way to resolve the stalemate. So while there are a lot of powerful appointed officials, most of them are in the executive branch and supposed to help the elected President put their agenda into action."},

{"title":"ELI5 the basics of Prussia and its difference from what would be the rest of Germany","question_detail":"What was the rest of Germany doing at the time? Who were they? How come they weren't part of the country?","answer":"Prussia first started to exist in 1525 as an ethnically mostly German duchy under the Polish King.\n\n\"Germany\" didn't exist, there existed a metric shit-ton of kingdoms, duchies, counties, bishopries and all kinds of weird stuff. There was the Holy Roman Empire which was more like a mutual defense cooperation. The Empire was far from a country.\n\nThe Prussia you probably think about is the Kingdom of Prussia, which is what the Duchy of Prussia became in 1701. They slowly expanded by annexing smaller German States (which were independant countries).\n\nPrussia became a real Big Player after Napoleon. French Emperor Napoleon defeated basically all of Europe, including Germany. He dismantled the Holy Roman Empire and cleared up the chaos of German States and lowered their number to around 30. Prussia, as one of the winners later against Napoleon gained huuuuge new territories, especially the Rhineland which just started its first attempts at industrialising, already had a large population, and thus was quite valuable.\n\nThis is the time most people first hear about Prussia, because now Prussia became interesting for Europe and the world. Prussia continued to wage war against its smaller German neighbours, and when it became strong enough it forced most other small German States into the North-German Confederation. At this point only four other German States remained. The Kingdom of Bavaria, the Grand-Duchy of Baden, the Kingdom of Würtemberg, and the Austrian Empire. Prussia didn't want Austria in. And after Prussia successfully provoked France into war, it called the other States (without Austria) to help them. After the victory against France, the Southern German States agreed to be incorporated into the German Empire.\n\nSo for the question about the rest of Germany: They were independant countries. The Kingdom of Saxony was a sovereign independant State until it joined the North-German Confederation in 1866.\n\nThe Kingdom of Hannover was an independant sovereign State until it was forcefully annexed (conquered) by Prussia in 1866. \n\nThe Kingdom of Bavaria was an independant sovereign State until it joined the German Empire in 1871.\n\n"},

{"title":"[ELI5] How does the U.S economic system work if it isn't backed by any kind of valuable?","answer":"The U.S. dollar is a fiat currency. This means that the U.S. government has promised that it will accept the U.S. dollar as legal currency, and guarantees the value of \"$1\". The piece of paper itself is worthless, but as long as people have faith that the government can and will support the dollar it will be successful. That's why the dollar has printed on it that it: \"This note is legal tender for all debts public and private.\" The U.S. government guarantees its value.\n\nA commodity currency like gold is very similar to a fiat currency. Gold does not have an inherent value. It has whatever value people give it, the same way that the US dollar has whatever value people give it.\n\nAll economics are based on how much people want the thing you have, and how much you want the thing they are willing to trade you for it.

At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution the key inventions for the ones that unlocked coal a form of chemical energy that was way more than the human energy that had been unlocked by the Agricultural Revolution or the water energy that have been powering would pass for industry up to that time. This increased energy availability allowed for advances that even if people had figured them out 100 or 200 or 500 years before simply wouldn't have been feasible to do or build. Accompanied by advances in science changes in labor changes in society things like increase literacy but you ended up with was a perfect storm for Rapid advancement something that was made even faster we managed to stumble upon Electronics opening up an entirely New Field to do inventions in."},

{"title":"ELI5:How does the ATM fee reimbursement process work","question_detail":"The obvious explanation is the bank just eats the money and reimburses you, but at what point does this happen and what are all the things that happen in this process?","answer":"My bank has ATM reimbursement, which means that every time my card is used at another bank, an alert goes out to my bank. They then contact the bank (they also have a fee schedule on file) to figure out how much the fee is, and deposit that amount into my bank account. \n\nThis only happens if there is a fee to be reimbursed, and only at an ATM. It's a customer service feature that is supposed to draw customers. It makes us seem valuable, and the deposit is done automatically, so I don't have to pester anyone for it. "},
{"title":"ELI5: When are music genres considered 'folk'","question_detail":"When are modern contemporary genres considered folk? Would say, dixieland jazz, delta blues or ska be considered folk?","answer":"I could be wrong, but here's my take. You can write and sing traditional folk songs which have been passed down through generations (for example, The House of the Rising Sun) and I suppose this is the folk in its strictest sense. Often just an acoustic guitar, maybe a harmonica, you know? Or you can write music innthe folk tradition, imitating that style. Early Bob Dylan would be an example. Or if you're a singer-songwriter who mainly sticks to the acoustic guitar, your work can be described as folk because it sticks to that stripped-down idea. Think 1970s Dylan or early Ed Sheeran. Then slow rock which has a similar to this last type of folk but may habe more instruments, or be a band instead of a solo artist, particularly if it's a ballad, that stuff can also loosely be labelled folk or folk rock too. Like, err, Neil Diamond songs I guess. Or something..\n\nThis is complicated by the term \"folk ballad\", which in literary terms refers to a very specific metrical structure (alternating four and three feet or five and four feet to a line) for a poem. Or it can just mean a ballad in the folk tradition."},

Is that what makes ibprophin an NSAID? While we're at it what makes a medication an NSAID? ","answer":"The reason Tylenol isn't an NSAID is because it doesn't control inflammation. It is a weak non-narcotic pain medication. NSAIDs are Non-Steroidal AntiInflammatory Drugs.  Drugs thay aren't steroids that reduce inflamation.\n\nLets say you twist your ankle and its all swollen and painful. You take a Tylenol and its not as painful, but its still just as swollen. You take an nsaid like advil instead and its less painful AND it is less swollen. That's because its actually reducing the inflammation response your body naturally activates during certain injuries or illness.\n\nAs far as pregnacy, they both have potential to cause issues with the fetus, but Tylenol has been studied and deemed the safer alternative with less risks involved.\n\nAs far as blood thinning, asprin is a blood thinner and ibuprofen does have some weak blood thinning properties (not as strong as asprin), but that is not what makes it an NSAID.\n"},

That said, it's not likely that someone is performing this type of snooping on you.\n\nIf you use any company's service where they're a middle-man in storage and transmission of data, the company can see *every* interaction. Some also use your \"i'm signed in\" status to track your sign-in cookie across all the places you visit that are part of their social media or advertising networks. The amount of data they log about those interactions varies greatly. Most companies like to stay out of legal trouble. There's going to be limits on what they keep and there's going to be some process for actually gaining both anonymised and un-anonymised access to the data.

{"title":"ELI5: Was the catalyst for the YouTube revenue/clean content issue caused by the Wall Street Journal articles on YouTube?

It has a reputation of having extremely rigorous and analytical reporting and investigations so if they're printing something in the news section, they're sure of it. And when it's a hot-button issue like the controversial content on Youtube, readers have a lot of faith that WSJ is telling it straight and has looked at all sides of the situation.\n\nIt's actually really hard to overstate WSJ's reach. I'm in an MBA program right now and virtually every class has WSJ listed as an optional/recommended reading material, and some professors explicitly send us some of their old articles to read. Every graduate from my business school is conditioned to follow and trust WSJ's reporting and we're probably not the only school like that."},

But no one says in in a way i understand, one redditor did make a comment about this but he/she started talking about fingers and drawing on fingers and i just got even more confused.\n\n\nAlso, why are there not 2 or 4 bit stuff? why does it start with 8 bit? (If its me being dumb and just never hearing of 2 or 4 bit stuff just tell me) \n\n\nWhy is the most popular bit stuff in 32 or 64 bit?\n\n\nWhy is the highest bit i've heard of 64 bit? Wouldn't the more bits it has the better? Is this a hardware limitation? ","answer":"Gonna try to keep it really ELI5:\n\n&gt; Why is computer memory always multiples of 2.\n\nTake a basic digital watch (the ones where the numbers are composed of little sticks). By tweaking it, you can make the watch display any number from 00:00 to 99:99 (so 0 to 9999, which is 10000 numbers). If you want to make it display the next number in the list, you have to add a row of little sticks to display one more number on the screen 10:00:0. Same thing after 99:99:9, etc... THIS MEANS THAT DISPLAY CAPACITY WILL ALWAYS COME IN MULTIPLES OF TEN: the one that can display 10 numbers (0-9), 100 numbers (0-99) etc..\n\nIt's the same for memory, except that the little display slots can only hold two numbers in each (0-1) instead of ten (0-9). Therefore, they will always come in multiples of two.\n\n&gt; Also, why are there not 2 or 4 bit stuff? why does it start with 8 bit? (If its me being dumb and just never hearing of 2 or 4 bit stuff just tell me) \n\nThere are two things we are talking about here: a BIT and a BYTE.\nA BIT is a switch that can have two states: ON or OFF. You can have as many of those as you want. A BYTE is a group of 8 BITS, and is the base unit used for memory. The reason for that is that a BIT is too small to hold any useful information (only two states, ON or OFF) in an efficient way, so we group them 8 by 8 to give them more uses (8 bits together can have 256 different states in total, which can be used to store numbers, letters, and a bunch of symbols). \n\n&gt; Why is the most popular bit stuff in 32 or 64 bit.\n\nIn essence, the 32 and 64 bits are the size of the base files in the machine. Every time you want to go to the next size, you have to double the power and capacity of EVERYTHING in your machine. 32 and 64 are both a manageable size that can be used by commercial computers, 32 works for everything under around 4GB of memory and 64 for everything above.\n\n&gt; Why is the highest bit i've heard of 64 bit? Wouldn't the more bits it has the better? Is this a hardware limitation? \n\nYup, hardware limitation. You could have a 128 or 256 bit OS if you wanted to, but no computer would be able to run it efficiently because the processing components would not be able to treat the information fast enough to make it useful.

{"title":"ELI5: why highway signs use fractions instead of decimals","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"The larger the sign, the more it costs to make.\n\nThe symbol \"¼\" fits in one character width (though it is usually enlarged).

{"title":"ELI5:Why does California have so many dumb laws?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"This won't pass since it is a direct challenge to to the tenets of freedom of speech as outlined in many court case precedents (specifically Cohan v. California).\n\nThat being said, California is the most populated and largest economy in the US and has one of the most beautiful environments that has been protected from destruction by oil, coal, and other industries.  All those things require greater protection than say North Carolina where they remove mountain tops and shit on their citizens while blaming minorities for problems created by their politicians. I for one love CA laws.  I'm sure there are some dumb ones out there (I haven't ever encountered any though) but I know enough selfish people who would sell their children's futures for a quick buck so I'm happy with CA's strict laws and regulations.

{"title":"ELI5: how do tube lights work?","question_detail":"How do they actually start up? I've heard there are hot and cold tube lights. How do both work. Also, what is the mercury for. Thanks.","answer":"Fluorescence: You have a gas. Passing electricity through it gives the gas lots of additional energy, and the gas doesn't like it. It gives off the energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation.\n\nTube lights are formally known as fluorescent lamps. The electric current excites the mercury vapor in the tube, producing short-wave UV light that then causes a phosphor coating on the inside of the tube to glow.\n\nBasically this - inside of tube lined with phosphor coating and tube filled with mercury vapour. Electric current through vapour. Mercury shakes off this energy in the form of UV radiation. But UV is useless for household lighting, so phosphor coating on the inside converts that UV into visible light.\n\nHot vs cold tube lights is a bit beyond ELI5 level, but here goes:\n\nThermionic emission is basically pushing electrons (or some other charge carrier) through a conductor by using heat. Most fluorescent lamps use thermionic emission to emit electrons into the tube (that is usually the easiest way to do it, because you can't simply generate an electric current from one end of the tube to the other.)\n\nThese are known as hot tube lights.\n\nHowever, heat isn't the only way to push the electrons across. Just like in lightning storms, an electric current can exist between the two ends of the tube if there's a sufficiently large potential difference. This doesn't mean that there is no heat generated, but just that it isn't high enough for thermionic emission to occur. In other words, \"cold\" tube lights. (Cold, as you would have guessed, is only relative to \"hot\" tube lights.)"},

{"title":"ELI5: LCD Controller boards. Why are they needed? Why are there so many types? Aren't all LCDs basically the same?","answer":"Are they all the same? Quite the opposite, actually. Each LCD controller board is built specifically to the LCD it came with, and that board will not work on any other LCD. I don't know the specifics behind them, but basically each LCD is slightly different due to a variety of different things, and as a result, they need a controller built specifically for them. Thankfully most controllers have a standard communication protocol called LVDS that makes working with the controllers easier. Due to LVDS, you can have any number of devices and boards convert the video signal (coax, VGA, HDMI, DVI, DisplayPort, etc) into an LVDS signal for the controller to display."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why is German ancestry the most common in the US even if the nation had English founders?","answer":"I think you might find the history fascinating. Anglo Saxon is derived from areas of Germany and this became a major basis for the people of England.

They founded several of the kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon England, and their name is the root of the name England. The name comes from the district of Angeln, an area located on the Baltic shore of what is now Schleswig-Holstein. Saxony is another part of Germany."},
{"title":"ELI5: Why do items seem to stay more intact when dropped into water in comparison to if they were dropped on concrete?","answer":"You probably know that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, but can only be converted into other forms.\n\nWhen an object is stationary at a height, it possesses potential energy. Releasing it into free fall means that this potential energy gets converted into kinetic energy until the object stops falling.\n\nIn the instant before the object comes to a complete stop, it has a kinetic energy of 0/5*m*v^2 (where m is the mass and v is the velocity at which the object was moving.)\n\nThis energy can't remain in the object as potential energy (which gets reduced the closer the object is to the core of the Earth) and hence results in one of the two outcomes:\n\n1. If the surface on which the object falls is soft and capable of absorbing the energy from the falling object (such as some liquid or a, well... not-hard surface) then the object quickly transfers as much energy as required to avoid too much deformation. Hence it undergoes minimal damage.\n\n2. If the surface is rigid and inflexible, it refuses to deform, meaning that the energy within the object can't enter the surface quickly enough. It gets redistributed within the object, and if the object itself is rigid and inflexible, it undergoes some extent of physical damage.\n\nNote - if you drop an object like a mobile phone from a small height - maybe an inch or two - onto a concrete floor, it isn't likely to break. This is because the potential energy was fairly small to begin with. Similarly, if you were to jump off a helicopter at 1000 ft into the open sea, your kinetic energy will simply be too high to be transferred into the water, and the fall, even though into water, will feel like it's into concrete and almost certainly kill you."},

{"title":"ELI5: How do archaeologists decipher ancient languages and what they mean when they make a discovery?","answer":"Archaeologists generally deal with the uncovering and documenting of material evidence. The academic deciphering or something like linguistic artifacts is more in the purview of historians or linguists. \n\nIn terms of how, in cases like Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, there wasn't anything that could be done until we got our hands on the Rosetta Stone. Basically, we have two options depending on how ancient the language is and whether there are surviving textual examples. \n\nIf we have examples of a written language, those examples are compared to languages that are linguistic descendants of that ancient language. We can see residual words, phrases, sounds, and grammar from those descendants that can be compared to the parent language. We can then piece together different translatable portions so that we can use context to determine other portions. \n\nIt's certainly a very laborious task, and it's near impossible to make a full reconstruction without something like the Rosetta Stone in which a language that is still in modern use (sort of) is directly translating the unknown language.\n\nThe more challenging alternative is reconstructing an ancient language with no existing language data. In this case, the only thing that can be done is reconstruct a theoretical proto-language since there is nothing existing that can prove anything. It involves the painstaking analysis of data on the words, sounds, and grammar of languages born from that hypothetical language.\n\nIt becomes a game of \"what words seem to look similar in most of these languages? how can we reconstruct a proto-form from the similarities in those similar words. Proto-language construction is seriously a headache, and requires a lifetime dedication to something that can't be proven and may never truly be complete, or even appreciated in whatever capacity it's finished. \n\nRe-construction translation is also quite challenging, but fruitful and enriches our understanding of history in a big way. It's very similar to cryptology, since it's about decoding a system of coding (turning ideas/words in your head into words out loud/on paper) through puzzle-solving and looking at related codes to draw out similarities (which is why Navajo was such an uncrackable code during WWII; They couldn't draw on past codes' characteristics since it was built on nothing we were used to in codes or in language grammar."},
{"title":"ELI5: Computers write/read in 1 and 0... Which language does the brain writes/reads memories?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"Computers actually read/write \"on/off\" states. The 1's and 0's are just a representation of the \"ons\" and \"offs.\" Physically, these can be bumps and valleys in a CD-ROM, or voltage spikes in a hard drive (where the spikes are 1's and the absence of spikes are 0's).\n\nApparently neurons, the cells that make up the brain, also have \"either-or\" states of firing or not firing. So brain signals could be considered binary. But brains don't work quite that literally as reading and writing to neurons, so I don't know if you'll find a biologist to agree with that statement.

{"title":"ELI5: Why do pickled foods still need to be refrigerated after opening?","answer":"It depends what kind of pickling method you're talking about.  \n\nIn general, pickling preserves food by making the food inhospitable to harmful bacteria and microorganisms.  \n\nTrue fermentation pickling is the type of pickling used by humans for hundreds of years and can preserve food for long periods of time without refrigeration.  It does this by allowing yeasts to ferment the mixture, which leads to a slightly alcoholic and acidic mixture that inhibits bacteria growth that would spoil the food.  \n\nMost modern store-bought pickles aren't fermented (though they contain vinegar, which is the result of fermentation).  Often, the final brine mixture makes compromises to improve flavor at the expense of preservation.  However, many of these non-fermented brines are still acidic enough to preserve food for lengthy periods without refrigeration, though the flavor and texture of the food might suffer and you might get some incidental bacteria growth on the surface of the brine that doesn't look very appetizing.\n\nThere are also a large variety of *lightly* brined \"fresh\" pickles that contain a brine that isn't suitable for long shelf lives, making refrigeration necessary.  These are often the \"crunchier\" pickles, but it varies.\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: What actually happens when you press down the gas pedal on a car?","answer":"Depends on precisely what you're driving.\n\nIf it's old, the pedal is physically connected by a linkage to the throttle plate. Pushing the pedal opens the throttle, and ends up drawing more air and fuel into the system either through carburation (in **really** old cars), or through a port fuel injection (in 90's cars).\n\nIf it's from this millennium, but not within the last few years, it's the same as the above (although almost no carbureted engines existed from this time period), but now the physical linkage is replaced with an electronic one, where the gas pedal sends a signal to the ECU, and the ECU then sends a signal to the throttle plate and fuel injection system.\n\nIf it's gasoline direct injected (GDI), its the same as the above, but the fuel injection system is internal to the engine cylinders and the fuel injection system behaves more similarly to a diesel engine.\n\nIn a modern common-rail diesel engine, it's essentially the same as a GDI, but there's no throttle plate."},

{"title":"ELI5 why some people get addicted to cigarettes while others don't?","answer":"Most of it is mental.  I've got a highly addictive personality, but not for everything.  Mainly just alcohol and cigarettes.  I've tried plenty of highly addictive drugs, but had no problem putting them down and I don't crave them.\n\nI know my cigarette addiction is mostly mental, not physical (nicotine) because I've tried other nicotine solutions (e-cigarettes, nicotine gum) and they don't work because they don't deliver the same experience.\n\nIt's the same reason that some people can have an occasional drink but some people become full-blown alcoholics, or why some people can party on cocaine every now and then and others become full-blown addicts.  It's a combo of a mental and physical addiction, and some people are just genetically more prone to become addicted to specific vices.\n\nA friend of mine (as he was smoking a joint), asked me \"why do you do that to yourself\" as I was drinking a beer mid-day.  I said \"same reason you do *that* to yourself, I assume.\"  I rarely ever smoke weed, but the friend I'm describing can barely function without it.  He smokes several times per day, and it's rare for him to have a waking moment when he's *not* high."},

Calories are the odd-one out.  Calories are a measure of energy.  If you look on the back of a  cereal box and it says 50 calories, it actually means 50 *kilocalories*.  1 kilocalorie= 1000 calories and 1 calorie is the amount of energy required to raise one gram of water by 1 degree celcius.\n\nSo, **calories tell you how much energy is in a food.  most humans must consume about 2,000 calories a day to sustain bodily functions and movement**.  if you dont, your body will begin to consume itself, but thats another topic i can elaborate on if youre interested.\n\nNow let us discuss the other 3 things.

Let me explain and any smart people please correct me if im wrong.\n\n**Sugar is a source of SHORT-TERM energy**.  consume a lot of sugar and within 15 minutes you're gonna be off the walls for an hour or so then you're gonna lose all energy.  in general, avoid sugar.  it's an unreliable source of energy.  it's better to gain energy through carbs/protein.\n\n**Carbs are MID-TERM energy**.  Carbs, found in foods like rice and pasta and bread, is easily absorbed but not as easily as sugar.  it takes a bit longer to break down carbs but the energy you gain from it is much more reliable.  athletes often eat a ton of carbs the night before competition so they can draw on that before their competition.  even the day of the competition, they'll be eating lots of carbs prior.\n\nfinally **PROTEIN is LONG-TERM energy**.  it won't do a lot for you immediately but you need it because it is the most sustained energy source, and also is imperative for muscle recovery.  protein contains something called amino acids which is what turns into muscle.\n\nto put it all together, here is the diet of a cross country runner before, during, and after a race.  the night before and leading up to the race they eat a shit ton of carbs to get the mid-term energy to fuel up.  they'll stop eating a few hours before the race, but RIGHT before they might pop a few energy chews (basically sugar chews) to get that extra sugar boost going and they know theyll finish the race before they crash.  finally, after the race, they eat a shit ton of chocolate milk and beef jerky to recover via protein."},
{"title":"ELI5: Is there a biological reason for psychoactive plants?","question_detail":"Like why are magic mushrooms psychedelic? Is that supposed to deter animals from consuming them? What about cannabis or coca? Or do these plants just produce these chemicals just to do it?","answer":"Most of the fun side effects of plants are actually designed to be deterrents to those who would eat the plants. Capsaicin, for example, is spicy to prevent mammals from eating hot chilis, and enough can kill insects, but birds (which eat the seeds and poop them out) don't taste it and are completely unaffected.\n\nSame with psychoactive plants. What sends mammals on a trip can kill bugs and other animals the plant wants to keep from eating it."},

{"title":"ELI5: why does music or a siren that is moving change pitch to somebody that is stationary?","answer":"Doppler effect Wikipedia: \n\n&gt; When the source of the waves is moving towards the observer, each successive wave crest is emitted from a position closer to the observer than the previous wave. Therefore, each wave takes slightly less time to reach the observer than the previous wave. Hence, the time between the arrival of successive wave crests at the observer is reduced, causing an increase in the frequency. While they are travelling, the distance between successive wave fronts is reduced, so the waves \"bunch together\". Conversely, if the source of waves is moving away from the observer, each wave is emitted from a position farther from the observer than the previous wave, so the arrival time between successive waves is increased, reducing the frequency. The distance between successive wave fronts is then increased, so the waves \"spread out\"."},

As electrons are charged particles, they interact with the electromagnetic wave. Specifically, the electrons begin to oscillate, or jiggle, in the \"rhythm\" of the EM wave. This, in turn, generates an electromagnetic wave of their own, as accelerated charges emit EM radiation. The superposition of those two waves, that is: the sum of the two waves, is the resulting net wave passing through the medium. "},

Along the way are intersections for smaller streets that are normally not very busy, and have stop-sign intersections, or have streetlights but don't have left turn lanes large enough to handle event traffic.\n\nIt would be smoother to block these streets so that all traffic focuses on taking the large, arterial street away from the stadium after the game.  You could fit more cars in those closed streets, but because of the small size of those streets, traffic trying to get on and off of it would back up into the arterial street, and slow down the rest of the traffic as well.  Imagine the left-turn lane to that street holds about 7 cars.  After that, cars waiting to get in the lane back up into one of the main lanes of the street.  Then cars stuck in that lane start trying to dart in and out of it to squeeze ahead.  It'd have been better to just close that off so the cars have no choice but to carry on and get away from the congested area."},

There are definite penalties to high Test levels too. \nYou are right that there is much speculation about WHY it worked out this way but the HOW is not a mystery. \n"},
{"title":"ELI5: Why temperature decreases rather than going up while hiking up the mountains?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"When the light from the sun hist the atmosphere most of it goes through it. (You can test this by looking at air and being able to look though air.)\n\nWhen the light from the sun hits the ground it does not pass though, but gets absorbed or reflected back. (You can test this by looking at the ground and not being able to look though it.)\n\nWhen the ground absorbs sunlight it hits up. (Try sitting on a dark park bench that has been sitting out in the sun all day to test this.)\n\nThe ground heats up from the sunlight and slowly radiates the heat away to stuff right next to it such as the air above it.\n\nThe farther from the ground air is the father it is away from the thing that heats it up.\n\nAt higher altitudes the atmosphere gets colder.\n\nThe air also gets thinner and eventually you have a problem with defining how temperature even is supposed to work anyway.\n\nSpace is neither hot nor cold. It is nothing.\n\nVacuum is a good way to isolate things. (To test this try drinking from a thermo flask which will keep cold things cool and hot thing hot.)\n\nIn space you don't really have temperature like that. If something is hit by sunlight in space it gets heated up as it would on earth, but because there is no atmosphere to take some of the heat away easily. a lot more of it will stay trapped than it would on earth.\n\nCooling down satellites and spacecraft is actually a not very minor engineering problem.\n\nHowever that does not mean that space is hot.\n\nIf you manage to stay in the shadow of something in space and not produce any heat yourself an object will become quite cold in space as it slowly looses almost all heat.\n\nThe distance to the sun also hardly matters in this.\n\nEarth is 150 million kilometers away from the sun. The largest mountain on earth less than 9 km tall and airplanes and airplanes fly at altitudes like 12 km or so.\n\nSpace begins at 100 km from the surface and the ISS is at 400 km from the surface.\n\nCompared to the 150 millions of kilometer from the sun even the moon (which is the furthest humans have ever gone) is not really all that much closer or farther away as it is less than 400 thousand km from earth.\n\nIn fact due to the not quite circular shape of the earths orbit. Earth Actually goes from 147,1 million km to 152.1 million km from the sun.\n\nThat is a difference of 5 million kilometer. You would think it would be a lot hotter around here when we are 5 million kilometer closer to the sun, right? Actually the point when we are closest to the sun is in the beginning of January when it si winter for most people and we are farthest from the sun during the height of summer in the northern hemisphere.\n\nThe distance really doesn't matter that much."},
{"title":"ELI5: why is it that when we get really hungry/haven't eaten in a while food no longer seems apetizing?","question_detail":"","answer":"After you've run through the carbs in your bloodstream you revert to 'starvation mode' when your body begins to convert fat into usable energy. In order to make this manageable your brain shuts down the digestive tract and you are no longer 'hungry'.\n\nRight after you run out of carbs you get very, very hungry. A few hours later you aren't hungry anymore because your brain has shut down that part of the body. You will remain not hungry until you eat food (and subsequently run out of blood-stream carbs again) or you run out of fat, in which case you'll get so desperate you'll literally eat babies.\n\nA low-carb diet aims to keep you in fat-burning not-hungry mode until you reach your desired weight, at which point you stop dieting and/or start eating babies."},
{"title":"ELI5: with all of the flooding in Texas how are people not being electrocuted staying in their houses, standing in water near electrical outlets?","question_detail":"","answer":"Electricity takes the shortest path to ground or another conductor. So an electrical outlet on its own is quite safe even if flooded. The electricity will just go between the two live wires or between the live wires to the ground wire. And if there is a short circuit then the fuses will blow rather quickly. There are however unsafe appliances that is not built to specification. A common thing with cheap power supplies for example is to use one of the live wires as a reference and feed it straight out on the output side as ground. This may be safe under normal circumstances as you are likely not touching the ground plane of the device you are using and if you have the right socket type and it is hooked up correctly the wire chosen will be the neutral wire which under normal circumstances is tied to ground. However this leaves a lot of things to chance and you may end up with a live wire that is far from ground wires or wires of different phases. And in this case you might be the shortest path to ground and get electrocuted.\n\nSo proper certified electrical installations and devices will not be able to give you a shock even if the house is filled with salt water and you are directly touching the devices. However you should still be cautious when using electric devices in a wet environment as it is possible that not everything is designed in a safe manner."},

A lawless society with every person fending for themselves?","question_detail":"I'm reading the controversy started by John Jay College professor, Mike Isaacson @vulgareconomics\n\nDo people like him really think they would be better off without police and government? Are they prepared to survive in a society without law and order? \n\nUnless he has an arsenal, his physique doesn't strike me as being capable of holding its own in a lawless society...","answer":"Anarchism is a really broad philosophy with many different schools of thought, all of which have a differing opinions on how society should operate. Generally speaking they all agree that we should dissolve the state, but they disagree on the methodology for doing so. It can range from extreme individualism to complete collectivism. \n\nWhat you're most familiar with are probably Black Bloc types, who fall into the category of Social Anarchists or Anarcho-communism. In a broad sense, they believe that once the workers triumph over the bourgeois, everyone becomes truly equal. Workers would then spontaneously self organize to produce goods in common for all society. All property is communally owned and there are no leaders in the traditional sense. Without the oppressor/oppressed dynamic, the state becomes obsolete and ceases to exist. Rather policy is determined through a horizontal network of voluntary organizations and workers' councils based on the mantra of \"each according to his ability, each according to his needs\". \n\nAnarcho-capitalism takes a very different approach. In this type of society, everything is controlled by market forces through a total open market. All services are provided by private enterprise rather than through taxation and government, and everything is privately owned. Minarchists are a similar group who advocate for a \"nightwatchman state\". Where the state only provides military, police, and courts to protect citizens from bodily harm and enforce property rights.\n\nIndividualist anarchism triumphs the individual in preference to social constructs such as morality, ideology, social customs, etc. It encompasses a number of different schools including free love, objectivism, and naturalism. They tend to shun revolution as a means of bringing about anarchism instead preferring a natural evolution.

{"title":"ELI5: Why do so many people boycott genetic manipulated food?","question_detail":"","answer":"Short story: They don't know what it is and they read an article that said it was bad.\n\nRoundup is not incorporated into the plant. A RESISTANCE is bred into the plant. This resistance actually occurs naturally quite often, just ask a farmer. Weeds can become resistant to nearly anything over time, in a pretty good example of natural selection. Humans sped that up. We're cool like that.\n\nAs far as not being able to plant the same seed you harvest, that's simply a patent. Many commercial varieties are derived from the same germplasm, or at least partly. Universities are constantly doing research on new germplasm, and these become public (assuming a public university \"made\" them). For example, the resistance that most companies breed for sudden death syndrome in soybeans is called Peking. This is a public seed source, that virtually anyone has access to.\nThe cost to a company to actually produce a commercial variety could cross the million dollar mark. A company has several commercial varieties or hybrids. Asking them to essentially release that seed source for free would be like asking Apple to give us the iPhone x just because it's not fair that we have to pay for it.\nSorry for the rambling, and hopefully it's not too incoherent.

{"title":"ELI5: Why does liquid still move freely inside a pressurized container?","question_detail":"","answer":"Objects at the same pressure don't always have the same dencity (weight per unit volume), so heavy substances tend to flow down relative to light ones.\n\nIn addition, the nature of liquids is that individual elements in a liquid flow, and as long as they stay liquid they continue to do so.

{"title":"ELI5: \"Microwave in use\" labeled on microwaves.

I see it on the microwave and I am like \"The microwave is clearly off and not in use so why is it there? Is it referring to the actually \"*micro waves*\"?","answer":"I think it's a health &amp; safety thing. The employee probably needs to label anywhere that microwaves could be flying around, for the usual radiation or radio-interference problems. There's a chance that it's come full circle, and microwave ovens may have that sticker on them already, so the employer doesn't need to label anything.\n\n\nIf you were in specific rooms in a hospital or some kinda science place (TM) then I bet those exact labels would be on doors or walls as well.\n\n\nFun fact: people with hearing aids are often aware of the 'radio wave quality' of a location, with us 'fully functioning' people being completely unaware of it :)"},

How does lightly putting this little chip on someone's skin turn skin cells into other cells? How does the DNA get into the skin and change the cells? Does this have something to do with stem cells, or how they work?","answer":"The chip contains plasmid DNA (little circles of DNA) that codes for genes that will change the cell into a different cell type. The DNA is delivered to cells by an electric field (DNA is negatively charged, so you can push it around with electricity). Electricity also creates holes in cell membranes which allows the DNA to get inside of the cells. Furthermore, the skin must be exfoliated before this process can be used, so dead skin cells are scraped away.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis does have \"something\" to do with stem cells, although at no part in this protocol do they create or use stem cells directly. Classically, to create new cells from a patients tissues, you need to take some skin cells, turn those into stem cells and then turn those stem cells into the cell type that you want. In my understanding, this is mostly accomplished through growth factors which are external signaling molecules that tell cells what to do.

{"title":"ELI5 - why do we have oil glands on our face but not on the rest of our body?","question_detail":"I was thinking that maybe it was because our face was the most exposed body part, but way back they didn’t really have clothing to protect their entire body.","answer":"You do have oil glands over most of your body.  They are more concentrated on your face, because the oils they produce help to prevent bacteria and other germs from entering your body (which happens mostly on your face).\n\nYour distant ancestors that had the oiliest faces and scalps were less likely to die from germs than their cousins.  Their children inherited those oily faces, too, and the traits eventually passed on to us.\n\nThe energy our ancestors' bodies used to make their backs, arms, and palms oily didn't help as much in their survival, so these traits are less common.  In fact, any energy a body wastes on producing things that don't help you survive are actually more likely to kill you, because you have to use up more precious energy just to maintain them."},
{"title":"ELI5- how Hollywood makes fake bodily fluids (blood, vomit, etc)","question_detail":"Title","answer":"There's lots of ways to make fake blood depending on the effect you want to achieve. Hollywood commonly uses non-toxic ingredients. \n\nDuring the days of back and white B-movies, they actually just used chocolate syrup. The very same stuff you put on ice cream. It's shiny and has the right consistency, and is dark enough to look like blood in B&amp;W. Alfred Hitchcock used it in Psycho for example. \n\nKensington Gore, one of the first bloods for colour film, used a 2:1 ratio of golden syrup and water, with red, yellow, and blue food colouring. Corn starch was used to adjust the consistency. It was used in the Hammer Horror films, and later by Stanley Kubrick in The Shining for the famous elevator scene.\n\nThe Dick Smith formulation, made by the famous makeup artist of the same name, is now the standard fake blood used today. It uses corn syrup, water for consistency, and specialized pigments for an opaque look. It also used a preservative agent (for shelf life) and Kodak Photo Flo, which helps the blood spread more evenly. But you can make it yourself with food colouring and zinc oxide or non-dairy creamer to get the right look, and lecithin to replace the Photo Flo, which is sold at some health food stores. \n\nHere's a [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izNg7s3vQOE) from Filmmaker IQ that explains the history as well as some of the recipes used over the years.  \n\n"},

","answer":"Generally they are trying to be sensitive to any issues that the patient might have. They don't necessarily know if you have been an assault victim, or if you have cultural or religious limitations, or if you just don't like a strange man seeing you. Of course, the reverse could always apply but men are far more likely to ask for male staff, whereas women are more likely to just stay silent and uncomfortable. "},

I *feel* like shooting a person, rather than a robot, to Mars would be relatively simple, given the above--after all, each of the major problems, as I understand them, have been solved already.\n\nSo what's the hold-up? What am I/we missing that is keeping us from shooting someone to Mars, say, *tomorrow?*\n\n","answer":"An obstacle that has not yet been solved is how to keep a person healthy for the Mars round trip. You may be interested in the new book by Scott Kelly, who has spent more time in space than any other American, including a whole year in the International Space Station. How to adjust to gravity again after so long in space is a real challenge. Kelly had a lot of health problems to deal with when he got back. Astronauts often have eye problems after being in space, and they're not sure why. They also have heart damage and lose muscle strength and bone density. If their health is destroyed by their trip to Mars, then they may not be able to do what they're supposed to do when they get to Mars (Mars has about 38% of the gravity that earth has). And then when they get back to earth, they might have done so much damage that they've ruined their health. And that's not even mentioning that their risk of cancer is permanently increased due to their trip to space. The extra radiation they'll be exposed to after they leave earth's orbit is worrisome."},

Top dietary sources for these are chicory root, Jerusalem artichoke, dandelion, as well as more common place vegetables such as garlic, leeks, onions, and asparagus. Many other dietary fibers are suspected of being prebiotic but need further research to confirm. \n\nFollowing the metaphor above, you don’t want to suddenly over fertilizer the guilt flora unless you are willing to put up with the side effects of sudden rapid bacterial growth, i.e. bloating and gassiness. It won’t cause any lasting harm but also probably won’t be very comfortable either. Best advice is to slowly start integrating more pre and pro biotic foods into your diet to give your gut time to adjust.\n\nTL;DR If it’s white/green, crunchy, and grows underground it’s probably prebiotic, but too much too quickly will leave you bloated and gassy."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why do drugs that cause serotonin and dopamine rushes mess up the brain and can cause depression after withdrawal but having sex does not?","question_detail":"Crystal Meth has been described to giving an euphoric sensation \"similar to an orgasm\", but natural sex does not cause withdrawal effects, depression even though these chemicals are also released.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHmoSrZW5pY&amp;t=14m50s","answer":"You are aware that there's something called prolactin right? It's basically the counterpart to dopamine when it comes to orgasm. Dopamine tells you to go. Prolactin puts on the brakes and causes the refractory period.  \n\nAlso, having lots of sex does have negative side effects.  \n\nFrom [here](https://www.reuniting.info/content/men-does-frequent-ejaculation-cause-hangover):  \n\n&gt;UPDATE (2014): Researchers have shown that ejaculation, even twice a week, shrinks the dopamine-producing neurons in the VTA, which reduces a male's response to the pleasure of morphine. This also happens with repeated heroin use in both rats and humans.   \n\n&gt;Interestingly, the researchers found that these superstuds didn't get the usual benefit from ejaculation. Normally, ejaculation mellows a male rat, reducing his anxiety for a bit. These guys remained anxious. These rats were also more reactive to drugs than other satiated rats, evidencing signs of low dopamine along the lines of a drug withdrawal.  \n\nThat being said, Crystal Meth is far more addictive than sex (12x times more), and it does destructive things to your brain.  \n\nBasically think about your neurons having parking spaces. With all that dopamine, all parking spaces are taken. Excess dopamine is usually recycled by tow trucks. But as a safety mechanism, the toxic waste crew comes along afterwards and destroys any excess dopamine floating around between neurons. And as a last resort, the brain shuts down those parking spaces (dopamine receptors on the neurons).  \n\nThe problem with Meth is it makes your neurons release all this dopamine. But Meth also fools the tow trucks. So they take away Meth instead of dopamine. Now the toxic waste crew comes in and destroys dopamine. So you lost dopamine that was supposed to recycled. And on top of that your brain eventually shuts down the parking spaces.  \n\nEven without all the other negative effects of Meth, just releasing that much dopamine over and over will cause negative effects, and force the brain to shut down parking spaces. And that leads to anhedonia."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why nobody is fully fluent in Latin","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"Languages change and evolve over time, and mix with other languages until they change beyond all recognition. Apart from a few specialist areas, such as the Catholic Church, where Latin is artificially kept alive in a sort of \"frozen\" state, Latin has evolved so much in the last 2,000 years, it's simply no longer recognizable.\n\nConsider that in only half that time, English has evolved so much that what I am typing now would be gibberish to the writers of the epic of *Beowulf*. In fact, to illustrate the point, here's the opening sentence of *Beowulf*, which was written about the year 1000, give or take a generation:\n\n&gt; Hwæt! we Gar-Dena in gear-dagum, theod-cyninga, thrym gefrunon, hu tha æthelingas ellen fremedon.\n\nLatin has had more than twice that amount of time to evolve, and since it spread out all over Europe, it evolved in different ways in different places.\n\nMostly, it came into contact with other languages: for example, in what is now France it came into contact with Celtic, Gaulish and Frankish languages to become French; further to the south-west, it came into contact with Paleohispanic languages (of which Basque was one) and Arabic to become Spanish.\n\nBut some lesser-known languages survived basically untouched by foreign influences, but they still evolved away from recognisable Latin.\n\nIn the Alps, isolated communities speaking Vulgar Latin were sheltered from the Gallo-Italic and Bavarii cultures, and their languages survive as Ladin, Friulian and Romansh (which is one of the four official languages of Switzerland). In eastern Europe, Roman soldiers brought their Vulgar Latin to the area, where it evolved into modern-day Romanian.\n\nSo, in fact, people are fluent in Latin today. It's just that it's changed so much in the last 2,000 years, it's totally different from the Latin of Cicero."},

{"title":"ELI5:How do normies kill memes?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"For people in a subculture having their own memes can be a helpful way to have an inside reference that only they really get. It help build an identity for a group of people and gives them something to call their own. It can also serve as a quick means of identifying like minded individuals in the world at large.\n\nWhen a meme finds appeal outside that original subculture a lot of these benefits slowly vanish. As the meme moves towards mass appeal it can become disconnected from the feelings and ideals of the original group, and if the meme becomes popular enough it can lead to outright rejection.\n\nWhen a meme has fully made this transition it is \"dead\" to the original group because they no longer use it. It's not a nefarious act by normies, it's just a slow loss of identity brought about by well meaning moms on facebook."},
{"title":"ELI5: why is having your neck broken so often fatal?","question_detail":"","answer":"Easier:\n\nBreaking your _spine_ causes problems. You damage the nerve INSIDE the spine, and you cut off all communication with anything that specific location and everything below it gets cut off. This is why the spine is so protected. If for example I was to break my spine at say my waist, I would not be able to move my legs and likely my bladder, some intestine, etc.\n\nYou cut off the neck communication you cut off communication between the brain and all the body. That includes all things like lungs, etc. Only thing that survives is the heart because it causes its own beating with its own special nerves. Nothing else can get instructions so nothing else moves."},

{"title":"ELI5: How do convection currents and sea-floor spreading work?","question_detail":"Need this for a test in a few days, can anyone please explain? Thanks heaps. There's several explanations online, but I don't fully understand them.","answer":"Convention currents in the mantle work the same as they do in other mediums, just on a much longer timescale than anything we're used to seeing. \n\n\nAs for sea-floor spreading, partially molten mantle material is upwelled at the top of convection currents and the molten bits erupt onto the sea floor forming mid ocean ridges. The dominant forces which contribute to overall plate motion are 'ridge push' away from the ridges (as they are higher than surrounding seafloor and gravity doesn't like this); and 'slab pull' which is likely a bigger force and pulls the whole plate along from the other end where the lithosphere is plunging down into the mantle (again due to gravity).

There would need to be a lot more physical evidence than what is presented in a case like Roy Moore.\n\nHowever, if it's clear that Louis C.K. or Harvey Weinstein have this \"open secret\" where people in the business are aware that this stuff happens, you start seeing this as more of a civil case where it's easier.  (Louis C.K. admitted to the behavior so that's less relevant, but it's an example of people knowing about the open secret).\n\nAnd in the case of Roy Moore, you have people coming forward with circumstantial evidence (like Security guards who knew to watch him at the malls, his signature in a woman's yearbook, etc) to the point where there's probably nothing that will happen in a court, but it's very clear that something happened.

(Marathon runner body) \n\nWhen you stop training it falls back to where you'd be without training, so as to consume as little energy as possible. \n\nThere's something called muscle memory, meaning if you have lifted and falled back, it's easier to gain it again."},

If you destroy their webs they will build a new one, sometimes only inches away from the one you destroyed. \n\nThey have two purposes..eat and reproduce. They eat other bugs, which is great, but not for most humans that hate them. \nA spider will repair a slightly broken web, and if a web seems weak over time, she will strengthen it with new silk, it's hard work. They will also extend their webs out further if needed. Spiders are not an indication of a dirty home, if you have a food source, they will eat. \n\nGetting rid of them depends on the type of spider. Pest control has many options including professional and do it yourself products...not recommended, the chemicals are dangerous and overdoing it makes it ineffective.  Spiders, like many bugs, are killed in one of several ways...respiratory damage by inhalation or direct contact of a specific chemical is most effective (followed by sticky traps, literally squashing them, or direct spray). Bugs groom themselves, but a spiders feet are so tiny, it doesn't pick up enough chemical just walking over a spray you put around your house, to kill it. If you have dangerous spiders I would get a pro involved, if not, vacuum them, squash, sticky board, or direct spraying works. Some spiders are dangerous to animals and humans. \nThey can be a help...they can be a hindrance, you may never get rid of every single one. \n\nSource: worked in pest control\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: what is happening when I’m shopping on my computer, and an hour later the items I was looking up are showing up as adds on social media on my phone?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"Companies like Amazon and Google have multiple ways of tracking you. One of the oldest and most commonly understood is by use of cookies, a small file granted to the visited domain so they can store session information - because http is stateless, you don't keep an open connection with the server; the way they know it's you from one page to the next is through this identifying information.\n\nIt's also why ad space on websites are important, not just for advertising - because if you visit a page that has a Google ad on it, you're also visiting Google at the same time. That means they know which ad space you just accessed on what page.\n\nThey can also track you through browser identifiers - unique strings that identify your browser wherever you go.\n\nSo what you're seeing is called targeted advertising, it's what my wife does professionally for ad agencies, as an analyst. It's neat stuff. You visited a page about shoes, the site has a google ad space, so they now know you've looked at shoes. You go to another page that also has google ad space, and they're going to show you advertisements on shoes there.\n\nHow do they pick the ad? Google, for example, collects everything they possibly can about you, and that information is sanitized and sold *in aggregate*. That means I can't buy information specifically about you, but if I'm an advertiser, I can define a profile, a person, mid 30s, homeowner, just started looking at dish washers - now I start participating in an ad auction for people who fit that profile. I define how much I'm willing to spend per ad, and other bidding properties, and the rest is automated. If I win the bid, my ad for large appliances or maybe kitchen remodeling will be displayed on your browser in that spot. This is done in a fraction of a second for every ad you see on a page."},

{"title":"ELI5: How did Rejewski crack the enigma code using disjoint circles?","question_detail":"I'm making a large project about the Enigma, and I have stumbled upon a document that explains how the enigma was cracked and how he used disjoint circles (?). I'm not a native speaker, but the source I found was in English, so any easy explanation on how disjoint circles work and how they affect the cracking of the enigma code would be greatly appreciated!\n\nEdit: It was supposed to be disjoint CYCLES, but can't really change it now","answer":"I can explain how disjoint cycles work.\n\nA permutation is a distinct arrangement of items in a set.  A distinct arrangement is each unique way to organize those items: if I have a set of three items, I can organize those items six distinct ways (ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA).\n\nA cycle is a way that one permutation turns into another permutation following a set of rules.\n\nComplex ways of turning one permutation into another is normally represented through a matrix (which I'm not going to find out how to format that on Reddit) where the first row is each member of the set and the second row is what each member turns into next, and that matrix would explain that ABC -&gt; BCA -&gt; CAB -&gt; ABC.  This simple cycle can also be notated as (ABC).  For each character in the string, A becomes B, which becomes C, which becomes A.\n\nA disjoint cycle is where there are more than one rule that controls the transformations.  If I have a set of 6 items (let's say the numbers 1-6).  Rule 1 is (1536), meaning 1 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 6 -&gt; 1.  Rule 2 will be that numbers 2 and 4 stay the same, which is notated as (2)(4).  The entire disjoint cycle is notated as (1536)(2)(4).\n\nNow, you have a very basic understanding of disjoint cycles.  Real world examples, like in the case of the Enigma, are very complicated and take a lot of time and effort to solve.  In WW2, there was a large effort lead by Bletchley Park to crack the Enigma.\n\nThe Enigma was effectively a typewriter that encrypted data using three rotors and a reflector plate.  The rotors each contained their own permutation cycles with a possibility that it was a disjoint cycle.  A letter would pass through each rotor, then be bounced off the plate and go back again through each rotor yielding the encrypted letter.  To top that off, each time a rotor was used, the first rotor would shift its encryption by a letter (advancing the second rotor when it made a full rotation, which advanced the third when it made a full rotation).  There were 17576 unique encryptions in total (26^3).\n\nAs for how they solved the Enigma, that's a question for /r/askhistory.  There's lots of math involved, such as knowing letter and word frequency in the encrypted language, finding decrypted notes and their matching encryptions and working backwards, finding an actual encryption device, implanted informants who could give inside information for how things worked, and the likes.\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: The theorem by Lawrence about disjoint cycle permutation.","question_detail":"I'm doing a project on the Enigma from WW2 and I have a tad bit of difficulties understanding the math behind it, especially because my sources are in English which is my second language.\n\nFor reference the theorem is as follows:\nIf H(i)=j ; i.e H=(...i j...); then (T^(-1))HT=(...T(i)T(j)...).\nNotice that this implies that H=(...i j...) and (T^(-1))HT=(...T(i)T(j)...) have the same disjoint cycle decomposition.\n\nNow my English is fluent enough to understand most things, but advanced math is still a bit of unexplored territory, so any explaination of the mathematical expressions would be greatly appreciated!","answer":"H and T are permutations of the alphabet, mapping each letter to a new letter (the new letter is allowed to be the same letter as you started with). T^(-1) is the permutation that \"undoes\" T. If T maps A to B, then T^(-1) maps B to A.\n\nWe can write any permutation as a set of cycles showing how letters are mapped. (ABC)(D)(EF) would map A to B, B to C and C to A, leave D alone, and swap E and F.\n\nT^(-1)HT says \"do T, then do H, then undo T\". The theorem says that when you write this permutation as a set of cycles, it will look like H with the letters rearranged. If H leaves two letters alone, the result will leave exactly two letters alone. If H has one cycle of three letters like (ABC), then the result will have exactly one cycle of three letters. It might be changed to (GXP), but there'll be exactly one.\n\nThis is useful for analysing Enigma because the permutation of letters you get when encoding letters can be seen as    \n(Some stuff)^(-1)(Reflector)(Some stuff)\n\nThe signal goes through all the rotors, then it goes through the reflector, then it goes back through all the same wiring backwards, which \"undoes\" the rotors. So when we write the overall permutation as cycles, it will look like the reflector's permutation with some letters rearranged. But we know that the reflector just swaps pairs of letters, so the overall permutation must swap 13 pairs of letters. Those pairs change each time the rotors advance, but there are always 13 pairs. Since the reflector never leaves a letter unchanged, the whole Enigma machine must never encode a letter as itself."},

What is special about math is that mathematicians tend to look at large sets of questions and answers together. This is often useful to physicists because they will find a question and can look at known mathematical equations to figure out the corresponding answer (or vise versa).\n\nPhysics is also a set of questions and answers but they tend to be about things we see in the real world (or sometimes things we might see if the world was slightly different). In physics this means you can sometimes see a question and its answer but not see the middle part (the equations that relate question and answer). This is sometimes useful to mathematics because knowing both a question and an answer can make it much easier to work out the middle parts.\n\nThe article is about a mathematician using a set of known physics questions and answers to find a math answer because the question he was asking looked the same as a question from physics."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why does the voice on this “That was easy” button slow down when you put it near this plasma doohickey (Video in comments).","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"The button is essentially a small computer playing back a recording.\nAll computers work by performing instructions that make up the program, in this case look for a button press and playback the audio information. \n\nInside the computer is what is known as a clock, this is an electronic circuit that sends pulses to the computer. The computer performs a step of the program for every tick of this clock pulse. In small single chip computers such s in this button, the clock will be ticking at a rate of a couple of million ticks a second. \nNote this clock tick will go up and down by about 5 volts.\n\nA plasma ball works by high voltage exciting the gas in the globe.\nThis voltage is not steady, it swings up and down at a rate of about 35 thousand times a second.\n\nAs this plasma ball voltage is swinging up and down by thousands of volts, it is actually transmitting this voltage through the air like a weak radio transmitter.\n\nWhen the computer button is brought close to the plasma ball, this transmission is received by the clock electronics in the button, and the clock signal is being overpowered by the plasma transmission.\n\nAs the plasma transmission is so much slower that the computer clock, the computer slows down and it play back the audio too slow.\n\nHope that helps."},

If you check the same city on the same day on 3 different websites you get 3 different numbers.\n\nAlso the AQI number seems completely misleading.

The city with the lower AQI is said to be less polluted.\n\nI was lead to believe Nitrogen Dioxide is far more dangerous than particulate matter, as particulate matter can be filtered out with a mask, while Nitrogen Dioxide can't, so why isn't this labeled as a more polluted city?","answer":"The three factors that go into most aqi, or aqhi, are pm2.5, ozone, and NO2, all of whoch have health impacts.\nDifferent places can have different measurements (air quality, especially for NOx, is very volatile)  or different weightings for the equations. A lot of east asian cities have SO2 included, which is pretty nasty, but SO2 levels in most western cities is functionally 0.\n\nAny major metropolitan area is not going to have great air quality, but just try to live a little away from a highway and/or tall buildings and you will be just fine.\n\nI actually research this stuff so let me know if you have questions about it."},

{"title":"ELI5:Why can you see all of the display crystals dimly when you tilt an LCD screen?","question_detail":"Like on a calculator if you tilt it upwards you see a line of 8s across the screen.","answer":"LCDs work by changing the optical polarity of the display element. The display's surface is covered with a polarized film. When no current flows through a display element, the polarity of the liquid inside the display element aligns with the display's surface film, and light can pass through .  When current flows through the element, the liquid crystalizes and polarity shifts to approximmately 90 degrees from that of the surface film, blocking light transmission and causing the element to become visible.\n\nEven when off, the display's polarities don't align perfectly in all planes, so tilting the display can cause it to block light in that particular plane.

{"title":"ELI5:What's the difference between 1080p and hi10p ? What even is hi10p? Why is it used?","question_detail":"Title... ","answer":"Hi10p is a codec, which is a compression format. Digital images are compressed to make them more manageable by reducing the size of the file, like an mp3. Codecs can turn a 4GB raw file into a file that’s only a few hundred MB. The trade off being that there is loss in quality. \n\nOne of the best codecs for video is .H264, which is what Hi10p is encoded with (all Hi10p files are .H264 but not vice versa). The key benefit of Hi10p is that there is less reduction in colour quality of the image while still saving a considerable amount of space.\n\n1080p is a HD picture resolution, HD resolution being 1080x1920. The “p” means “progressive” which is how the picture is displayed. In 1080p the picture is “painted” from top to bottom, line by line progressively. 1080i is interlaced, where the picture is split into two halves called fields, which are composed of every second line. The tv paints one field then the other to make a whole picture. "},

{"title":"ELI5: How does taking deep breaths in and out of brown paper bags ease the anxiety you’re feeling","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"Oh!  I just saw this on Emergency!   When you are anxious you can breathe too fast.  This flushes the CO2 out of your body. Your normal breathing reflex is controlled by the amount of CO2 in your body, so without it, you don't feel the reflex to breathe.  This makes you feel like you're suffocating and you panic and breathe faster.  This, in turn, causes/continues the hyperventilation, and you wind up in a vicious cycle.\n\nBreathing into a bag means you are breathing in the air that you previously exhaled.  With each breath, the amount of CO2 in the bag increases, and each breath of air  you take in with extra CO2 increases the amount in your body.  Eventually you get to the point where the concentration is enough to trigger the normal breathing reflex."},
{"title":"ELI5: What'll happen if you burn a very cold body part?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"Having a cold hand would certainly make it better, but not for long.\n\nWhen you burn your skin, it is because it reached a certain temperature. When your hand/skin is cooler than it's normal temperature obviously you need more heat until you reach the damaging point.\n\nBut then comes the point why hot water causes burns so easily: Water is a fairly good heat conductor. It will heat the outer layers of your skin incredible fast, and while you technically have more time until your skin gets damage, practically it will still cause burns because of how fast the water can transfer it's heat."},
{"title":"ELI5: Why can't we remember our early years of life even though they're extremely important in brain development?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"You can.. you just don't know it.\n\nChildren's most formative years are 0-5.  You might not remember much from that time but your actions as you get older most certainly suggest you do remember..\n\nWere you loved?  Were you abused?  Were you spoiled?  Were you pushed aside and felt abandoned, perhaps raised in a daycare?\n\nLet's say you were spoiled.  Let's say your parents never said \"no\" to you... as an adult you would be inclined to be a person who cannot take no for an answer.  You might be very frustrated with not getting your way at work, or in relationships.  You never learned how to deal with not getting your way.  Maybe you are in debt because you have no self restraint and buy anything you want because you feel entitled.\n\nMaybe you were the first born of several kids and your mom had another kid when you were under the age of 2.  You were pushed aside because the baby needed your mom more than you did.  If she had no family to help this would be worse, but kid after kid it might have reinforced you to feel unloved.  \n\nAll things that happened to you hen you were young do affect you even though you don't directly remember the events.\n\nKeep in mind that your brain was small and had to remember certain things, but not others, it selected what to remember directly and other things entered the subconscious to be buried by new memories."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why you can never truly touch things.","answer":"What we call \"touch\" is really just the repulsion between the negatively charged electron shells of atoms. So when two objects touch, they are really brought to a distance such that the repulsion between electrons is equal to the exterior force. In order to make atoms truly physically touch, you would have to exert an infinite amount of energy, since you would need to bring two similarly charged particles infinitely close (distance of zero)."},

You can also be in the ocean between the Americas and Asia, or in between Africa.

{"title":"ELI5:Why do some stores require a specific amount of money for debit/credit card usage?","question_detail":"Is this a business strategy behind it? All I see is frustration and people not buying more items because they didn't meet the card limit.\n\nEx) One store requires you to have at least a $5 purchase in order to use your debit card.","answer":"Okay.. I know this because my daughter has a store.\n\nDebit cards charge the business a fee EVERY TIME they are used.  It might be 25 cents, or whatever, but it is a flat fee regardless of how big or how small the sale is.  So every time a person pays with a debit card the business is charged that fee (say 25 cents) and they pay it at the end of the month. \n\nCredit cards are different - credit cards charge a percentage of the sale.  Now.. off hand I don't know what that % is, but it depends on the AVERAGE SALES AMOUNT that company has per month.\n\nIf their average sales are lower they get charged a higher % on every transaction.  If their average sales are higher the % is lower on each transaction.\n\nSo you can see if business is an coffee shop they don't want you using your card to buy a $1.75 muffin, but if you are buying a few coffees and sandwiches they are okay with it.\n\nThis is also why most businesses wont give you cash back on credit card sales but will do so on debit sales - the business has to pay a % on the cash they give you back if you are doing it on a credit card."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why does it cost $39 to overdraft your account, or $3 for using a \"foreign\" ATM? What costs does the bank incur for those transactions in order to charge that amount of money?","question_detail":"Is the charge just arbitrary, or are there real costs that are being passed on to bank customers?","answer":"Overdraft fees are about deterrence.  It doesn't cost a bank that much to handle an overdraft, but if customers can bounce checks with impunity, a lot more people will overdraft, and some of them will do it so often they won't be able to pay the money back.  That's it what costs banks money.\n\nATM machines are expensive and cost money to maintain.  The owners of those machines want to turn a profit, so they are usually going to charge fees for using them.  Banks sometimes have deals in play with in-country ATM machines and are less likely to have that some sort of deal with a foreign one.  What's more, exchanging currency isn't free even for banks, and they are like to lose a few percent on the deal, which they pass on to you."},

Well, it's pretty much the same thing that happens with fingerprints, except when the bath is 9 months long, the effect is permanent. Also, fingerprints aren't necessarily unique, they are just random and complex, so it's very unlikely that two people have the exact same pattern."},

{"title":"ELI5: How does the genetic potential of a human work and is there ways to bypass it","question_detail":"Edit title: Are*","answer":"I'm not sure what you mean by 'genetic potential.'\n\nAll of your physical and mental traits are the result of both genetics and environment.  'Environment', in this case, refers to both your social environment / your experiences, and also your physical environment (your diet, what chemicals you are exposed to, what diseases you are exposed to, etc.).\n\nSome traits are more heavily controlled by genes (such as eye color), some are mostly controlled by your environment (such as your taste in music).\n\nI am guessing that you are referring mostly to skills: things that people learn to do, and can get better at, but that some people may seem to have more ability to learn than others.  Things like playing basketball, or mathematics, or social persuasion.\n\nMany skills have a physical / biological component.  For such skills, one's genes can limit or enhance one's ability to learn and practice the skill.  To take an extreme example, someone who is born with a genetic condition that severely impairs their coordination will probably never be able to play basketball as well as someone who was born without that condition.  And by the same token, someone who was born with Down syndrome will probably never be as skilled at mathematics as someone who was born without such a disorder.\n\nThere are many subtle ways that genes can influence our ability to do various things.  Some people, for example, have blood that can carry more oxygen, which gives them an advantage in many sports, especially where endurance is a factor.  And in the realm of cognitive skills, the available evidence shows that somewhere in the neighborhood of 25-50% of a person's ability at any given mental skill is determined by genetics.  But that still leaves 50-75% of their ability being determined by their environment (including how much training, education, and practice they put themselves through).\n\nDoes this answer your question?"},

You've got the fork, which, just like on a bicycle, connects the handlebars to the front wheel, then you have the suspension, which is generally mounted on the fork, generally in the form of one shock absorber on each side.

{"title":"ELI5: Why do women live longer than men? I'd expect the opposite, since post-menopausal traits are the only traits that can never be subject to natural selection- and those are the years that make up the life expectancy difference.","question_detail":"I know that women have a larger sex chromosome that contains some adaptations and immunity and there are a lot of lifestyle factors (smoking, drinking, war) that work against men. But since men can be fertile later than women can, when you think about it, genes that only affect the way women age past menopause *never* evolve for any reason other than random mutation. Why is this not a bigger factor? If men suddenly started becoming fathers at older ages, would we see a shift?","answer":"The \"grandmother hypothesis\" is one that has been put forward to explain why women go through menopause and spend a significant portion of their lives post--menopausally. That is, grandmothers do a lot to help raise their grandchildren, and in that fashion, reproductive success is increased through women living many years without additional fertility. Humans are unique in needing an extremely long number of years of development and the amount of labor required in this task is enormous.\n\nIn addition, there is the issue of large amounts of testosterone having some negative effects, health-wise, in men. Human males who are castrated at a young age have longer life expectancies than males who are not castrated."},

Some required the package to be picked up/moved around. \n\nThe thing here is to remember that the bombs are detonated by an electrical switch.  You complete a circuit, electricity flows, and the bomb goes boom.  In the simplest terms, think of your refrigerator door.  You open the door, and release pressure from a switch, which completes a circuit and turns on the light bulb.  That same principle can be easily applied a mail bomb.  Just replace the light bulb with an explosive device.  "},
{"title":"ELI5: Why do new songs sound so amazing for the first few days when you discover them, and then start becoming dull to listen to?","answer":"Because you know what to expect.

Because you're remembering what it felt like to listen to it for the firs time. Some people are better at never getting tired of the song, and making it feel like it's new every time.

{"title":"ELI5: Why haven't humans shot nuclear waste into the sun yet?","question_detail":"[deleted]","answer":"Shooting stuff into the sun is incredibly hard. The earth orbits the Sun at 30 kilometers per second, and to shoot something into the sun you need to cancel out almost all that velocity. And on top that, you have to get the nuclear waste and an entire rocket that can cancel out that velocity off the ground and into Earth orbit in the first place.

{"title":"ELI5: What is the Reid Technique exactly and why is it considered bad to many critics?","question_detail":"I know about the Reid Technique that is still commonly used for law enforcement across this country. However, why is it considered to be bad to many critics? If so, then what other common techniques does federal, state, and local law enforcement use then instead to yield information from the subject?","answer":"The way the Reid technique works is the interrogators start by trying to act inviting to the suspect, then tell them that the evidence is against them and they want to verify the facts.  They then shoot down all of the person's rebuttals protesting their innocence, and over several hours wear the suspect's resilience down. Then they try to work with the suspect to develop an alternative story in which the suspect can admit guilt while still looking like a reasonable person. \n\nIt's criticized because it relies on stretching the truth, emotional manipulation, and psychologically wearing a suspect down to induce a confession, and it has been known to elicit false confessions that are then used as evidence in court.

And once it's near land, there's a high chance a shoreward wind will blow it ashore, because air over land tends to get warmer and rise, pulling colder air from the sea.\n\nHowever, wind and currents on the open sea are not completely random, and in some places there are circular currents that might keep cloating debris trapped for years, even decades."},

{"title":"ELI5: the difference between financial aid and student loans?","question_detail":"Is it true that you are only eligible for financial aid after you turn 24 yrs, and that you don't have to pay it back?\n\nNote: I am asking about financial aid used for studying in university. \nAlso, I am not American.","answer":"In the U.S., \"financial aid\" is generally a pretty vague umbrella term that covers all of the financial assistance a student can get for college outside of private loans (student loans, scholarships, grants, etc.). Student loans obviously have to be payed back, but how much of a \"financial aid package\" is made up of loans versus \"free money\" like scholarships varies from student to student. The big \"sticker amounts\" on some financial aid packages can be very misleading if *most* of that money is from loans. \n\nAs for age, you don't have to be 24 to be eligible (most students start university, and start getting financial aid for it, when they are around 18), but loans generally need a co-signer who is more financially secure: the school/financial aid agency/bank doesn't trust some 18 year-old kid who *says* they'll be able to pay all that money back, so someone else (usually a parent/guardian) is on the hook for it as well.

{"title":"ELI5: Does frying vegetables negate their health benefits completely? Or is there something still to be gained from eating them","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"Vegetables are considered healthy because:\n\n - their high fiber content helps digestion\n \n - their nutritional value (vitamins/minerals/dietary fiber) is high compared to their caloric value. \n\n\nIn other words, they are full of good things and not very full of bad things.\n\nFrying generally adds caloric value in the form of fats absorbed into fried food. It also might cause some of the healthy parts to break apart into less useful things at high temperature. Usually fried food is also salted, which can be unhealthy. \n\n\n\nIn general, veggies are healthier when they are fresh. But if fried veggies are what get them to be eaten, just do so lightly and try to drain any excess oil before serving. "},
{"title":"ELI5: what specific chemicals are in alcohol to make it have an effect on the human brain?","question_detail":"[deleted]","answer":"Well when you drink alcohol, the main chemical that causes effects on you is ethanol.\n^(C ₂ H ₆ O, with the structural formula: CH ₃CH ₂OH, where -OH is the functional group (flexing my alcohol knowledge I apologize))\n\nThe ethanol has a free pass through your body as it’s molecules are so tiny, and once it gets into your digestive system it can enter your bloodstream and go through your heart and into your brain as it can pass through the gaps between cells because of its size. \n\nWhile in the brain, ethanol causes the dopamine release (what makes you feel good when drunk) and it also becomes a nervous system depressant, meaning that it slows your brain activity, and can make you feel sleepy.\n\nIt links up with nerve receptors (the things that deal with information in the brain), particularly one called glutamate - a transmitter that normally “excites” neurons to get information around the brain. The ethanol stops it from being active which in turn slows down your reaction speeds and processing power of your brain. \nIt also activates gamma aminobutyric acid receptors, which decreases your brain’s functions even more and makes you feel sleepy as well.\n\nWhat this means is that as your processing power slows down, your body functions will slow down, making you walk wonky and off-balance, as well as slurring your speech and causing unnatural emotional responses to events (such as becoming tearful or aggressive for no reason, or feeling like dancing naked on a table is a good idea).\n\nDrinking too much alcohol will cause such a decrease in brain function that the brain will “forget” to remind the heart and lungs to pump blood and breathe, which can eventually kill you."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why don't animals hurt their eyes more considering they are not recessed?","question_detail":"The eyes of most animals are not recessed like found in people, yet rarely have visible injuries. What prevents them from getting hurt more being so much more exposed? Thinking something as simple as a cat playing with its claws, 1 scratch would easily damage my eyes. ","answer":"I’m going to go with the *nictitating membrane* aka “Third Eyelid”— a protective feature many animals have, which humans do not. The 3rd eyelid is like a clear screen cover for the eye, which you probably have never noticed on your pet dog, cat, horse, etc because it usually slides across during a blink/wink (“nictitate” means wink). But if your pet has had a sedative she might let the 3rd eyelid sort of hang out. or sometimes an animal just plain needs to clean her eye, or just goofs up and then you can see this freaky clear dome slide across. \n\nsource: James Herriott novels.

{"title":"ELI5: Scientific publication paywalls; why do the exist and is there any modern alternative","question_detail":"","answer":"Basically, it costs money to run the various scientific journals, particularly when you factor in the fact that a fair amount of the staff who run said journals are expensive to hire (e.g. PhD holders and various researchers). Someone has to pay the costs associated with publishing the work.\n\nThe traditional one is what you've seen; the paywall. Publishing is free, but access is limited and requires a subscription. Universities typically buy access to groups of journals (typically, they'll just have a deal with one of the major publishers for access to all of their stuff).\n\nA newer alternative is to publish open-source, but typically this comes with a fee that the authors of a given paper will have to pay, often to the tune of hundreds if not thousands of dollars depending on the research area and the journal in question, which isn't reasonable for most researchers.\n\nAnother problem is that open-source is riddled with scams, particularly with respect to engineering fields. The journals will offer free open-source publishing with \"expedited peer review\" (which is to say; no peer review), but in return you effectively cede all IP from that paper to the journal, in addition to ownership of the paper itself (normally you just give copyright, but the paper is still considered to be \"yours\"). These journals will often also demand extra fees after publishing the paper in order to keep it accessible; as soon as you stop paying, they pull the paper, and you can't republish it with plagiarizing yourself."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why did doctors try to save JFK when his his head practically exploded?","question_detail":"","answer":"Because:\n1) that's their job\n2) They didn't and couldn't know the full extent of the damages before treating him. \n3) Doctors go to insane lengths to save important people. For example, George Washington's doctors killed him in their efforts to save him (he was a former president at the time). He was sick with what may have been the flu or something similar--it doesn't seem from descriptions that it would have been fatal--and they used their best technique at the time to treat him, which was bleeding. But they went to excessive lengths, lengths they wouldn't go to with other people, and in consequence drained him of more blood than a body can lose (as demonstrated by the doctors' own records of their treatment of him). They bled him to death. Another example: President James Garfield was shot in office, and it's widely regarded that the excessive treatments his doctors subjected him to may have killed him. In Kennedy's case, we know now nothing could have saved him, and medicine was certainly at a much better level in 1963 than it had been at the times of the doctors above who damaged their patients in the past by their primitive efforts. But the point is, they went to the most extreme levels available to them at the time in their efforts to save his life, just as doctors of the past did when they were treating another president or recently ex-president. Likewise, when Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon suffered a small stroke, doctors may have given him too high a dose of blood thinners in an effort to treat that problem as well as a heart issue they uncovered at that time, resulting in a much more serious stroke a short time later. He basically lost all cerebral function from that stroke, but while with a regular person they might have a DNR decision, they went to extraordinary measures to keep him alive. So he was in a persistent vegetative state for 8 years until he finally died."},

{"title":"ELI5:How and why did caskets get their hexagonal shape?","question_detail":"","answer":"Cost savings just does not seem right, knowing which end the head is at meant a lot back in the day when they still had horse and Buggies and would use that as a hearse. Learned a little about that when I became a paramedic firefighter and they explained it to us in our paramedic class. Back in the olden days a coffin was always put on the buggy with the head toward the front. This way when they pushed the coffin off buggy into the hole the feet would go in first. That was a sign that a person was a respected individual. If you placed the coffin on the buggy with the feet toward the front it meant you were a disrespectful person, and when they pushed you off the buggy into the hole you went into the hole head first. That is the reason why ambulances have stretchers mounted in the back the way they are. Back in the early nineteen-hundreds hearses were used as ambulances so you were loaded in and out the same way if you were a live patient or if you were in a coffin. Once things progressed and hearses were not used for ambulances anymore, the loading of the patient with the head toward the front just carried over into the ambulances. It would be much better if a patient was in the back of the ambulance facing forward when you were moving because it would prevent a lot of motion sickness, but ambulances were and still are built to have the patient's head in first which is where all the primary things used in an ambulance are mounted (toward the front.)"},

{"title":"ELI5: Can someone explain Newtons three laws?","question_detail":"I know this is maybe a stupid question and probably common sense. But I need to know how they all three work without overcomplicated words and maybe some examples of how they work. If this question has already been answered please don't hate, just send me the already answered question. Thanks!","answer":"They are absolutely not common sense. If they were common sense, the guy who wrote them down wouldn't still be a household name four hundred years later.\n\nNewton's First Law states that objects won't change their motion unless an unbalanced force acts on them. This is not how we see things work in our everyday lives. Objects that roll come to a stop on their own. Projectiles slow down. Running becomes difficult after a while. It looks like the natural state of things is to be at rest. Newton realized that external forces like gravity, friction, and drag were the only reason that these  objects in motion were slowing down. He realized that if someone threw a projectile in an environment with neither air nor gravity, it would keep moving at the same speed in a straight line forever, or until some other force pushes or pulls it.\n\nNewton's Second Law is something you see in your everyday life, but people might not have noticed that the math behind it was so simple. You often hear it phrased \"Force equals mass times acceleration\" or *F=ma*. In a sense this sounds like \"force is determined by mass and acceleration.\" But that's not how Newton phrased it. Newton phrased it more like \"The acceleration of an object is determined by the object's mass and how hard you push/pull it.\" It's the same three ideas -- F, m, and a -- but the cause and effect relationship is clearer here. If you exert the same force on two different objects of different mass, the smaller mass is gonna move more than the bigger one. \n\nNewton's Third Law is the hardest to grasp, partially because we phrase it so poorly when trying to explain it. If one object is pushing on another, then the other object pushes back with the exact same force. If Han Solo is doing a space walk and shoves the Millennium Falcon, then the ship pushes back on him with the same exact force. But hopefully Han has himself tethered to the ship, because the *Second* Law tells us that because Han has a small mass, that force will accelerate him much more than it accelerates the ship. He's gonna go flying off and the ship is gonna barely move."},

{"title":"ELI5: What causes your skin to burn in the sun and how does your body create/break down vitamin D?","question_detail":"","answer":"Your skin doesn't actually \"burn\" in the sun in the same sense that it burns if you touched a hot stove. The sun emits light at different wavelengths, and the different wavelengths carry different amounts of energy. Luckily, the earth's ozone layer and it's magnetic field manage to block the majority of the high energy light that could damage us if it hit us, but some of it still gets through. \n\nUltraviolet light is light that has just a slightly shorter wavelength, and thus more energy, than the light that makes things look purple. Because UV light has more energy, it can penetrate a little bit further into things before it gets stopped. Specifically, this means that UV light can penetrate our skin, and the energy it carries with it gets absorbed into our bodies. \n\nIf the UV light passes through a cell's DNA, it can scramble or break the DNA in that cell, which can cause all sorts of problems. Sometimes the cell will die, sometimes the damaged cell will start multiplying itself uncontrollably, which is what cancer is. Either way, skin cells damaged by UV light typically need to be cleaned up or killed by the body. When a lot of your skin is damaged by this UV light, your body pumps extra blood into the area to help clean out the dead and damaged cells. This extra blood causes your skin to become red and sensitive, and warm to the touch, which is what a sunburn is! \n\nSo, a sunburn isn't a burn caused by the sun, it's your bodies way of trying to clean up and heal damage caused by the sun. \n\nSometimes, though, the UV light doesn't just hit your cells, it can hit a specific type of cholesterol found in your skin called 7-dehydrocholesterol. When this absorbs the energy from the UV rays, it turns into cholecalciferol and enters your blood. Eventually, it will reach your liver, which will turn it into hydroxyvitamin D, and then it will finally be turned into dihydroxyvitamin D by the kidneys."},

{"title":"ELI5: What happend to the 78% Nitrogen in the air that we breathe in? Does it get into our blood via diffusion the same way Oxygen does?","question_detail":"","answer":"0xygen is used by the human cells for various metabolic activities and in the end you have CO2 as a waste product. \n\nThey get transported through the blood by several mechanisms. \n\nIn general all gases cause a spec pressure in a given place at a spec temperature. For every Gas this differs. \nIf you have two rooms and seperate them by a thin wall (membrane) and in one room you put a gas lets say oxygen and the other one is completely empty this gas will diffuse to the other side till the partial pressure in both rooms is the same. \nThis is why O2 diffuses into your blood. Your cells use 02. This leads to less O2 in the blood. 02 from the outside through the lung alveoli diffuses into the blood and is transportet again to the cells.\n\nNitrogen is not used by any of our cells nor is it anywhere produced in us. So the partial pressure of Nitrogen never changes in the blood. It is lets say equal to its athmospheric partial pressure. So it will never diffuse freely to your blood since there is nothing forcing it.\n\nAll 78% are breathed out again."},
{"title":"ELI5: As someone who has an anxiety disorder (hypochondria) and has had every test (2 EKGs, 2 CBCs, D Dimer, Troponin, chest X-ray, holter monitor, echocardiogram) why is it that I feel the physical symptoms of anxiety even though I don’t feel anxious? Meaning things like chest tightness , etc?","question_detail":"","answer":"This is probably a better question for r/askscience.  \n\nBut I'll give it a whirl.  I'm a Neural Network Programmer, not a scientist per say, so I'm going to take my best shot.  Neurons in the brain have fluid states between very little signal and full signal.  Many factors can affect them physically such that it's not simply behavioural psychology, it's an imbalance that is often a runaway effect in which what the neurons are doing may affect the chemical outlook of the brain, which in turn may affect what the neurons are doing.  So my understanding of what happens in anxiety and depression patients is that there are a few areas of the brain that get very highly trained.  They can either suck up all the serotonin, norepinephrine, both, or sometimes other affective hormones or regulators of the brain.  That's why you see depressive and anxious brains that are (highly active in a couple areas but inactive in others.)[https://www.google.ca/search?q=depressed+brain+vs+normal+brain&amp;rlz=1C1ASUC_enCA637CA637&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjzmdG834jbAhUj64MKHZ2wD_IQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=987]  \n\nSSRIs and SNRIs are often prescribed to people with depression anxiety disorders of all sorts.  They prevent the re-uptake of Serotonin and Norepinephrine respectively.  What that means is they prevent those highly active areas of the brain from sucking up too much of the affective regulators of the brain.  This, in turn, leaves enough for the rest of the brain.  Since both promote regular activity, what's often happening in the brain of anxious or depressed people is that some part of the brain that handles emotions, fears, specific situations, rationalizing, etc is not active enough and thoughts can persevere instead of getting handled.  Since behaviourly this can have a lasting effect even after the reuptake is addressed (in a sense, even now that the hardware is working, the software that was made when it was not working properly has to be addressed) most doctors will prescribe therapy as well to get the behaviour of how one thinks about things back to normal.\n\nChest tightness, dryness of mouth, headaches, shaking, sweating, feeling light headed. . . are symptomatic of anxiety.  It's just one's brain telling the body to get ready to respond to a dangerous stimulus.  In hypochondria and most types of anxiety disorders, the danger is being vastly overestimated by one's brain and the areas that handle it are both underactive as well as undertrained (since they have been underactive and the host doesn't have time on the clock thinking about it in a healthy way).\n\nHaving dealt with depression and anxiety myself, and hypochondria playing role in it, as well as some other more predominant social anxieties, in my particular case medication has helped a great deal.  Once the medication was adjusted for dose, I found myself waking up 4-5 months after I started and just not giving a f@#$ about things that used to pain me drastically. That was just an amazing feeling!  Seeing someone to go over thought processes has really opened my eyes to what was affected by it, and allowed me to slowly chip away at some of those behaviors, with lots of success.\n\nSo to summarize answer your question. . . if it's anxiety disorder causing the physical symptoms of anxiety, even if you don't feel anxious per say, it's because of the nature of how anxiety is related to the governing regulators of the brain and the effect they can have on the activity of the rest of the brain, including maximizing or minimizing the parts of your brain which control the physical responses of your body, even if you're processing perfectly socially.\n\nGreat question, best of luck with your journey!"},

{"title":"ELI5: Where does machine learning take place in a computer?","question_detail":"Is it in RAM (in which case, the learning would be lost if the computer is powered down), or does the computer have some way to save what it's learned, and if so, how?","answer":"Software developer here,\n\nThere's no one place machine learning takes place. The bytes that represent the learning are meaningless without the program that interprets and acts upon them, and vice versa, the algorithms are useless if it can't store \"state\" and \"remember\" from past input.\n\nMemory in a computer is sequential - each byte has a unique address, from 0 onward to 2^63-1, the max because each address is 8 bytes. This lends naturally to storing sequential, contiguous arrays of bytes, like if you had a list of integers.\n\nBe that as it may, you can represent multi-dimensional data through clever organization. For example, you can organize a 2D array in sequential memory by subdividing the 1D array into subsequences for each row. A 3x3 matrix would be an array of 9 elements, and the first 3 are the first row, the next 3 are the second row, and the last 3 are the third row.\n\nYou can get even more clever, if you store bytes of data, and then memory addresses themselves as data. So if you imagine a graph, nodes and edges/vertices, then the nodes can contain some data point, and then a list of edges, which are just memory addresses to other nodes. You can imagine if you have as your data any one node, you can follow the memory addresses to get to any other node that diverges from that point in the graph.\n\nSo how is the learning stored? That depends on the algorithm. Much of computer science relies on linear algebra, so the data can be stored as large arrays as vectors or multi-dimensional arrays as discussed above as matrices.\n\nOne AI I once programmed used neural nets. Each neuron consisted of a single value, called the weight, and my net was a strict structure, so I just stored these values in an array, it was easy to compute how the neurons logically mapped to one another and where their corresponding weights were in the array. How these learn is the input changes the weight, and the weight adjusts the value of the corresponding output.\n\nOther algorithms can be quite complex and require graph structures to model their associations.\n\nNone of this talks about how the algorithms make sense of the data, so how it's stored may make very little sense.\n\nIn the long term, the software may save the values to disk. It's all just bits and bytes, whether it's in memory or on disk. Typically a program will \"serialize\" the information, or replace some of the data that only makes sense when the program is running for that instance - memory addresses; they're likely going to be entirely different if the program restarts."},

{"title":"ELI5: What is a Power over Ethernet Interface Module","question_detail":"I saw one of these at work connected to a conference phone and was curious about what it’s for and how it works. Saw a patent on the tech but I didn’t really understand it. ","answer":"The more technical answer...\n\nEthernet cable \\(Cat\\-4, Cat\\-5, Cat\\-6, etc.\\) contains 8 wires in four pairs.  For Ethernet speeds below 1 Gigabit, only two of these pairs are used to carry the Ethernet bits.  Gigabit Ethernet uses all four pairs.\n\nPower\\-over\\-Ethernet \\(POE\\) uses the spare two pairs on sub\\-Gigabit Ethernet to  power remote devices like IP cameras and telephones.  The standard POE voltage is 48 VDC, so the device at the end has to \"get what it needs\" from this \\-\\- convert it to 12V, 5V, etc.\n\nPOE can be done a number of ways.  There are Ethernet switches \\(typically not routers\\) that will generate the 48 V right where you plug in and there are also inline power injectors that can be used.  At the remote end, either the device handles the 48V, or you can buy POE splitters of various voltages to get the voltage you need; typically 12V or 5V. \n\nThe beauty of POE is that it gets you out of running a separate power line for your device.  The downside is that it's incompatible with Gigabit and faster speeds and power is limited.\n\nTechnically, what you saw on your conference phone is probably POE splitter.  It splits the Ethernet from the power at the remote end of the Ethernet cable.  It may also be a simple power supply to get around the fact that your Ethernet line has no power.  If any part of this is plugged into a 110 outlet, it's a simple power supply. "},

{"title":"ELI5:Can someone explain me the concept of gravity assist?","question_detail":"If I understand well, gravity assist is when you use the gravity of an object with significant gravity(sun/planet) to propel another object in a given direction though I'm a bit confused by this concept. If we use the Sun as an example of an object of strong gravity and a comet as the object that will be using gravity assist, what makes it that the comet doesn't go right into the Sun instead of getting propelled elsewhere?\n\nAlso, I'm not sure if the concept of gravity assist is only a term used for our own rockets/ships or if it's appropriate to use it also with comets and asteroids...","answer":"Any two objects not orbiting each other, that come close to each other, will gravity assist each other.\n\nThis will not change their overall speed (any gained as they're coming together will be lost as the move away), however, their original orbits will be altered; they will each leave the encounter in a different direction.\n\nThe closer they are at their nearest point, the more their orbit will be changed. The biggest change to their orbit will occur if they collide, though I'm not sure it's still called a gravity assist at that point.\n\nA large object will alter a small object's orbit more than the other way around. So, I assume there must be a limit where it's not called a gravity assist if the change in orbit is small enough. That is, I guessing a little asteroid is not said to gravity assist a huge planet simply because the change to the planet's orbit is so tiny.\n\nAn asteroid in orbit around the Sun cannot be gravity assisted by the Sun, but one orbiting the galaxy that comes near the Sun will leave the Solar System in a different orbit, so that's a gravity assist."},

Shouldnt the power of these nuclear weapons also at the very least shake whatever structure the camera is on? ","answer":"Mostly they are far enough so that it doesn't matter. Zoom lenses are a wonderful thing.\n\nThere are sometimes cases of cameras being put close enough to suffer some damage. The way they get around this is by building a bunker for the camera. [Here's a photo of a camera bunker from the Trinity test](https://twitter.com/wellerstein/status/988536394330071040) — the whole thing is made of concrete, and the cameras face upwards, with a mirror then directing them to the test. So even if the blast wave did sheer off of the mirrors or something, the cameras would be unhurt.\n\nNuclear effects are _very_ powerful near the fireball (ground zero).

Our atmosphere is like a thick blanket wrapped around the Earth, insulating it and slowing down the heat from evaporating away during the night. It simply does not spend long enough facing away from the Sun to lose all the heat energy that the land and oceans absorbed while facing the Sun.

For example, one of the oil molecules that makes up sunflower oil is called 'oleic acid', and it contains 18 carbon, 34 hydrogen, and 2 oxygen atoms. This process, of building big molecules out of smaller ones, requires energy that the plants get from sunlight. \n\nThe plant makes these molecules as a way of storing energy for later. It uses the energy from the sunlight to make the bonds that are necessary to hold these big molecules together. Later, the plant can destroy these bonds again, releasing the energy and making it available to do things with (e.g. to build materials to allow the plant to grow). Or, we can eat the plant instead, and then we get to use the energy in its sugars and oils.\n\nSo plants make oil by rearranging the atoms of water and carbon dioxide into larger molecules. And note that the carbon dioxide doesn't actually come from the ground, it comes from the air. So if you see a bottle of sunflower oil, it's interesting to think that a lot of that stuff actually came out of the air, just like the air that you breathe."},

Appropriately, the definition of fractals is a bit fuzzy around the edges, but the key thing is that they have a [fractal dimensionality](http://charles.vassallo.pagesperso-orange.fr/en/art/dimension.html) (which is to say, something like a [koch curve](http://blog.zacharyabel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/TM-turtle-koch.gif) is a line, but has so much complexity you can almost think of  its dimension as being somewhere in between a 1d line and a 2d surface).  Fractals are also self similar, in the sense that you can take a chunk of them, zoom in on it, and it will look similar to the fractal as a whole.  You can basically zoom in forever and keep seeing detail, which is not something that works with, eg, a regular polygon.  \n\nEmergence, on the other hand, is basically about the idea that the interactions between parts can create complexity that isn't apparent at the lower level...it's roughly speaking the idea that the whole is more than the sum of the parts.  There's a bunch of philosophy about what that really means which I am not qualified to talk about, but as a _practical_ matter, you often get emergence when simple rules of interaction between simple objects produce behavior not described in the rules.  For example, [boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) is a computer program designed to emulate bird flocking (and we have reason to believe bird flocks and fish schools _do_ work rather similarly to this way).  Boids [form groups](https://youtu.be/9gTjJxgBH5U?t=12) and move in a cohesive manner, but the rules that run the boids say include nothing at all about the nature of these groups.  Instead, the rules are a simple set that tell each boid to try and maintain a set distance from its neighbor and move in a similar direction.  The groups emerge from the rules. \n\nLikewise, the rules describing the physical interactions of sand particles don't say anything about sand dunes, but they produce sand dunes under the right conditions.  \n\nYou can build fractals using emergent rulesets, so I guess that's a connection between the two."},

{"title":"ELI5 how do sailboats sail against the wind?","question_detail":"","answer":"They \"tack\".\n\nWhat they do is point at a diagonal direction into the wind, with the front angled like this.

Basically, the water on the right side of the boat forms a sort of \"wall\" that causes the boat to \"squirt\" forward rather than just travel down, in the same way that if you press down on a grape seed on a table it'll squirt out rather than go straight down.\n\nThe boat travels in this way for a while and then tacks - changes direction to the upward-left. It does this over and over until it reaches its destination, following a sort of zigzaggy line. \n\n\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: What's the difference between all the H_N_ diseases?","question_detail":"","answer":"Strains of influenza are characterized by two proteins that are on the outer surface of the virus: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) Hemagglutinin is how the virus attaches to and infects cells, sort of like a key opening a door. The neuraminidase is what allows newly synthesized viruses to escape the cell and spread to go infect other cells. There are several types of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase that can create 144 subtypes of Influenza A (ignoring B and C), from H1N1 to H9N16 and the H and N numbers represent which ones the virus has (each virus has one type of H and one type of N). When a person becomes infected with the influenza virus, their body's immune system responds by making antibodies to the specific H and N proteins, which then bind to the proteins, and block them from doing their job, stopping the virus in its tracks. When giving a flu vaccine, it  must match the expected type of flu that will be circulating, because a vaccine for Influenza H3N2 won't protect against Influenza H7N9 for example.\n\nTl;dr - H and N are 2 proteins that the influenza virus uses to make you sick. The H and N numbers indicate which of specific proteins the virus has."},

{"title":"ELI5: If there is a salary cap in the NBA, how do the same teams stay strong and up the top for many years in a row? Non American here.","question_detail":"","answer":"Whether a team can stay up top depends on how they manage their contracts. Players usually try to get as much as possible and you see much less often in NBA, players taking less money for the sake of team flexibility and for possibility to attract (and pay) star free agents. You see this in the NFL like Tom Brady being paid very little compared to other top QBs. Teams can go over the salary cap but they are penalized heavily, however despite hefty luxury tax for going over the salary cap, many teams are currently over the cap. For isntance, I am an OKC Thunder fan and they just traded away Carmelo Anthony because they were going to have to pay him over 20 million dollars.  When they traded him they actually saved around 100 million dollars because they now are not so far over the cap and save a big luxury tax penalty.\n\nThe main thing that keeps a team at the top is if they minimize inflated contracts. There are alot of players getting paid way more than they are worth. The teams staying at the top avoid these kinds of deals. Usually teams that cant attract big stars end up paying more for less. Perfect examples of this is the Chicago Bulls goving big money to Zach Levine and Jabari Parker.\n\nHope this helps a little. "},

{"title":"ELI5: What is it about \"artificially low\" interests rates that causes concerns of a big recession?","question_detail":"","answer":"I think one of the theories about the 2008 \"Great Recession\" is that the ongoing low interest rates at the time made it so cheap for banks to borrow money that it created a low enough risk that they extended credit to higher risk borrowers. From what I recall (and someone correct me if I'm wrong), so-called \"liar loans\" allowed higher risk people to get mortgages they really didn't have the income to support. They were able to get them at low interest rates that would balloon later—I think a lot of them didn't understand this or thought they could refinance later on to maintain lower rates. So now you've got all these people with bigger mortgages than they can really afford buying houses, which means higher demand for houses pushes housing prices up. So now we've got higher housing prices being purchased by people whose mortgages are basically ticking time bombs because when those payments go up, they won't be able to afford to keep up. There will be too many of these defaults for banks to handle and it will cause a chain reaction.\n\nIf you go further, you get into the mortgage-backed securities, credit default swaps, misleading bond ratings, and more that all blew up and created the worst recession since the Great Depression—and it largely goes back to the low interest rates and irresponsible lending in the mortgage industry. At least, that's what I've been able to make of the whole mess."},

{"title":"ELI5: what’s stopping me from dropping dental insurance right after getting a bunch of work done?","question_detail":"","answer":"well first off with dental insurance, there is a waiting period before you can have any work done. This makes you pay into the system for a bit of time, so that they make sure they get some money up front\n\nSecondly, dental insurance does not cover procedures 100%, except basic cleanings. The expensive procedures are covered at 50% or less. Some procedures are only covered at 20%. So if you're looking at expensive work, you're going to pay a lot out of pocket so that the insurance company is not actually out much money.\n\nThirdly, dental insurance has a maximum yearly amount that they will pay. And that amount is pretty low when you consider the costs of many dental procedures. So you're actually not able to get a bunch of stuff done in any one year, it has to be spread out over time. "},

{"title":"ELI5: How does 'New Home Economics' work?","question_detail":"I can not for the life of me seem to wrap my head around it. I need to understand it for a class, but I come from a background in history, so a lot of the basic concepts are lost on me. I definitely feel like I'm five. ","answer":"New Home Economics (I've only ever heard \"Household Economics\" or \"Economics of the Family\", fwiw) deals primarily with un-priced transfers and labor *within* the household (Miliean's response is insightful but may leave you with the impression that the big innovation was accounting *between* workers/households). \n\nConsider, for example, the question of labor supply. Both members of a household could earn a given wage if they worked outside the household, and they use the money they earn to buy consumption goods. However, working outside the household takes time, and meanwhile there is a lot of time-intensive work to be done within the household (cooking, cleaning, and especially childcare). With a wage structure from 100 years ago where (for whatever reason) men's wages are substantially higher than women's, you might find that the optimal solution for the household is for the man to specialize on market labor and the woman to specialize on household labor. With the current wage structure, the differences between men and women are small enough that you occasionally see households where the women specialize in market labor instead. You might also see situations where both household members work in the market and use their extra earnings to buy household labor (nannies and housekeepers, etc.) The basics of the NHE labor supply argument is that you can explain the division of household labor as a rational response to prices and incentives faced by the household rather than as a pure product of social mores. \n\nThere are lots of other applications of this sort of thinking. What kinds of families have children and when? How do households split the consumption that they purchase? How to people decide who to pair up with in the first place? There's too much to cover in just one post. Gary Becker's \"Treatise on the Family\" is basically the foundational text of the whole field. It lapses into economic modeling, but there's enough prose to get the intuition behind each of the models. "},

How does this coating repel or kill germs without needing to constantly be reapplied?","answer":"Another type of antibacterial surface is superhydrophobic coatings. The surface is sprayed with water-repelling polymers, which prevents the bacteria from  reaching the surface through water droplets. Most bacteria also cannot attach themselves to the surface because they are adapted for water environments and repelled away.\n\nThis surface is fairly cheap to produce, you can dip most materials in the hydrophobic polymer and it’s done. Kind of like how you can make your shoes/clothes/phone water resistant with those hydrophobic sprays."},

Hearing works in a similar way. We have 2 ears that are separated from each other. That gives us \"depth perception\" of sound the same way that having 2 eyes gives us depth perception of sight. Our brain analyzes the differences in sound from each ear (including the difference in time it takes a sound to reach each ear) and determines where the sound came from. "},

{"title":"ELI5: Why can't we contain an actual thermonuclear explosion in a tokamak to archive practical nuclear fusion?","question_detail":"","answer":"Tokamaks can't contain such a thing, as others have pointed out, but there are other forms of fusion work being done. Inertial confinement fusion essentially involves making a tiny thermonuclear explosion (e.g., using a laser the size of a football field to compress and ignite a fusion pellet the size of a pea) inside of a chamber, and then siphoning off some of the energy it produces. \n\nIt's very hard to do at all (your laser has to be very powerful and the compression of the pellet has to be very perfect), and it's very hard to do in a way that produces net energy (only a small fraction of the energy put into the laser reaches the pellet, and that means your pellet really has to \"burn\" well), but it is one of the approaches that has been investigated. (Several large facilities, like the National Ignition Facility in the USA and the Laser Megajoule in France, are dedicated to this kind of research.)"},

{"title":"ELI5- What’s the difference between progressive and interlaced editing?","question_detail":"In video editing, what do progressive and interlaced mean? ","answer":"Video frames can be seen as rows and columns of pixels.\n\nOn a progressive scan, rows are drawn one by one from top to bottom.\n\nOn an interlaced scan, rows are drawn from top to bottom, *twice*; once for the odd rows, once for the even rows.  Because only half the rows get drawn at each scan, the scan gets to be two times faster.\n\nWhy does interlaced scan exist, is it not just pointless complexity?\n\nWell, the first TVs were not that good, and their screen pixels would quickly lose luminosity once hit by the CRT beam; a progressive scan then would have made TVs unbearable to watch because of the blinking effect.  Interlacing reduced that effect.  That's one of the reasons why over-the-air analog TV signals were interlaced.\n\nAlso, even if the number of pixels per second is the same, an interlaced scan will give the impression of a better frame rate, because the brain gets fooled into thinking the *whole* image gets updated twice as fast, even though it is not.  “Feeling” 50fps instead of 25fps can be crucial for immersion, especially for sports on TV.\n\nThere are digital filters to do conversion from one to the other.  Conversion from progressive to interlaced is semi-pointless but harmless, and the “better frame rate” feeling will not happen.  Conversion from interlaced to progressive will double the frame rate but each individual frame will be marred by comb-like artifacts, that are sometimes smoothed out by the filter at the expense of sharpness.\n\nUnless there are bandwidth constraints, in 2018, there is no good reason to capture video using interlacing.\n\n"},
{"title":"ELI5: The Invisible Hand in Economics","question_detail":"I have to write a paper on this for my Economics class. I don't really understand it. Can someone explain it in Laymens terms?

{"title":"ELI5: how do transformers work?","question_detail":"","answer":"Ttransformers are very simple in theory. Alternating current (AC, the type of power that is used in your home) when passed through a coil of wire will produce a magnetic field. That same magnetic field, when applied to another coil of wire through an iron core, will produce an electric current in that second wire. \n\nThis is useful because the proportions of the number of turns of wire in the coils defines the change in voltage from the input to the output (primary to secondary) coils. This means that power can be sent at very high voltage and low current in the transmission lines, which is far more efficient than sending it at low voltage and high current which is where you need it in your home.\n\nThe primary voltage (input) divided by the secondary voltage (output) equals the number of turns in the primary coil decided by the number of turns in the secondary coil. Current (amperage) is voltage divided by load, so as the voltage goes up, the current goes down, which is far more efficient for power transmission because it generates less heat. You use from 110 to 220 or so volts in your home, but power transmission lines are often 10,000 to 30,000 volts. "},

{"title":"ELI5: Why is the flame in a cooker so much less bright than in a candle?","question_detail":"And why is it more violet than orange?","answer":"Candlewax consists of molecules made from carbon in the center and hydrogen on the outside. The heat of the flame turns this stuff into a gas, which mixes with air and then slowly burns away. The tip of the flame is the point where the combustion is complete.\n\nWhen this stuff burns, the oxygen burns away hydrogen atoms first, and the carbon atoms second. At some point, there are so few hydrogen atoms left that it can no longer be a gas, and instead becomes a tiny, solid particle. These particles glow because they're hot, just like the filament in a light bulb or embers in a fire, which is where most of the light from the flame comes from. That is why the candle flame transitions from pale blue at the bottom into a more and more intense yellow towards the top.\n\nThe flame of a gas burner is a bit different because gas has much less carbon, so it it produces far fewer glowing solid particles. In addition to that, gas burners usually aim to mix the gas with air much better than a candle flame, speeding up the combustion process - so any glowing soot particles that do form burn up very quickly."},

{"title":"ELI5: why does it take so long to make/change laws?","question_detail":"","answer":"In a government structured like it is in the United States, laws do take quite some time to change. This is because of the number of people involved in the process, and people always make things slow. There are many steps to getting a law put into place or changed, and since many people are involved in each step, each step takes a not insignificant amount of time.\n\nAnd of course, since the people involved often don't agree with each other, some will intentionally try to stop or slow down the process, while others will send the process backwards to make revisions. This isn't actually a bad thing in all cases, it's good to prevent sloppy laws from being rushed through and causing problems. But it can cause a bit of grid lock when people are calling for new legislation, but the ones actually implementing it can't agree on how (or whether or not) to do so.  \nThis is one major disadvantage to our system of government, laws can't change and react very quickly. But it is also a strength, laws can't be slapped into place as overblown reactions, and silly or stupid laws can be filtered out.\n\nNot that it always works out, we have plenty of stupid laws on the books, but we generally consider it to be better than the alternative - putting the law making power into the hands of one (or very few) person that can decide things quickly but has very little oversight."},

People who do a significant amount of barefoot walking or running have wide forefeet, the toes splay out.  Shoes force the toes to be side by side, and eventually reshape the foot so they stay together like that.\n\nPeople who grow up barefoot in developing countries run with a forefoot strike.

{"title":"ELI5: What are the differences between Democritus atoms and Plato's ideas/forms?","question_detail":"\n2. What is the similarity and differences between Descartes dualism with Popper's pluralism?\n","answer":" \n\nOne  general difference is that Plato was exclusively concerned with ethics,  epistemology, religion and moral philosophy. Aristotle, on the other  hand, pursued many natural sciences in addition to ethics, epistemology,  politics and logic.\n\nAlong with this,  Aristotle tends to dwell more exclusively in the realm of rational  analysis. Plato, on the hand, includes in his works not only rational  analysis, but also myth and poetry: an *artist* as well as *philosopher*,  he appeals to the intuition and the imagination as much as to logic.  Hence, Plato has a mystical dimension Aristotle lacks. On virtually  every page of Plato we see how essential piety and holiness are to his  worldview and message."},

The highest speed wind is coming from  your left as you face an approaching storm. The reason is that the  forward motion speed of the storm is added to wind speed there and that  wind is coming at you. The wind to your right is slower by the forward  speed subtracted and that wind is going away from you.\n\nEarly  in the formation of a tornado, the winds just outside of the vortex are  not yet full of debris and dust, so they may appear invisible.

{"title":"Eli5: how can a percentage pass 100%","question_detail":"I’m watching the movie Paddington and the dad is a risk analysis and said “having a bear in the house increases the chances of a natural disaster by 4000%”\n\nAnd my favorite mascara (Better Than Sex) says it “increases your lash volume by 1944%”\n\nWhat does this mean? I always thought 100% was the maximum. I hope my question makes sense.","answer":"To clarify, probability can only fall between 0 and 100%. Otherwise, percentage is basically just an amount relative to another amount which otherwise represents 100%. It's saying original amount x (percent / 100) = new amount. So in your case, let's say the chance of a natural disaster was 2% originally. Increasing it by 4000% means more like being 40 times more likely, so 2 x 40 = 80% chance (and maybe the original 2% so maybe it's 82%, but that's less important). \n\nOr with your other example, increasing your volume by 1944% is more like saying it makes it 19.44 times larger. In this case, it's also important to note that volumes increase exponentially relative to the dimensions. For example, a 2x2x2 cube will have a volume of 8 while a 3x3x3 cube will have a volume of 27, which is over 3 times larger (or 337.5%)  despite only a 50% increase in each dimension. Lashes aren't cubes, they're more like long cones, but basically it'd only take a little more thickness to get a lot more volume.\n\nThese little tricks are used in advertising to present bigger numbers because our brains and basically wired to like the sound of 1944% more volume rather than, say, 3 times thicker."},
{"title":"ELI5: Since objects in motion stay in motion, should a poor person trade their car for some kind of smaller faster flying machine to save on gas and time, if it were legal?

And of course you want redundant safety such as if one of the engines breaks mid flight etc.","answer":"Newtons firs law is not just objects in motion stay in motion is is:\n\n&gt;An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.\n\nWe are on earth that have gravity and air resistance. So a aircraft have to create a force to stay flying. It is done by forcing air down with the wing. That and the drag from the air around to airplane  require a engine else you lose speed. A car stand on the wheel so you have force to counteract gravity so you don not need large wings. You still have air resistance but it is lower because the car is slower. \n\nThe result is that a car is more fuel efficient then a small airplane. \n\nA large airlines can be more fule efficient per person and distance traveled then a car with a single person in them but when you compare to a bus or a train the are less efficient.  Airplane efficiency depend a lot on the distance because you use a lot of energy taking off and climbing to flight altitude so long distance is more efficient."},

Sure, you could buy a domestic food processor for £50 but it wouldn't last a month.  Having said that, it's cheaper to buy £50 versions and throw them away every month than to get one of those!\n\nRobot Coupe is a very expensive make.

{"title":"ELI5: How is sewage turned into tap-water?","question_detail":"","answer":"It usually isn't.  It's normally treated and dumped into rivers.  Water treatment normally begins by filtering out large pieces of debris.  They let the water settle, remove all the sludge and oil that rises to the top.  The water then gets oxygenated by agitation which allows bacteria to break down the remaining waste in the water, it goes into another settling tank and chemcially oxidized (e.g. bleach) and the bleach is removed and the water gets released."},
{"title":"ELI5: What is so terrible about the water boarding torture method? Why does it seem to be the “taboo” torture method?","question_detail":"","answer":"It's not necessarily more taboo. The reason it's talked about is becuase there was some debate about whether or not it's torture. We've basically been saying that we don't torture people, but when it came out that we were waterboarding everyone was kind of asking what happened to the whole no torture thing? The government replied by saying that waterboarding doesnt count. You're not actually hurting them, they're not being beaten or cut or really physically damaged, so it's not 'really' torture. \n\nPeople of course disagreed with this. I've never been waterboarded, but my understanding is when you do it it simulates drowning. It convinces your body that you're going to die and you enter full blown pure just bodily panic mode like flipping a switch. You're not actually being physically hurt per se, but your body doesn't know that and from what I've heard it's essentially the worst feeling you can imagine. So even though some people claim it's not really torture, and so they use it, a lot of people disagree with it's use. "},

{"title":"ELI5: what is structuralism and post-structuralism and how are they different from each other","question_detail":"","answer":" The short answer is that  structuralism looks at the relations or the structure present within  phenomena, while poststructuralism takes into account the actual  relations and structure present within the structuralist approach you  employ to understand something. So it's a kind of meta.  \n\n\nThe long  answer is that philosophers have always been searching for some kind of  core, meaning or answer. \"God\", \"human\", \"being\" etc. Then Heidegger  came along and asked everybody a question: we're always searching for  some kind of core, a center, but what about questioning our very need to  search for the core and the center?

Then there were a few others who  started to question that need to find the answer to everything and  connected it strongly to language, \"the limits of our world\", etc.   \n\n\nLong  story short, gradually people shifted from trying to find the ultimate  answer to studying the actual workings of this search for the ultimate  answer. The structure of our thinking, the relations that define who we  are and what we're thinking, how language (and other mediums we use)  affect us, etc.   \nThat's structuralism more or less. It doesn't  attempt to give the ultimate answer anymore, it just admits that it  proposes a way of looking at things through relations. But then if you  start looking at things in this way you lose some kind of emotional  attachment and poetry. So there was this resurrection of mystical and  poetic in philosophy and let's use Derrida here as the main protagonist,  why not. He was the one to say, ok, let's look at the structure of  things, at all the relations and the dynamics of how things are to  understand better, fine. He even did it himself quite a lot also. But  then what you're left with is a whole disassembled in parts and that's  not good, because it loses life. So to inject life again into the  disassembled whole, we need to assemble it again. But in a way that will  produce something new, like poetry or art.   \n\n\nThis approach was  then further developed (without using the \"poststructuralism\" monicker)  by the likes of Agamben and Meillassoux – speculative realism perhaps  being the latest attempt to do philosophy in a way that has a meaning  but doesn't make logical sense although still provides for a very  inspiring reading.

{"title":"ELI5: What are symbolic links and what's it's significance?","question_detail":"","answer":"On a computer disk, a file is a series of data bytes that contain the information in the file. For example, an MP3 file contains encoded audio that you can play back. Files can be extremely large, and often are. Modern file systems allow files to be arranged into hierarchies, called directories.\n\nSomething else you can have in a disc directory is a symbolic link. This is a data item that, instead of carrying its own information, merely points to another file somewhere else. Computer operations that operate on the link are redirected to the other file. In other words, the link is a name and pointer to a file somewhere else on the disc.  Links themselves are quite small, normally consuming only a few bytes on the disc.\n\nLinks are useful in cases where the same file needs to be accessible from different directories. Rather than making copies of potentially large files, setting up a link means the same file can be shared widely, often under different names. Also, by changing what a link points to it's possible to upgrade files and so on without the user of the file being aware or needing to know about the change.\n \nThere's a saying in software engineering that any problem can be solved by adding a layer of indirection. Links are an example of this."},
{"title":"ELI5: How do people who hear for the first time with cochlear implants understand spoken language?","question_detail":"","answer":"The thing to understand here is that every person's hearing loss or hearing impairment -- and, subsequently, each persons hearing improvement via cochlear implant -- is dependent on a myriad of factors from the cause of their hearing problems, to how long they've been deaf or hard of hearing, to the _type of education_ they've received and whether that education accommodated their disability, etc. Also, remember, a cochlear implant isn't a miracle -- it can't make you go from profoundly deaf to normal hearing, but it might enable you to go from profoundly deaf to being able to hear *something*. \n\nWith all that in mind, your question doesn't make much sense because it's *too broad*. \n\nSomeone who lost their hearing due to disease or injury at, say, age  15 isn't going to have any problem understanding spoken language if they regain some of their hearing via a cochlear implant. A child born profoundly deaf raised in a deaf environment (e.g. a deaf family and attending schools for the deaf) may have never learned vocalizing or lipreading; such a person would be starting from scratch if they received some hearing improvement from an implant. \n\nSo the answer to your question is: they don't; it all depends on the individual's circumstances.

{"title":"ELI5: Why does carbonated drinks fizz more when its warm and less when its cold?","question_detail":"Tried to drink a warm bubbly water and it turned to fluff as soon as I took a sip","answer":"Let's zoom in to picture what carbonated water is at the level of molecules. \n\nThere's a bunch of water molecules (H2O) and a bunch of carbon dioxide molecules (CO2). \n\nWater is a bit sticky. We don't usually think of it like that because it evaporates before it causes trouble but it is. That's why some drops stick to the sides of your glass and to your hands when you wash them. It can stick to gasses too. \n\nIn a cold carbonated drink, H20 molecules are sticking to C02 molecules. But the C02 gas floats  in water so it's trying to rise to the top as sticky H2O clumps to it and slows it down. \n\nPicture the CO2 like a cube with an H2O sticking to each of the 6 sides. If each CO2 molecule is only big enough to get like 6x H2O molecules stick to it at a time, it will rise pretty slowly. It has one CO2 worth of floating force pulling up and 6x H20 worth of drag holding it back. \n\nThe ratio of floating force to drag is 1:6\n\nNow what happens if this CO2 molecule meets another like a pair of dice? Well water is stickier to water than it is to CO2 (it is more *co*hesive than *ad*hesive)—so if the CO2 molecule cubes happen to have a side touching, the water will form a pocket around the CO2 rather than give up it's cohesion to itself. This is a bubble. You've got a tiny bubble. \n\nThis bubble now has 2x float force pulling it up right? But if we count the exposed sides with H2O sticking to it—2 of the sides of the 2 cubes are already touching each other. This set of 2 CO2 molecules only 10x H2O  dragging on it or  5x H2O per molecule. That's one less drag per molecule. \n\nThe ratio of floating force in a tiny bubble is 1:5\n\nYou can see how bigger bubbles get to float faster than smaller ones, right?\n\nSo what does this have to do with temperature? Well how do these CO2 bubbles find one another? If they ever do run into each other by chance, the cohesion of H2O forms a pocket that keeps them together—so any random motion in the molecules makes it more likely for CO2 molecules to run into each other (to form bubbles). \n\nRandom motion in the molecules is called heat. Higher temperature simply means a higher average random motion of the molecules—and a higher chance that CO2 molecules.get together and get sealed in by H2O pockets. \n\nBoom. Fizzy drinks. "},

{"title":"ELI5 why did Saudi Arabia kill the journalist in the consulate? Why not some place less contoverisal?","question_detail":"","answer":"I can think of a few reasons....to start with, it's their embassy and theoretically they've got good control over what goes on inside it.  The police can't just appear and burst in to interfere after all, and no one else can see what's happening.  It's a diplomatic facility, technically outside the jurisdiction of the host country.  Guy goes in, never comes out, the Saudis say \"eh, we have no idea where he went after he left\" and no one else can get the information to prove a thing...at least, that's the _theory_. You can tell because it was their original story. In practice it seems they rather underestimated the ability of Turkey to track the movements of people entering the consulate and even get information from sources inside it. As a result, things didn't work out so well for them.\n\nBut that brings us to my second point: they probably figured they could get away with it anyway.

{"title":"ELI5: Why can we see that a word isn't spelled correctly without knowing the correct spelling of the word","question_detail":"","answer":"Words in alphabet-based languages are ‘built’ using certain rules: there are fixed base letter patterns, and there are fixed rules for adjusting those patterns in certain cases.\n\nAs you become fluent in such a written language, your brain automatically learns to recognise those patterns, without you really noticing.\n\nWhen you encounter a random word, even one which you have never seen before, you use those patterns to try and recognise parts of words you do know within the new word in an attempt to make sense of it, and to figure out what the word would sound like.\n\nIf you come across a word that doesn’t comply to the patterns you’re used to, your brain will get a bit confused, and you’ll recognise the word as being weird, or even misspelled. Since this is based on unconsciously learnt information, it’s highly likely that you won’t be able to pinpoint the actual mistake.\n\nPeople who not only know the patterns and rules not only unconsciously, but consciously as well, should be able to spot the mistake almost immediately, since they know what the brain is looking out for."},
{"title":"ELI5: How is our stomach able to be so loud ?","question_detail":"How can it be that if we are hungry the noise our stomach makes is so loud or on random occasion it starts rumbling and it can be loud  too","answer":"Gasses in your stomach and bowels are moved around making those noises.\n\nWhen you eat, you end up masking those noises with extra mass absorbing those sounds.

{"title":"ELI5: How does traffic engineering work? How are traffic lights timed out to keep everything moving?","question_detail":"","answer":"Alright, there's some great answers here, but they aren't exactly ELI5 level. So here goes my attempt.\n\nLet's imagine that the traffic signal is actually a guy directing traffic. Unfortunately, he's not very smart, so his traffic direction can be a little clunky. \n\nNow, our traffic light guy has a few options. First off, he can rely purely on timing. That means that he has a list of traffic groups, and he just cycles through each group. He lets one set of cars through, and simply counts to a number. Maybe 10 seconds, maybe more, maybe less. Then he switches to the next group on his list. \n \nHis next option is to actually check if there are any cars. This means that he waits until a car reaches the intersection, then changes to let that car through. If the traffic light is smart, it can wait for a certain number of cars, or compare cars in one direction vs the other, or even try to balance things out based on how long a car has been waiting. \n\nFinally, if the traffic light is really feeling like going above and beyond he can talk to the other traffic lights at nearby intersections, and can get ready when they send cars his way. This means that when a car goes through one intersection it probably won't have to wait at the next one, because that light is expecting the car, and has already changed for it. \n\n"},

Like CP or something really bad. If it passes from node to node, aren't all the nodes totally guilty of having that stuff on their computers so they can propagate it through the network?\n\n\nAnd while we're at it - the same question applies to VΡNs ","answer":"https://www.torproject.org/eff/tor-legal-faq.html.en talks about a lot about these things:\n\nOne of their statements is: \"we believe that running a Tor relay — including an exit relay that allows people to anonymously send and receive traffic — is legal under U.S. law.\"\n\nSo the answer to your question of \"why aren't exit and relay nodes liable for all the illegal stuff?\" - The people who understand the law and the various aspects of the Tor model (exit nodes, relay nodes, operators etc) have checked and come to the conclusion that according to their interpretation of the law the various aspects of the Tor model are legal under U.S. law.\n\nNow about the illegal stuff you are talking about: Tor is not made for that, Tor is made for source anonymization of traffic.

All the 1st world countries were using protectionism at the beginning and only later started to allow free market from what I see.

Because if your wages are above what it would cost to get the work done in poor countries, you lose jobs until people in your country are poor too.\n\nAnd then your politicians tell people everything is just peachy, which really pisses them off but there's nothing they can do about it, until finally somebody with orange hair rises to the top by promising to put your country first.\n\nWhich involves building economic tariff walls, and literal brick-and-mortar walls, both of which put you in direct conflict with the greatest wall-building civilization the world has ever known.

She’s in her 20’s and I’m 16. We heart weird noises in the basement. We didn’t know what it could’ve been. We stood in the dining room for a minute, and I decided it was prob nothing, yet I was still a bit spooked. But, I was okay enough to go check and walk down stairs in the basement by myself bc I just wanted it to be the furnace and I just wanted to feel peace. So, I began to creep down, and I didn’t see anything. I calmed down so I walked over to the door, where I was something blocking the door. It was an object I have never seen, and my sister hasn’t recalled.  So, I was like, “hey why did u put this here?” In a joking but almost stupid sense because it’s not he first time they have put something against a door in the basement, but I was the door to the outside, the door to the outside room has a big sliding lock, where the rod was stuck under the door. Anyways, I asked if she did wedge it against the door, obviously expecting a yes. And at first it was a yes, until she realized what I was talking about. She saw it, knew neither me or her put t there. No other person in the house could’ve done this, we know for sure. And we know we did not wedge that.\nSo back to the story\nShe said hey, I didn’t put that there acting, come up here. In a panicked voice\nWe ran upstairs and woke her girlfriend up bc safety in numbers, also this girl is a hardcore strong as bitch, so it seems, and we trust her and we wanted her to be alert also. She continuously told us for hours we were crazy and it fell. (By the way the door latch was perfect. Nothing was messaged with. No one was down there. And then my sister started to calm down and realize everything was okay, because they cleared the whole house.but there is no logical explanation on how that thing got wedged in the door, and I would believe it was ghosts before I believe it fell. Sadly, we were)  in a panic and didn’t get photos. A lot of the night is a blur, I’ve been shaking for house, I finally started to calm a little bit ago tho.. but idk how to get to sleep.

{"title":"ELI5: Why do some liquids/substances \"dry\" your skin, while others \"moisturize\" your skin?","question_detail":"","answer":"Polarity. Lipid solubility. \n\nThings that are non polar and not soluble in water won't absorbed by the skin, so they might make it feel moisturized since they remain on the surface. Motor oil, for example. Or petroleum jelly or any lotion that contains petroleum--jelly doesn't have water in it, so it just sits on your skin. Lotion does, plus alcohol, so there's some evaporation and some penetration into the skin from that. \n\nThings that are highly polar (like water and anything that dissolves in it) and water soluble, go into your skin much more easily, in part because you are water and these things dissolve in water. If you stick your hand in a vat of acetone, we can measure acetone in your exhaled breath almost immediately. \n\nAcids and bases, by definition, are soluble in water. But their polarity can vary, and the more polar the more potentially damaging to you by skin contact. Some can burn the shit out of you and some you put on your salad. As they contact your skin, they start denaturing proteins and causing tissue damage. Acids tend to I guess react away faster and do not penetrate as deeply, so they hurt right away and if you can escape it, you will do so. Bases are more insidious, they penetrate deeper into the skin and you will not feel a burn right away.  The damage is deeper and slower but can be just as bad. \n\nThat's all I got. I think most of it is right. Hopefully someone else will come along and clarify further. I've literally never had a decent chemistry class in my life, I've had to cobble together what I know as I go. \n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: What is the heatdeath of the universe?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"If you take a can of soda out of the fridge and leave it on a table for a while, it will warm up. You didn’t put it near anything really hot, but it still didn’t stay cold because the air in the room is warmer than the air in the fridge. The heat, or energy, in the room moved into the area with very little heat, the cold can. This makes the soda can warmer and the room a little colder, just not enough to feel. \n\nThe 2nd law of thermodynamics says that this will always happen. Energy always flows from a place of high energy to a place of low energy until the amount of energy is equal. Like if you have two containers that hold different amounts of water, and then you connect them, the water will flow from the fuller container to the less full container until the water levels are equal. \n\nRight now the universe is full of pockets of high and low heat, constantly trading energy back and forth. That’s what makes stars burn and planets spin and living things eat food and rain fall from the sky. But if that goes on long enough, everything will balance out. Everything will have exactly the same amount of energy in it as everything else, and it won’t be possible to transfer energy anymore. \n\nAt that point, the universe will be dead. Nothing will happen anymore, ever. Everything will be still and quiet, like a corpse in a coffin. \n\nNow, sweet dreams, young 5-year-old!"},

{"title":"ELI5 why ballpoint pens sometimes refuse to work on a specific area of a sheet of paper","question_detail":"I'm sure you've all experienced it at one point or another: you start writing with a ballpoint pen on a sheet of paper and, suddenly, the pen refuses to work in a specific area. You try writing somewhere else on the sheet and it works perfectly fine.

{"title":"ELI5: Why does visiting an ex's IG profile and seeing how happy they are in their new lives always give a \"sharp\" pain in the chest? Why is the pain notably \"sharp\" despite there's no sharp mechanical instrument involved?","question_detail":"","answer":"The “sharp” pain is a muscle contraction in response to your body producing a little too much adrenaline for your particular comfort level. The adrenaline is produced upon your emotional reaction. Your emotional reaction could be an empathetic response to seeing your ex happy even though you’re not part of that happiness, and that’s pretty cool."},
{"title":"ELI5: How are mountain peaks' heights measured using multiple satellites (GPS)? And before GPS?","question_detail":"Assuming I know basic trigonometry. ","answer":"Before GPS, you would use a sextant or similar angle-measuring device to measure the angle the mountain peak is above horizontal.\n\nThen you would walk a fixed distance away, and repeat to obtain a second angle above horizontal.\n\nUsing some basic trigonometry, you would be able to get a somewhat accurate estimate of the mountain’s height. This method doesn’t account for curvature of the earth, but it’s good enough to estimate the height of a mountain and your distance to it.\n\n\nThe math for those interested:\n\nAssuming the height of mountain is h, and the distance from your original position is x, and you walked 1000m, while the angle changed from 15 to 30 degrees, you can set up the following equations and solve them\n\ntan(15) = h/x\ntan(30) = h/(x+1000)"},

{"title":"ELI5: Why does water taste different at different temperatures?","question_detail":"","answer":"I don’t know enough to understand the biology behind it, but I once read a theory that the reason the body interprets different temperature water in different ways is due to evolution.\n\nThe idea was that cold water was more likely to be ‘fresh’ as it would usually be from a running stream/river, and therefore less likely to contain contaminents. Therefore, it tastes ‘better’ to us as our body encourages us to drink it.\n\nHowever, warm/lukewarm water was more likely to be from a standing body of water, something that is more likely to contain contaminents/parasites/bacteria, and so we evolved for this to be less paletable.\n\nI don’t know if this is true scientifically, but it makes sense to me!\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: How can boats stay afloat with all the weight from metal","question_detail":"","answer":"Buoyancy. Water has a certain density, and anything less dense will float on top. Iron is more dense, but if you distribute that weight over a wide enough surface area, then more water is bearing the weight, to the point the object floats. This is the trick behind displacement. It's weight over surface area, weight over displacement."},
{"title":"ELI5: How come the porcelain part of a spark plug break glass easily?","question_detail":"","answer":"The side windows of cars are made from tempered glass, similar to phone screens. This type of glass is extremely hard to break - there are videos of people trying and failing to break windows with sledgehammers. There's also a video by the YouTuber SmarterEveryDay where he shoots bullets at tempered glass drops, and the only thing that shatters on impact is the bullet.\n\nWhat you need to break a window like that is a huge force contentrated on a small point. But it's enough if that force just lasts for a split second on impact, just enough to start a microscopic crack. This crack will then quickly spread throughout the window and shatter the entire thing. The easiest way to generate such a force is to use a very hard material, harder than regular steel. For example window smashers in buses and trains use a very hard metal spike, something like tungsten carbide. You can also use a centerpunch, which is designed to punch dents into a piece of steel before drilling holes.\n\nThe ceramic material from spark plugs are also extremely hard, which is why they work for breaking windows.

{"title":"ELI5: What are and how effective are sabermetrics, and can they be applied to other sports?","question_detail":"","answer":"Sabermetrics in baseball is a statistical analysis of performance.  The idea is to shift away from aggregate measures like \"hits per at bat\" which have tactical dependencies that consider who's on which base and the overall state of the game.  Instead, statisticians look at measures like OPS+ (runs per out relative to the league average).  This measure can be statistically shown to be a better performance predictor than batting average.\n\nTo apply the concept to other sports you'd need three things: data, more data, and a game model.  Baseball is a slow game, in terms of time between plays to write down data about what just happened.  As a result, baseball statisticians have lots of data for many past years with batter-by-batter detail and recent data with pitch-by-pitch detail.  This would be harder to do in a faster game like basketball or a game with more things going on at the same time (which makes the game model harder to interpret) like soccer or football."},

I'm working on a product that I think could work fairly well and the software/VM guys like it but I don't follow how Virtual Processors speeds can be higher than the physical cores they draw resources from.  \n\n\nMy assumption is that if a task is divided in half and given to 2 cores, it should in theory run twice as fast minus the loss in efficiency stemming from piecing the two halves back together.  \n\n\nI've been out of the datacenter for too long and I'm either missing something or overcomplicating it for myself.  \n\n\nHow fast could I (reliably) bully a bunch of 2Ghz cores into moving on one core and what sort of diminishing returns would I see as I add more physical cores into the mix?  \n\n\nThank you,","answer":"Some tasks can't be divided up at all. You can't get nine women together to have a child in one month, for example.\n\nTasks where each step requires the previous steps can't be sped up by adding multiple cores, because each step still takes the same amount of time. Tasks where each step doesn't depend on previous steps can be nearly doubled by doubling the number of cores. The more independent steps you have, the more benefit you get from adding more cores in.

{"title":"ELI5: How can a space probe like New Horizons capture such clear images of fast moving AND far objects in space while it is moving at such fast speeds itself, when my DSLR/phone camera can't even take photos with a decent amount of clarity with small hand vibrations?","question_detail":"I'm [referring to this](http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/News-Article.php?page=20190124). From my limited understanding of astronomy and aeronautics, I know that because space is almost a vacuum, the motion of both the lenses on the space probe and the asteroid itself is nearly constant, making it easier to do motion-tracking of such fast moving objects in space. \n\nBut in commercial applications like a DSLR and phone camera, they have the economy of scale advantage. Why are the image stabilisation technologies in commercial products so dated? Furthermore, the space probe's image was \"taken when the KBO was 4,200 miles (6,700 kilometers) from the spacecraft\". How backwards  are commercial products when we only have a something like 100x optical zoom among the mass market for prosumers?","answer":"Motion blur is all about angular velocity in relation to the camera. It’s not directly dependent on relative velocity between the camera and the photographed object. A fast car passing you at a distance of 100 m won’t produce any motion blur. It certainly will if it passes you at a distance of 5 m. The translational velocities are the same, but the car will cover a larger angle if it’s closer to you. Even if a space probe passes a moon or planet at 10 km/s, the sheer distance from the object pushes the angular velocity down to very low levels.\n\nAlso, vibrations can be a major problem even in space probes, but usually at a lower threshold. A space probe usually weighs several hundred kilograms, so it’s got much more inertia than your shaky hands. And the probe can be rotated at a constant speed to keep the camera focused on a certain point."},

{"title":"ELI5: How do different wavelengths of radiation have different properties?","question_detail":"I consider myself fairly knowledgeable about certain types of physics for my age but something I just have a hard time researching. How do different wavelengths of radiation have such different properties? \n\nRadio waves can transmit music across a 30 mile radius, microwaves can send phone calls and cook food. How can microwaves cook certain things but not the air, when infrared does and is just a smaller wavelength than microwaves. Infrared is literally just heat, which is practically everywhere and is it’s own form of energy in classic physics. Then visible light is pretty innocuous, even though infrared and microwaves are much more harmful and are larger wavelengths. Ionizing radiation: While ultraviolet is outside of visible light and yet “UV lights” exist. Ultraviolet also causes sunburns. While X-rays can be extremely harmful yet help map out people’s bone structures in small doses. Then gamma rays are really dangerous and can travel halfway across the galaxy in a gamma ray burst, yet I hear people say that radio waves are more effective than microwaves when communicating farther.\n\nMy question is, how does the same particle/wave have so many different properties at different wavelengths? ","answer":"It is all about the energy they carry. Ionizing radiation is bad for us because the energy is enough to strip away electrons and cause an atom to become charged (ionic). Microwaves don't cook the air because they aren't being focused enough. Focus is the key there. It all comes down to how much energy each kind propagates. "},

And by changing the time inbetween those pulses higher and lower tones are generated.  \nBut how does a computer do this when a process can be interrupted at any time? Also how could a gameboy for instance create higher notes when it only had a clockrate of few MHz?","answer":"Compared to a computer, the gameboy had very limited sound capabilities. It had two square wave channels, a noise channel and a wave. It had specialized hardware to create these sounds.\n\nIf the gameboy wanted to play a note. It would set the frequency and envelope (volume) of one of the square wave channels. Since there were only two square wave channels, it could only play two notes at once.\n\nFor sound effects or drums it would use the noise channel.\n\nThe wave channel could play back recored sounds. but it could only hold 32 4-bit samples. This means the sounds were very short and very low resolution. Sounded very bad.\n\nAs consoles improved, they got more advanced sound hardware. But it still operated on the principle that there was a CPU and digital synthesizer hardware, and the CPU would set parameters on the synth to create sound. This was very little work for the CPU, but quite limited in sound. \n\nBy the mid to late 90s, this changed. The synth hardware disappeared as CPUs became fast enough to synthesize the music or just play back recorded music. Video game music lost it's 'sound' and just became music."},

Your AC or heater might keep the air temperature stable, but outside walls are usually warmer or colder than that.

How does my brain chemicals tell my body to feel buzzed like that? ","answer":" \n\nOur society is possibly too gentile, finding reasons for our mental ailments giving them wonderful names, and then allowing the patient to have a reason and “an excuse” for treating himself or herself badly and those around him or her badly because he or she has an “official mental illness”.\n\nSo albeit your diagnosed illness, and the feelings of elation, anxiety and depression, realise that there are those around you who try or have tried to love you but whom you have invariably turned away or you are invariably ratty with or you have invariable made suffer through your mood swings and exaggerations when in manic mode. Together with the meds you will or have already be given, and the analytical support you should receive from your therapist and psychiatrist make the extreme effort to try and objectively understand what is happening to yourself in every mood you might be in and don’t use the illness as a reason or an excuse to either treat yourself or those around you without due respect and consideration.\n\nRemember that your hell, could become purgatory, using the correct meds, therapy and your own intelligence and willpower; do not succumb to “oh, thats the way I am and I won't change anyway, because I am ill”. Purgatory is better than hell and more manageable. When you are in uncontrolled hell, then those close to you are also in hell with you.\n\nI might sound pretty radical with this approach, but I have suffered 21 years of marriage with someone with the same diagnosis, and her illness was always her excuse for the ill treatment I received.

Both guys get in total slightly more than they paid for, and they pay royalties to the first guy. Repeat for each of them.

{"title":"ELI5: why did old games need batteries in the cartridge to save rather than using the consoles power?","question_detail":"","answer":"The old consoles were made to be as cheap as possible so that regular consumers could afford to buy them. And at the time permanent storage were very expensive. The technology behind flash cards and SSDs were not developed yet so the options were either tape or if you could afford it you could buy a hard drive. So the game consoles did not come with any permanent storage. They came with Read Only Memory which were programmed at the factory and Random Access Memory which were wiped every time you turned off the power. So in order to save the game state the cartridges used RAM chips. However they would lose your progress if you switched off your console or ejected the cartridge so they were no good on their own. But the cartridges came with a battery that could supply power to the RAM even when you ejected the cartridge. This was not an issue at the time when the batteries were new but can often cause issues now that the batteries are over 20 years old."},

Who are these actually made for? Are they the fashion equivalent of concept cars, where the designers test something out and then very little of it gets to the consumer? Is it some contest they have with each other? ","answer":"It's important to understand that fashion designers and those that follow high fashion tend to view fashion as an art form.  Like other visual artists, they use shapes and colors to convey messages and emotions.   \n\nBig fashion shows basically allow designers to push the limits of their artform without having to be bound to things like practicality or commercial feasibility.  They're often trying to be intentionally evocative with their runway shows.  \n\n&gt; Are they the fashion equivalent of concept cars, where the designers test something out and then very little of it gets to the consumer?\n\nThat's actually a very good analogy.  \n\nTo use your giant donut example, they may be sending someone out wearing a giant donut looking outfit as a way to show that they're going to incorporate circular patterns or shapes into their commercial products.  The giant donut could be an over the top display of a much more grounded design idea.  \n\nThis is similar to how concept cars may have over exaggerated contour lines or some outlandish feature.  Maybe that idea will never make it into a real product, but it signals that they're looking to innovate in a certain area.  \n\n&gt; Who are these actually made for?\n\nGenerally, people who like fashion.  It's like asking who giant, abstract statues are made for.  \n\nThere is also sometimes a commercial angle, in that they're trying to sell their brand and style to potential product buyers.  "},

{"title":"ELI5: How do seeds work in PC games?","question_detail":"I've been seeing a lot of random world type games like Minecraft or RimWorld.  I've just been puzzled by how these things work, and how you can affect them.  Minecraft uses a number system, while RimWorld uses full words (Like the passwords in Fallout 3/NV) I've played around with the word ones, but IDK if they'll accept anything, or if it just chooses a random default.","answer":"Former game developer here,\n\nSo you're talking about random number generators. There are two types - true random, and pseudo-random.\n\nTrue random uses hardware to generate numbers. The most common type is a noisy diode. A diode is a semiconductor component that allows current to flow one direction, but not the other. They can screw with these things where it kinda doesn't want to flow in the forward direction, either. Instead, you get random jolts forward, like a jittery short circuit. You can use this to your advantage - if you *sample* the circuit, like you sample audio, you take a measurement off the wire at a given frequency, and you'll find that it's either carrying a current, or it's not. And you can use that for your bits! Random binary digits! The drawback is that these are speed limited, and being truly random, you can't reproduce the random number sequence it makes, which is sometimes, and in our case, a useful property.\n\nA pseudo-random number generator uses an algorithm that is a number of mathematical operations that aren't reversible, they also happen to produce number sequences you can't predict without calculating the sequence. The repeatability is useful for crypto and video games. Why do I have to store all this game world data when I only need to store a single value and I can generate the whole sequence from there?\n\nSo if you're going to generate pseudo-random numbers, you need to start with a number. That's the seed. You can just pick something, like 7, or you can try to get something kinda random-ish to start. Whatever number you pick, so long as you use the same algorithm, you'll always get the same sequence. So how do you pick a starting seed? Typically, we use time. Time on your computer is stored as a large integer, and it's always marching forward, so your seed is always going to be unique from one starting seed to the next. Time itself, by the way, makes a very poor random number because you know each time you look at it, the number only ever gets bigger, and it's very predictable.\n\nNow what do we do with random numbers? This gets a bit technical, but we use a technique called procedural generation. This is where content isn't created by people, but by programs. The best example I can think of is if you've ever played Dungeons and Dragons. The game has lots of tables for all sorts of stuff, and you can use dice to roll a random row on that table. Hm, what sort of monster should I attack you with? :Rolls dice: 37. What's row 37? Ah, Ancient Red Dragon. That's how the game world is produced. It gets more elaborate than that, of course, but it comes down to stuff like that.\n\nAnd so long as I know what seed you started with, I can use that sequence to produce the same procedures in the same order to produce the same content every time. So all the details of the game world don't need to be stored. If anything, the game can produce your game world, and it only needs to store the difference from the generated content to how it's been changed through gameplay, which is typically a lot less information than, say, the properties of every single block in Minecraft."},

I know most homes only have one water tank so how do the sinks/showers actually work ","answer":"Cold water flows into your house from outside (well or water supply).  At some point in your house is a water heater that cold water goes in and hot comes out.  So the original input to your house is split, one side stays cold and one side goes to the heater.  At this point you now have two \"sources\", one hot (out from the heater) and one cold (from the original input).\n\nSome sinks have two faucets, one for hot and one for cold.  Some sinks have a single faucet.  The single faucet has two inputs (hot and cold) and one output.  Depending on how you set the single faucet you may get just cold water, just hot water, OR a blend of both hot and cold.\n\nSo if you think of the single faucet as a knob you turn, think all the way to the right as just cold and all the way to the left as just hot.  Turning it \"somewhere in the middle\" mixes the two.  All the way to the right gets you cold water, mostly to the right gets you cool water, the middle warm, mostly to the left REALLY warm, and all the way to the left gets you hot water.\n\nThat help?

{"title":"ELI5: How much difference in biology makes it a different species?","question_detail":"For example, if future archaeologists found my skeleton (I am a short, Indian , female) and they found Michael Phelps' skeleton, how will they know whether they have found 2 different species , or just two skeletons from the same species that are very different from each other? Since no skeleton is exactly the same , I am confused as to how archaeologists know they have discovered a new species. \nHow much difference in what they find makes it a new species ? \nSorry if this is hard to understand !","answer":"The notion of distinct species is a human-made concept to help us make sense of all the past and present life we observe.  In other words, there’s nothing inherent in life that yields this framework.  I’ve always understood “of the same species” to mean there’s scientific consensus that two individuals are alike “enough” to be grouped into a single category.  My two cents."},

One nonspecific, one specific. Essentially all viral infections elicit the same core symptoms from the nonspecific response.

{"title":"ELI5:What gives someone the sound of their voice? Why have I never met someone who sounds like a person I know?","question_detail":"","answer":"The \"sound\" of your voice is determined by a combination of things, mainly the vocal cords and larynx (voice box). Historically men have thicker and longer vocal cords than women which is why they, men, have lower voices. Think of it like a bass guitar versus a lead guitar, or for the classical buffs cello versus violin. \n\nNow when you take the vocal cords and voice box and combine them with your throat, nasal cavity, and mouth, which all act as a resonating chamber the result in your \"voice\". \n\nNow if you've ever met twins you might have had a difficult time telling them apart, that's because the size and proportions of these things are quite similar if not equal. \n\nIf you then take this one step further, think about how many times you looked at someone and thought they looked just like someone else you know (doppelgänger), comparatively you probably see more people than you really listen to. Obviously there are exceptions to this rule, but oftentimes we have other triggers that tell us the person we are talking to isn't someone we've met before."},

{"title":"ELI5: How integrals can calculate areas?","question_detail":"im new here so im sorry if this doesnt belong here, but this question is driving me crazy all the explanations i could find are pretty complex, im suppoused to imagine an infinite amount of squares or something like that? but than, how could it ever be accurate?\n","answer":"There isn't an easy way to ELI5 this topic because the fundamental concept of calculus (integrals and derivatives) is dependent on a solid understanding of the mathematical concept of \"Limits\".\n\nA limit is when you determine what value a function is approaching at a given independent variable without actually entering the independent variable into the function.\n\nThis is primarily in order to deal with sections of functions that would divide/multiply by zero at that independent variable and determining the value of the function at Infinity.\n\nThis is necessary for understanding how integrals work because the the root concept is that the more sections you can cut the function into, and summing the parts that each have an area of (x2-x1) × y, the *closer* you get to the actual value, but as long as the \"reslution\" of the (x2-x1) calculation is coarser than infinite, you will never have the mathematically accurate value. \n\nIf you have infinite resolution, then x2 = x1. Therefore the area of that slice is calculated as 0 × y, which is always 0 for all values of y.\n\nTherefore, we don't actually try to sum the area of an infinite number of 0 area slices (for two obvious reasons), but rather, we calculate the \"limit\" that the coarse function approaches as the difference of x2 and x1 approaches 0 to the same value."},
{"title":"ELI5: What's the problem with curing cancer?","question_detail":"","answer":"Cancer is effectively cell-division gone crazy.  There are so many different ways for that to occur -- radiation, chemical exposure, and genetic factors are common causes.  \n\n\nThe primary reason cancer is so hard to treat is because each person's cancer has a unique pattern of genetic changes, but those changes are not always consistent in an individual: as a cancer spreads, more and more changes occur, and even in the same tumor the cancerous cells may have different genetic changes.  Thanks to those variations, no single treatment method is effective against all types of cancer, so while chemotherapy (for example) may knock down *most* of the cancerous cells, it won't necessarily get *all* of them*.*  \n\n\nAlso, as others have pointed out, many cancer treatments are often more damaging than the disease itself, so many patients choose to employ less-effective (but safer) treatments until the concern over causing further damage becomes irrelevant."},

{"title":"ELI5: How does a “high metabolism” work?","question_detail":"","answer":"It's mostly a myth.\n\nChildren - especially young children and teenage boys - tend to have a 'high metabolism' because they're consuming so much energy in growing.\n\nHaving a lot of weight - especially when it's muscle mass - creates a 'high metabolism' because you need to consume a lot of energy to feed those muscles. Living in colder climates also tends to predispose you to burning more calories because of how your fat gets structured.\n\nSome people are also inherently more active than others in non-obvious ways. Where one person might just be a lump on the couch, another person with seemingly the same lifestyle is actually active while being a 'lump on the couch' (jumping up to do something every now and then, constantly fiddling with things, etc.)\n\nYou can also increase your calorie consumption via exercise, but this is far less important than people tend to believe. It's nearly impossible to outrun calorie consumption with aerobic exercise unless that's all you do with your day - the main weight loss virtue of exercise is actually weight training (for the reason mentioned above)."},

Most solar systems sit within the thickness of the record and for this example let’s imagine that they all sit within the grooves of the record (the solar systems sit somewhere within the ridges of the grooves but there’s relatively little height differences between individual solar systems). Our solar system is located near the outer edge of the record, so there’s really no way for our satellites and telescopes can see what’s going on in the center of the record because there are billions of other solar systems sitting between us and the center of the galaxy. \n\nLet’s imagine other nearby galaxies as other records.  A few of these records are more or less facing us in a way that we can see the whole face of the record, from edge to center. It’s much easier to focus our telescopes on the center of those galaxies because there’s very few planets, asteroids, dust clouds, and general space stuff between us and those far away galaxies.

{"title":"ELI5: What is rotational mass? How is it different from normal mass?","question_detail":"","answer":"Regular mass is basically just how much of something there is. Lots of electrons, protons, and neutrons mean lots of mass. \n\nRotational mass depends not only on how much of something there is but also how far that stuff is away from an axis of rotation. \n\nMany people know that force equals mass times acceleration and momentum equals mass times velocity.\n\nIn exactly the same way, rotational force equals rotational mass times rotational acceleration, and rotational momentum equals rotational mass times rotational velocity. \n\nPicture figure skaters. When they spin with their arms outstretched (far from the axis of rotation, large rotational mass) they spin slowly. When they draw their arms in, they reduce their rotational mass; resulting in an increase in rotational velocity. \n\nFor no particular reason, in physics: \n rotational force is usually called “torque” \n rotational mass is usually called “moment of inertia” \n rotational momentum is usually called angular momentum \n rotational velocity is usually called angular velocity\n\nSo in the rotational world’s naming convention, torque equals moment of inertia times rotational acceleration, and angular momentum equals moment of inertia times angular velocity."},

{"title":"ELI5: How does a processor work with just electrical currents?","question_detail":"","answer":"So imagine you have a switch. You flip it, current goes through. Flip it again, no current.\n\nThing is, you have to flip it. But there's another solution: the transistor. It's like a switch, but electronic - it has three pins, basically in, out and switch (base, emitter and collector are the actual terms, but we'll stick with simpler terms). Put a current on the switch, and the current will flow from in to out. No current on the switch means no current between in and out (some transistors work the other way around, ignore that for now).\n\nNow, the thing is, the transistor doesn't particularly care where that current on the switch pin comes from - it can come from another transistor too! So you can put a few of them together and do cool stuff. For instance, you can make what's called logic gates! They take two inputs, and have an output depending on whether there's a current in the inputs or not. An AND gate will only output a current with a current on both inputs, an XOR (exclusive or) gate will only output a current when one of the two inputs has a current on it but not the other, and there's a bunch of others. Like the NAND (not-and) gate, which requires only two transistors, and will always output a current *unless* both inputs have a current on them. \n\nSee how we went from simple switches to more complicated logic? You can combine these into a lot more complex stuff! For instance you can build a simple one-bit memory out of two NAND (not-and) gates - when put together in just the right way you can have what's called an *RS latch*. It has two inputs, *set* and *reset*, and it keeps outputting either a current (1) or no current (0) depending on which input last had a current on it, even if both inputs now have no current on them.\n\nAdd two more NAND gates to that system in the right configuration, and you have a third input to enable the whole system - no input on that third pin means you can send *any* signal to the set and reset pins, and nothing will happen - the latch will only change its output if that third pin has a current on it!\n\nNow, this is all a far cry from a processor, but with just 8 transistors we went from a simple yes/no circuit to a sort of simple memory that can be enabled and disabled as we please! It's not hard to imagine that with millions of transistors we can build *incredibly* complicated logic, and that's exactly how processors are structures. Yes, the individual components are just simple yes/no switches, but they're put together in *just* the right way (and they're insanely tiny!), so you get something that can do a lot of calculations really really fast."},
{"title":"ELI5: How come most of the time we do things like blink and breathe subconsciously but we can also control them consciously?","question_detail":"","answer":"This is because of different muscles doing different things. In the case of breathing when we subconsciously do it muscles like the diaphragm are innervated passively by the brain. But when we consciously breath we don't innervate the diaphragm we innervate muscles of the rib cage and thus we still breath but because of a different reason."},
{"title":"ELI5: How do PIDs work?","question_detail":"","answer":"Imagine you have one of those doors that can swing open to both sides, and you want to make a mechanism that closes it.  You can add a spring between the door and the frame, which will apply a force to the door proportional to the difference between the current position of the door and the closed position, which we call the ‘P’ action since it is proportional. Now the door closes, but it doesn’t stop at the closed position, it swings open to the other side, and back again. We want the door to stop moving. This can be achieved by adding a damper, which applies a force on the door proportional to the velocity of the door, which is the derivative of the position, which is why we call this ‘D’ action. We now have a PD-comtroller, which closes the door and stops it from moving. Now imagine the frame of the door was placed on a slope, and has a tendency to open a bit to one side due to gravity. If we want the door to fully close, we will have to use ‘I’ action, which stands for integral. You can best imagine this as a sensor that measures the distance between the door and the closed position, which sends this information to a small computer that integrates it over time, which in turn drives a motor that applies a force to the door. The integral part here basically means that if there is a gap between the door and the closed position, the motor will apply a force to the door which increases over time until the gap is closed.\n\nCombine both a ‘P’ , ‘I’  and ‘D’ action and you have a PID-controller."},
