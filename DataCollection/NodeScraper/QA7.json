{"title":"ELI5: Horseshoes","question_detail":"What specific benefits do they give?\n\nHow did horses survive successfully without them?\n\nWhy doesn't driving nails into the horse's hoof cause problems?\n\nWhat else can you tell me about horseshoes?","answer":"Horseshoes reduce the wear on the hoof due to hard surfaces like paved roads.  It can also correct for poor hoof strength that can arise from selective breeding.\n\nWild horses walked on softer ground, and weren't worked as hard as domestic horses.  Also, if a wild horse was born with inferior hoofs, would likely get injured an die, so sometimes, they didn't survive.  A domestic horse with similar hoofs can survive and be productive with horseshoes.\n\nIf it is done right, it should cause a problem.  Hoofs are not living flesh, and are similar to your fingernails.  However, it is possible to make a mistake, like having the nail reach live flesh (the quick)...this is painful to the horse, and can lead to serious problems."},
{"title":"Someone gave me this link and said there is no global warming, only climate change. Can you explain this website to me?","question_detail":"http://www.pewclimate.org/facts-figures","answer":"I don't understand why they'd give you this link and then say there's no global warming.  The link is full of evidence of global warming in the last few decades.\n\nAnyway, climate change is just another name for global warming.  The name was changed because it's instinctively difficult to accept that there's global warming when winters actually get worse.  This is because global warming doesn't mean everything is warming up, it means that *on average* the earth is warming up.  Depending on the situation, global warming can create colder local weathers.  For example melting ice changes the amount of salt in the oceans, which  can mess with warm ocean currents.\n\nThe scientific consensus is that it is established that the planet is warming up.  That's just factual evidence.  It is also commonly accepted that human industrialization is at least partly responsible for such an unnatural, fast warming rate."},

{"title":"ELI5: L'Hopital's Rule: How and why does it work?","answer":"It kinda gives you a way to deal with limits which result in indeterminate forms by looking at their derivatives....\n\nSo to help explain it ill start by defining stuff, firstly what a limit is.  A limit is a mathematical concept of the value something will be at as a function or sequence or algorithm approaches a certain initial condition, input value, etc.  So its like, f(x)=y is some function, a limit describes the trend the value of y has as x approaches a certain value, which is defined by the limit of f(x).  This is useful for values that get really really really close but never get to a certain value, or values that are undefined at certain values of x.  (If you need any of these terms defined, please say so, because I realize a 5 year old wont know some of these)\n\nA derivative is a mathematical observation of a function, it deals with how the outputs change as the inputs change.  So while a limit looks at some value on the horizon, the derivative looks at describing how the 'next' value will look.  (not exactly true, but probably enough for this context).\n\nAn indeterminate form is an algebraic expression that includes an infinity, basically.  Normally it includes stuff like infinity minus infinity, or infinity divided by zero or something, its a values that doesnt really make any sense.  They normally are the result of taking a limit of something.\n\nNow the L'HÃ´pital's rule lets you figure out how to solve the indeterminate form by looking at the functions derivatives and comparing them instead of comparing the functions themselves....\n\nI hope this helps"},

They had a 1KW CO2 laser which could cut a 2X4 in half, and also a 200W pulse laser which could make these loud explosions in the air.  No target, just the light itself ionizes the air at the focal spot.  Makes a blue-white dot, and a sound like a small firecracker.  I think they used focusing mirrors, since lenses tend to shatter.\n\nTo draw that sphere shown in the video, how do they change the focal length so fast?  I have no idea.  It's easy to use rotary mirrors to sweep a beam fast side-side or up-down.  But how do they move it in and out for 3D????\n\nHere are some older videos and articles:\n\n[Laser focus breakdown: circles, spirals, butterflies (2006)](http://www.aist.go.jp/aist_e/latest_research/2006/20060210/20060210.html)\n\n[Animated circle w/air breakdowns, 2006 Siggraph youtube.com/watch?v=ZeqIZyUMDP4](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeqIZyUMDP4)\n\n[Air breakdown at beam focus, 0.2joule IR laser pulses youtube.com/watch?v=1HHJhpStza0](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HHJhpStza0)\n\n[CO2 pulse laser, air breakdown 1.0joule youtube.com/watch?v=6N-mz0krcmk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N-mz0krcmk)\n\n[ 100 gigawatt air breakdown youtube.com/watch?v=jBjqT3AQkH0](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBjqT3AQkH0)\n\nSo it's not really a hologram.

{"title":"ELI5: Why are objects transparent or translucent?","question_detail":"I'm embarrassed to ask, and it seems like such an easy thing to answer, so I'm asking here.\n\nI understand that, put simply, objects absorb some colors, reflecting the rest. So if it absorbs all, it appears black. If it absorbs none, it appears white. If it absorbs all but blue, it appears blue.\n\nBut why do some things let light go straight through, like glass? As far as I can tell, it can't be that it's not dense enough to make an effect--there are less dense objects that absorb and reflect.\n\nThanks in advance.","answer":"This is a complicated subject that requires a knowledge of quantum mechanics to fully understand.  So I'm going to speak in generalities that will make sense to a layperson, but won't be completely correct for a physics student. \n\nMaterials are made out of atoms.  Atoms have two characteristics that are especially important for understanding light transmission.\n\n* A cloud of electrons in very specific energy levels.\n\n* Bonds to other atoms, same as you learned in basic chemistry.\n\nWhether a material absorbs or transmits light is determined by these things.\n\nFirst, let's talk about electron energy levels.  Picture this as a bunch of tennis balls sitting on a flight of stairs.  The electrons are the tennis balls, and their energy levels are the stairs.  A few simple rules apply.  You can only have one tennis ball on each stair, and obviously the tennis balls can't be between stairs, they have to be ON the stairs.  \n\nAll light has specific frequencies.  And each stair requires a specific frequency of light to move its tennis ball to the next higher stair.  So to move a ball from the 9th stair to the 10th stair, you might need blue light.  The 3rd stair to the 4th stair might need red light.  So when the light comes in of the right frequency, and there is a tennis ball in the right place, it'll **absorb** the light, and bump the electron up to the next stair.  If this doesn't happen, the light goes right through (transparency).\n\nBut wait, remember our simple rules.  Even if the red light comes in, and you have a tennis ball on the 3rd stair, you can only have one tennis ball on the 4th stair.  So in this case, even if the light were able to bump up the tennis ball, it can't if one's already there.  \n\nIf this sounds all very complex and arbitrary, it is.  That's part of the weirdness of quantum physics.  \n\nNext, let's talk about bonds to other atoms.  The electron model I discussed above is responsible for some sorts of opacity/transparency.  However, opacity/transparency is also caused in other ways: by the molecular bonds absorbing the light.  If the right frequency of light comes in, the bond can actually absorb the light, and convert its energy into heat.  The wrong frequencies will pass right through (transparency).  It's kind of like blowing across the top of a beer bottle: blow the wrong way, and nothing happens.  Blow in the right way, and you get a loud hum.\n\nAnother thing to note is that this applies to *all* electromagnetic radiation, not just visible light.  Things that are transparent to visible light, may be opaque to ultraviolet light or radio waves.  Things transparent to microwaves may be opaque to visible light.  It all depends on the electron configuration, and the chemical bond structure."},

{"title":"ELIF: If I tilt my head left and right, why do I still perceive the world upright?","answer":"Because you don't perceive the world as right side up in the first place.\n\nThe lens of your eye inverts the image that hits your retina, so if you look at a person standing in front of you, their feet at at the top part of your retina and their head is at the bottom.  \n\nThe Brain automatically corrects this.  In fact they put goggles on people that inverted the light before it reached their eyes, and for  a few days they saw the world upside done, but after that the brain corrected it and they saw right side up.

Not 1 and 2 like in the title.","answer":"First, 20 decibels is 10 times as loud as 10 decibels, not the way you put it.\n\nThe reason is, because that is the way the unit is defined.  The unit was developed by the phone company and corresponded to how many miles a signal could travel through cable and still be heard.  The relationship between the distance and energy level turned out to be logarithmic.\n\nI could create a different unit, the *loudie*, that was defined non-logarithmically, and based strictly on the energy level of the signal.

","answer":"[For details...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_gap)\n\nIn many materials, if an electron gains enough energy, is will be free to move around within the metal. It has been \"pushed\" hard enough to get far enough away from the protons in the nuclei so that it isn't stuck close to them anymore. Electrons with that much energy are said to be in the *conduction band*. Electrons that are close to the nuclei, but still able to interact in chemical bonds, are called *valence electrons*, and they are part of the *valence band*. The *band gap* is the energy difference between these two bands.\n\nIn a conductor, the bands overlap so that it almost doesn't take anything to get an electron to move around.\n\nIn an insulator, the band gap is wide, so that it takes a lot of energy to get an electron to jump into the conduction band.\n\nIn a semiconductor, the band gap is small. By modifying the temperature  or applying a voltage, you can shrink the band gap to make the material more conducting or more insulating. (Transistors do this.) If a photon comes by and hits an electron, the electron can jump up into the conduction band if the band gap is small enough and the photon energy is just right. (Solar cells do this.)"},

It has two electrodes in a tube of gas. When ionizing radiation passes through, it turns the gas into a conductor and a spark jumps across the electrodes.

{"title":"what is the internet backbone?","question_detail":"I know what the internet is, how it works and everything. It's a basically a giant network of connected computers that can talk to each other with different protocols. But is the actual backbone of the internet? how does it work? does any one own it? who gets to decided which protocols are used?","answer":"The Internet backbone is a network just like any other, except it uses quite a bit different hardware to facilitate communication.\n\nBasically, it breaks down to some massive switches and routers and some very very wide tubes. \n\n-----\n\nOkay, say you're sending some information to a computer in Europe (whereas you're located in the US). First, the information gets split up into little pieces called packets, and encapsulated on the software level. Your program encapsulates the data, then the network stack further encapsulates the data, then its passed to the hardware which adds its own encapsulation. This is to enable each of these layers to figure out where your information needs to go.\n\nSo now you have this, for the sake of discussion, single packet. This packet was generated on your computer. Your computer sends it down the network connection to your router. Now, your router is likely connected to your modem which is connected to a big switch on your ISP's side. Lets say your ISP is a smaller more local one. They have hardware in your city, but nowhere else. So, now your packet is on your ISPs network. They do some stuff to it and figure out where they have to further send it. They send it along to *their* ISP, a big statewide company that has infrastructure all over the state. This statewide ISP takes data from all of the smaller ISPs onto its own network and then sends it along to the national ISP. This ISP has infrastructure all over the country. It is to the statewide ISPs as the statewide ISP is to all the city ISPs. \n\nThese big national ISPs form the 'backbone'. They have the infrastructure, such as very powerful routers, switches and enough cabling to handle very large amounts of data. Whereas your connection to your ISP might be in the 10mbit range, the backbones are running at speeds of Gigabits, if not Terabits per second. Each higher level aggregates more and more of the smaller ones until eventually all of the internet traffic is passing over just a few very big cables.\n\nYour packet now gets sent along this massive cable, down under the ocean until it reaches the national ISP on the other side. From here on, its the same process as above but in reverse. \n\nFor ownership -- no one really owns it, or at least is not supposed to be able to. And in reality, it is unlikely that any one entity could take the internet down entirely, though severe damage is very very possible. About the worst that could happen is one of the backbone providers shutting down their network. Something like that could effectively sever two halves of the globe from each other on the Internet. Its in everyones best interest to conform to these protocol specifications. \n\nAs for protocols -- essentially anyone can create a protocol. The major ones, like HTTP, FTP, TCP, IP, ARP...etc are all specified by various regulatory bodies. They specify what exactly the protocol needs to be able to do to be conforming to the specs. No one *has* to conform to these, but the result of not doing so will likely mean that *you* wont be able to connect to the internet, or communicate with others using it. "},
{"title":"What was the real cultural and artistic significance of Nirvana?","answer":"They were considered to be the first widely successful 'alternate rock' band, popularized grunge, and legitimized the commercial potential of similar music in the eyes of record producers.

{"title":"ELI5: Reign of Terror 1793-1794","answer":"Okey Dokey. Here is simplified version.\nSo, the french people overthrew their monarchy, chopping off heads, eating baguettes (read: not cake) and having a grand old time. The French then founded the \"Committee of Public Safety,\" which was meant to stabilize France so everyone could go back to having a grand old French time complaining about everything. (remember: French)\nBut, the committee went wild. They not only had nobility beheaded, but their servants, and anyone who was in any way opposed to the Revolution. This committee was headed by a guy names \"Maimilien Robespierre,\" who began to get a big head about everything, eventually creating a 10 day week, and treating himself as a god. When everyone finally wised up, he tried to shoot himself. The gun misfired, broke his jaw, got beheaded. The End."},
{"title":"ELI5 the British Monarchy","question_detail":"Kings, queens, princes, all that good stuff.","answer":"The LY5 explanation is that there isn't much to explain. The monarch is the 'head of state', which means they are in charge of the country. Their children are princes and princesses. When the monarch dies, their oldest son becomes king, or oldest daughter if there are no sons (they become queen not king obviously). This is how many countries have been run for thousands of years. It's generally agreed to be pretty unfair, since the people don't get to choose who is in charge of their country.\n\nThe UK is a little different here in that it is a 'constitutional monarchy'. The details of that are a little complex (and I don't know them) but the basic idea is that the monarch is still technically in charge, but they don't use their power themselves, they delegate running the country to a group of people (in this case parliament) who are (largely) elected by the public. So really the country works like a democracy, and the monarch just dances with foreign presidents, makes speeches at christmas and just generally classes up the place. And as long as the monarch sticks to that sort of thing I think it works remarkably well."},

Okay.\n\n+ The people who make computer peripherals never made a Ray Tracing accelerator card. \n+ But it seems like we are all fiending for a PCI-E card that plugs in a slot and speeds up ray-tracing.

{"title":"ELI5: How does Audiosurf work?","question_detail":"I guess it is some Math-Algorythom, yet tell me how!","answer":"I'm not familiar with how in particular they handle it, but I know a bit about audio. It seems that the placement of blocks is determined by the dynamics of the piece (The changes in volume). \n\nAs many people are quick to point out, modern music typically has very little dynamic range overall, so they could also analyze different parts of the frequency spectrum. For instance, if there's little activity below 100Hz, and then that area suddenly becomes very loud, that's likely the kick drum coming in. I would assume kick and bass are what they base most of the block placements on, maybe also the dynamics of the 1-3kHz range where vocals usually reside."},
{"title":"ELI5 - Gold Bullion and how it is used to create money. ","answer":"Once upon a time, all money consisted of coins made of precious metals with the seal of the king (or whatever sovereign) on them. Their value was the value of the metal, and the seal of the sovereign was the guarantee that the metal was pure and its weight was exact. At least in theory.... in fact, the metal wasn't always pure, and the weights weren't always so exact. This was called \"debasing the currency\".\n\nPaper money was invented. A paper \"bill\" is essentially a certificate. Old US dollar bills used to have wording on them that said, \"the bearer is entitled to X amount of silver or gold from the US Treasury\". The Treasury kept the actual gold in a vault (i.e. Fort Knox), and the paper circulated as a bunch of claims on that gold.\n\nEventually, that was changed so that the bills are now issued by the Federal Reserve, and they are no longer a promise for anything - their worth is whatever you're willing to give or take in exchange for them. They can print as many as they want, since there is no promise they'll be redeemed for anything else in return. This is called \"fiat\" or \"floating\" currency. \n\nNowadays, the Federal Reserve holds other countries' currencies in reserve, and so the value of their notes are tied to the value of the other notes they hold."},

I think I would need a loan to start off, but I don't know where is the best to get one ex big banks, trust groups stuff. I need some basic business knowledge here.","answer":"First, you need to register as a business (varies depending on where you live), then you need a business plan. A detailed one that shows that you've identified your competitors and your target market. One that shows you've calculated all your costs (overhead, supplies, etc) and set a reasonable price point. You need to show that you have a plan for being cashflow-positive within 12 months (generally speaking). If you've got all that done, then you may be able to get a loan. The odds of you getting a loan may improve if you can get friends and family to invest too.\n\nYou may not need a loan, though: for example, if you're running your own business where you offer a service (web designer, construction, etc.) and want a loan to expand or whatever, then it may be enough to open up a business chequing account, spend a couple months establishing that you have cashflow (i.e. you're getting cheques and cashing them into that account), then you can apply for a line of credit through the business.\n\nAll that being said, I bet you can find people in your area (including your local bank or credit union, as well as entrepreneurs' clubs and things like that) who are willing to help you get started with the basics. Your local community college or community center might even have a \"starting your own business\" course that you can take."},
{"title":"ELI5: The Big Bang","question_detail":"As someone uncertain about religion, I have trouble with the concept of everything just coming into existence from nothing. Please explain. Thanks!","answer":"\"Everything just coming into existence from nothing\" has nothing to do with the Big Bang. Here's why.\n\nFirst, we're going to start by assuming what's called the cosmological principle: that we're not anywhere special in the universe, and also that there's no special place in the universe. What this means is that no matter where you are, if you look at big enough clumps of stuff, where by big you should think of at least the size of galaxy clusters, the universe pretty much looks the same everywhere. Now for smaller clumps this isn't true, of course - there's the Milky Way, then a bunch of empty space, then Andromeda, etc. But the details don't make enough difference to change anything that I'm about to talk about. And this idea has worked really well so far, so we trust it.\n\nWhat happens when you solve the equations of general relativity under these assumptions is this: you find that as time progresses, distances between objects change. This isn't from things moving - space itself \"stretches.\" And importantly, there's just one number, called the scale factor, which tells you how much space stretches.\n\nNow when we look at the sky with very powerful telescopes, we can, with very clever methods (ask if you want more) figure out how the universe stretched over time, meaning how the scale factor changed with time. From this, we can use general relativity to work backwards in time. What we find is that general relativity predicts that there was a time when space was so contracted that the distance between objects was zero. This means that everything in the universe was packed into an infinitely tiny pellet.\n\nThe problem is that we actually can't trust general relativity all the way back to that point because other physics that we don't understand yet is important. But we are quite sure that we can trust it back to a point about a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second after the time that we're supposed to get zero size. That's not long - by comparison we're 13.7 billion years after the time when we're supposed to get zero size. This means that the universe had a huge, huge, huge amount of stuff packed into a tiny, tiny, tiny volume. From this, the universe expanded into what eventually became today's universe. This expansion is the Big Bang.\n\nNow what about before this ridiculously early time? Where did that pellet come from? We don't know yet. Until we put quantum mechanics and gravity together, we can't really predict anything and have any reason to think it's right. So yes, we still don't know why there was any stuff to expand in the first place, but that has nothing to do with the Big Bang.\n\nPlease ask if you have questions or want more details on any of the things I've talked about.\n\nEDIT: Oops, one too many trillionths."},

Or is it a random chance that can happen in any generation?","answer":"I'm guessing you've heard about \"prison-rape\". It's not about attraction to other guys, but to show dominance over them.

I'd like a technical answer without childish analogies.  If there's jargon I don't understand, I can ask again in a comment.**\n\nPlease explain the fundamental differences between the UNIX based OSes (OSX, Linux etc) and DOS/Windows, including the advantages one has over the other (ie. why UNIX is universally used in servers and why Windows has massive consumer market share).","answer":"Honestly, asking for the \"fundamental differences\" between UNIX-based OSes and Windows NT-based OSes is a bit like asking for the \"fundamental differences\" between a Ford and a Chevy mid-size gas-powered car.\n\nThe fundamental differences are less technical and more political. They both have small, modular, extensible kernels that support threading, memory protection and hardware abstraction, ring-based execution security models, and sophisticated and complex software stacks designed to provide all the developer and user-facing features a modern OS needs.\n\nThe biggest fundamental difference is the majority of the Windows software stack is designed, developed and maintained by one company--Microsoft, whereas the software for UNIX-style OSes is produced by a multitude of different entities and assembled by the OS vendor. In addition, Microsoft maintains ironclad control over the Windows source code, keeping it almost entirely confidential from all but a few heavily-vetted and NDAd partners, whereas the UNIX-style OS vendors and contributors often choose to make their source code freely available to anyone who cares to view it.\n\nMost of the perceived advantages of either operating system with regard to the other stem from the closed-source-single-vendor versus open-source-multiple-contributor models of development and marketing.\n\nBecause UNIX-style OSes are built by multiple independent contributors, they are necessarily extremely modular at all levels of the software stack, from the kernel all the way up to the application. This makes it a lot easier to create highly bespoke UNIX-style OS implementations to satisfy extremely targeted needs such as servers of various types.\n\nBecause Windows is largely produced by a single vendor, it is unsurprisingly a more cohesive, integrated whole, which makes it easier for consumers to understand and use it."},

{"title":"ELI5: How does the body breaks down food into nutrients?","answer":"In very basic terms...\n\nFirst it breaks the food down into very tiny particles through some physical and chemical processes (chewing, churning in the stomach, acid, etc).\n\nNext, the tiny particles move into the small intestine, where a variety of enzymes attack them.  Enzymes are just proteins that do stuff.  The enzymes break carbohydrates down into sugars, fats into fatty acids, and proteins into amino acids.  By this point, your food is no longer food, it's a variety of very small organic molecules.\n\nThen, the body absorbs the organic molecules through the small intestine.  They enter the bloodstream.\n\nOnce the molecules get to a cell, they cell sucks them in through its cell walls.  At this point, the cell uses oxygen to tear apart the molecules to get electrons.  This process is very vaguely similar to fire.  These electrons are used to fuel the molecule ATP, which is kind of like a battery for the cell.  The little ATP batteries float around the cell, giving energy wherever it's needed."},

{"title":"ELI5: Power grids, and what's wrong with the US power grid","answer":"Power grids in general:\n\n3 major issues with power grids.  \n\nFirst thing is that power usually has to travel a long way.  Things that make power: nuke stations, coal plants, natural gas plants, hydroelectric, renewable.  If you look at that list, everything is either something you don't wanna live near, or something that depends on geography (hydro, most renewables.)  So it has to travel a long way.\n\nA very long power line is going to experience some loss.  However, if you step up the power (I don't know exactly what that means.  It's watts, amps, something.  I know you use a transformer) you'll lose less in that line.  And then you step the power back down so it's usable.  You don't wanna run a vacuum on the sort of power coming straight out of a big cross-country line.\n\nOther thing - power is very, very difficult to store.  You basically have to use it when you make it.  Batteries, you say?  Sure.  You can run an iPod on batteries, or an RC car.  But batteries are big, expensive to produce, difficult to get rid of in a responsible way, and just not feasible on a large scale.  \n\nSo you have a system where you experience loss traveling over long distances, most of the production points are far away, and you can't store it if you make too much.  Add to this the issue that renewables are very 'streaky'.  Wind works great when it's windy, not so good when it ain't.  Solar works great when there's sun, not so good at night.  This makes providing steady energy a lot tougher.\n\nThis doesn't even get into the issue that you need a power grid that can handle peak demand instead of average demand.  A power grid doesn't slow down like a highway system if you overload it, it just craps out.\n\nSo when people talk about smart grids, the goals are to get a) better preservation of power across distances, b) get production points closer to usage areas, and c) uses automation and lots of data to be better at switching and distributing power for greater efficiency.\n\nI know the goals and issues, but not the science and tech behind 'em.  Lemme know if there's anything else.\n\nEdit: Added something else 'bout renewables."},

As said in the top comment, the early basis in mythology and lore really gives you a higher appreciation of theology on a basic human level. I myself am an atheist but have a deep respect for the spiritual aspect of the world. \nHigh school in Steiner education is lacking, but depending on what school you go to and what teachers they have it can be perfectly adequate. The literature studied in high school (or mine at least) is also very, very good. Faust, Paradise Lost, Lord of the Flies, Animal Farm. These were the highlights. The sciences and maths were lacking, but luckily I was rather bright in those areas so it was never an issue or me.\nI'm rambling now, but I'd say almost all kids would get some form of advantage from the early years, however since traditionally Steiner schools teac reading at a later age there is issues if you try to move back to a mainstream school before reading is learnt.

{"title":"ELI5: Floating Point Numbers","question_detail":"I'm teaching myself Python, and I came across Floating Point Numbers. \n\nI did some quick searches on reddit, and one person explained that it was kind of like scientific notation. \n\n>ELI5: Lets take a long number : 54967952497524179478547. That's way too long.\nbut it imagine a number:\nit starts with a 5, the 3 following digits are : 496, and there were 22 digits total, but nobody cares about the rest, so we won't write them.\nand you get : 5.496 * 10 ^ 22, sometimes written 5.496 E22\nClever way to write very long numbers.\nit also works with numbers that start with lots of zeroes, you just start with the numers that arn't zeroes, and you count the digits between the first zero and your first non zero. (0.0000000953 -> 9.53 E-8)\n\nIs this correct? If it is, could you dumb it down a *little* more, just so I can be sure I understand it? ","answer":"You have a few replies already, but I'll try my hand as well.\n\nFirst, every number in a computer is limited by the number of bits it is allowed, and that number of bits limits the values that can be stored.  An 8 bit integer (unsigned) can represent integers from 0 through 255.  It simply cannot represent the number 915, or 3948519481.  There aren't enough bits.\n\nMost programming languages nowadays use 32-bit or 64-bit integers.  Even 64-bit integers are limited: the maximum integer it can represent is 18446744073709551615.  \n\nHumans, however, routinely deal with very large or very small numbers, particularly in science.  You might need to deal with 10^35 scale numbers if you're doing astronomical calculations, for example, or numbers on the scale of 10^-30 if you're dealing with weights of elementary particles.\n\nClearly those numbers can't be represented in 32-bit or 64-bit integers.  So computer scientists came up with a compromise.  They said, let's take those 64-bits we have, and trade some of the *accuracy* of integers, for better *range* of values we can represent.  That tradeoff is called floating point.\n\nAll floating point numbers are of the form xxxxxxxx*2^yyy .  The number of x's is the digits of precision.  The number of y's describes which power of 2 you use to multiply by.  It's really no different from the scientific notation such as 1.335*10^4, except it's base 2.\n\nNow, you can, more or less, represent numbers from 2^-yyy to 2^yyy.  This *greatly* expands the range of numbers you can represent, at the cost of precision: you only get a certain number of digits of precision."},

However, it's still slower than a 1.6ghz dualcore computer.  \nI'm aware a single core processor can only process one bit of data at a time, while a dual core processor can process two.","answer":"If you put two cores on a chip, you get twice(\\*) as much performance as one core, but it also takes twice as much area as one core and twice as much power.\n\nBut what if you could get 50% more performance for only 10% more power and area?  You'd do it, right?  That's what hyperthreading(\\*\\*) is.\n\nIt works like this: you don't double *everything* on a core, you only double a few pieces of the core in order to make it *appear to software* like you have two cores.\n\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nA lot of time, the \"ALUs\" and \"functional units\" of a single core are actually sitting idle!  Maybe the CPU is waiting for something to come back from memory and is just twiddling its thumbs.\n\nSo we use those idle cycles for a second \"thread\" to do stuff.  Then while the second thread is waiting for memory, we use *its* idle cycles to go back and do more stuff from the first thread, and so on.\n\nAnd if both threads (or all 4 or 8 threads for larger-scale multi-threading) are busy and neither one is idle -- **that's when you don't see any speedup** because then each thread is just taking turns, and actually stealing away time on the ALUs from the other thread.\n\nThat's why you don't get 100% speedup, because sometimes both threads want to do something at the same time, so one has to wait.\n\nBut you do get good speedup the rest of the time.   \n\n\nDetails (you don't have to understand the rest of this from here down, if you've already got the general idea):\n\n* Double the register file\n\n* Double the \"control state\"\n\n* Double *some* parts of the issue and branch-prediction logic.\n\n* (Optionally) add a few more ALU and load/store units (but you definitely don't have to double them!)\n\n[Technical Note: multithreading is more useful for in-order machines.  For out-of-order machines, you're already moving instructions around to keep the functional units busy, so there's comparatively less \"advantage\" to be gained by interleaving other threads in the \"dead\" cycles.  So making a CPU out-of-order PLUS multi-threaded is not always that smart of a choice.  Different companies have different philosophies on this.]\n\n(\\*) I know this is a bald-faced lie.  But it's ELI5 here, so we'll pretend for the moment that 2X peak performance == 2X average performance.\n\n(\\*\\*) Intel renamed it \"hyperthreading\" to make it seem like they came up with it.  The large amount of literature describing this technique for the 10+ years before Intel did it, usually called it [simultaneous multi-threading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_multithreading).\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: Dimples on a golf ball, how do they work?","answer":"When a fluid (such as air) flows around an spherical object like a ping pong ball, it creates a lot of drag. This is due to a boundary layer of slower moving air really close to the surface of the ball. A ping pong ball will have have a smooth boundary layer. Eventually this layer seperates from the ball. A smooth layer \"peels\" off the ball quite early, creating a big wake of turbulent air, think of a wake behind a boat. The dimples on the golf ball force the boundary layer to transition from being laminar to turbulent. This increases the speed of a the air moving in the layer, so it's able to stick to the ball for longer, and peel off the ball later. This creates a thinner wake, which creates less drag. \n\nThis image sums it up pretty well:\nhttp://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/aerodynamics/sports/sphere-flow-comparison.jpg\n\nA similar effect would be achieved by roughening the ball at the very front that's flying through the air. As long as the little peaks created by the roughness exceed the height of this tiny boundary layer, it'll force it to go turblent, and will therefore fly further. But then there's no way to guarantee that this little patch of roughness will be at the very front of the ball, so it's much easier to put dimples over the entire ball to ensure that no matter what, the boundary layer will go turbulent.\n"},

Can I have a general overview and in what fields/applications this is used?","answer":"I'm not sure if you actually want to know this, or are just having fun, but I'll take a stab at it (I've never heard of this field before now, but I do have a degree in Pure Mathematics, so I feel I should be able to do something here): \n\nDifferent shapes have different properties.  For example, a drum made in the shape of a circle will produce a different sound than a drum made in the shape of a square, even though both drums may be made from the same material and have the same surface area.\n\nThe field of Spectral Geometry is about studying certain properties that shapes have (a \"manifold\" is essentially a fancy math term for shape).  For a very simple example, one way of telling that a flat surface is different than a curved one is to compare the normals of two different points, and see if they are parallel or not (a \"normal\" is what you get if you take a stick and jab it into the surface such that it is standing straight up with respect to the part of the surface you jabbed it into).  They are just looking at slightly more complicated information about the surface.\n\nI'm not sure if this is being used anywhere in an applied way, but it seems like it might be very useful for determining the shapes of objects based on the sounds they make.  I could definitely see this being used in military or science applications... for example by putting a microphone underwater you may be able to tell the rough shape of an object making noise in the deep (a submarine or the loch ness monster maybe).\n\nConversely, it could be used to design objects with specific acoustic properties.  For example, if you want to design a speaker that delivers the purest possible music without introducing any weird frequencies from the sides or back of the speaker, you could mathematically find the optimal shape to damp out the undesired frequencies.  You could then sell your speakers to audiophiles for thousands of dollars each, with mathematical proof that they are the best.\n"},

But what happens when they default on their loans?\n\nI keep seeing all these headlines 'planning for the unthinkable'... etc.\n\nWhat are the bad consequences for the actual humans living there?","answer":"It is important to realise that most of the money that goes around in this world is not \"real\", but virtual money created from debt. It is essentially the belief that money is backed by something that is at stake in the crisis.\n\nSimple example: \n\nSuppose there is a total of 100 of whatever currency you prefer in the world (let's say euros, but it might as well be dollars or yuan or whatever).\n\nNow suppose that the person that had these 100 euros deposits them at a bank, in exchange for a -totally unrealistic- 5% interest rate. That means that for depositing the 100 euros, the bank will pay you 5 euros each year.\n\nNow the bank does not just keep this money, but rather it lends it to someone else, at a 10% interest rate. The lender then goes on to start his own business with the money, things go well and he makes some money of his own. After a year, this person pays back 110 euros, the bank keeps 5 and you get the other 5. \n\nBut, right now, you have 100 euros deposited in the bank, and the other person has 100 euros as well. So now there are 200 euros in the economy, but only 100 of those are \"real\". That is to say, the 200 euros is only backed by 100 real euros. The other 100 only exist because the bank has confidence in the lender that he will pay back the money, plus interest, at the end of the year.\n\nThis is a very simple example for a very complex system, but I hope you get what i'm trying to say.\n\nNow, traditionally, countries were always considered the most dependable of lenders, since it was assumed that if they could not pay back their loans, they could always increase taxes and pay them back anyway. However, recently this view has begun to change, prompting the debt crisis. Greece was in such bad shape that even if it increased taxes, it would still not be able to cover its loans. Subsequently it was bailed out by the rest of the EU.\n\nWhy? Because if Greece had defaulted on its loans, it would not only have destroyed all the money that people gave to the Greek state when they bought the obligations, but also all virtual money that was created based on the Greek debt. Needless to say, this would be a tremendous blow to the EU economy, possibly causing other countries to default as well, until ultimately almost all the wealth in the EU, and all countries that retain positions in EU obligations, would be destroyed (worst case scenario)."},

{"title":"ELI5: What does it mean if neutrinos travel faster than the speed of light?","answer":"Einstein's theory of relativity says that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. If it turns out that neutrinos can travel faster than the speed of light, it will mean that Einstein's theory is wrong.\n\nIf Einstein's theory turns out to be wrong, then all the theories we've built that are based on those theories will need to be re-evaluated. We might be able to \"fix\" some of them by making small adjustments. Others, we will have to throw out completely and start over.\n\nTheories that depend on Einstein's relativity include: How gravity works, how black holes work, how the universe was created, etc.\n\nIn terms of \"everyday life\", I don't think there'll be much of an effect, just like how when we found out that Newton was wrong about gravity, there wasn't much of a change to everyday life: The \"wrong\" theories were \"close enough\" for most purposes. The only \"everyday life\" area where Newtonian physics was not \"close enough\" and we needed Einsteinian physics is with GPS's: Your iPhone's map application wouldn't have worked so well if it were not for Einstein.\n\nOf course, GPS didn't exist in Newton's day, so for those people, essentially nothing at the \"every-day level\" changed when we found out Newton was wrong and Einstein was right. Maybe for us, nothing at the \"every-day level\" will change if we find out Einstein was wrong: our GPS's are \"good enough\" for our purposes, but maybe in the far future, they'll come up with some technology where the Einstein model is not good enough."},

Maybe at the last minute you decide that building a wall in the living room is not a good idea, even though the original plan said you did. Well, the contractor has already made plans to do so, they have the equipment to build it, and they bought the materials too.

{"title":"ELI5:What is happening in Iran?","question_detail":"From the storming of the British embassy to allegedly shooting down a US drone.

The CIA financed a revolution in Iran and appointed a king (the Shah) to lead the country.  He wasnt very well liked and was overthrown in 1979.  The Shah fled to America, when the US wouldn't return him for trial, Iran took the American embassy hostage for a year, this pissed off America so bad that they effectived green-lit a war against Iran; the Iran-Iraq war.  This war was bad, very bad for Iran.  Iran won, but at a huge cost of nearly of up to a million dead (the Iraqis used chemical warfare on a regular basis).  Additionally, at one point an American boat shot down a civilian airliner.  The Iranians obviously weren't happy and almost certainly helped set up a large attack on the American embassy in Beirut (by Hezbollah, who they created).  Pretty much since then, they have been fighting indirectly in all sorts of ways.  For example, its very likely that America (and probably Israel) have been the ones responsible for the deaths of several Iranian scientists, and its also likely that Iran has helped set up attacks on U.S. soldiers in Iraq."},

Space is a *partial* vacuum, in that it has no air; it's the closest one to a perfect vacuum that naturally occurs.\n\n**LI5**: Earth's atmosphere is like a bubble, like the soap bubbles you can blow with those bubble kits you get in your Christmas stocking as a kid.

{"title":"ELI5: How to solve quadratic equations by factoring, completing the square, and using the quadratic formula","answer":"More like ELI15:\n\nThere are a few different ways of representing a quadratic:\n\n* **a**x^2 + **b**x + **c**\n* **a**(x-**h**)^2 + **v**\n\nThe first one is usually how polynomials are written out, the second one is in a form that shows you how the function is stretched, shifted, and/or flipped from the plain x^2 function.\n\nIn the first form, you can solve **a**x^2 + **b**x + **c** = 0 using the quadratic formula,\n\nx = [-**b** +/-â(**b**^2 - 4**ac**)]/2**a** just by plugging in **a**, **b**, and **c**.\n\nYou can also factor it to find the roots, in the following way:\n\nLet's first imagine **a** = 1. So we've got x^2 + **b**x + **c**. We're looking for two numbers that will add up to **b** and multiply to **c**. This is because we're trying to factor it into a form that looks like (x+**p**)(x+**q**) and if you expand that out you get x^2 + (**p**+**q**)x + **pq**. So notice that **p** and **q** should add up to **b** and multiply to give **c**. \n\nThis is not too hard because usually **c** doesn't have that many pairs of integers that will multiply to it. So, if for example we had x^2 + 5x + 6, you would notice that 6 = 2/*3 and 2+3=5, so these are the two numbers we're looking for. Then x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x+2)(x+3). Now to find the roots it's easy enough: when is the result of multiplying two things zero? When either of those things are zero. So the whole thing will equal zero when either x+2 = 0 or x+3 = 0. This happens when x = -2 or x = -3.\n\nThings change a bit if **a** is something other than 1, but it's still not too bad. Now we've got **a**x^2 + **b**x + c, and we're looking to factor it into a form like (**r**x + **p**)(**s**x + **q**). In this case we're looking for two numbers that will add up to **b** and multiply to **ac**. The reason we do this will become clear in a bit.\n\nFor example, we could have 8x^2 + 14x + 3. Then we're looking for two numbers that will multiply to 24 and add to 14. In this case, 12 and 2 work. Now we rewrite out expression as 8x^2 + 12x + 2x + 3 (notice all I've done is split the 14x into 12x + 2x). From here, we factor out common elements of the first two terms, and the second two terms, separately. So 8x^2 + 12x have 4x in common that we can factor out, and we can rewrite those two terms as 4x(2x + 3), and in this case the latter two terms only have 1 in common so we rewrite them as 1(2x + 3). So our whole thing has become 4x(2x + 3) + 1(2x + 3). Notice that the (2x + 3) part is the same for both parts, so we can factor that out as well to get (4x + 1)(2x + 3). Again we can find the roots by figuring out when 4x + 1 = 0 or 2x + 3 = 0. These are easy enough to solve, and we get x = -1/4 and x = -3/2.\n\nSo as for the reason it worked to find two numbers that would add to **b** and multiply to **ac**...\n\nIf you imagine expanding out (**r**x + **p**)(**s**x + **q**), you get **rs**x^2 + **rq**x + **ps**x + **pq**. The two numbers we're looking for are **rq** and **ps**. This allows us to do the factoring and pairing off that we did in our example.\n\nAs for completing the square, that's how you go from the **a**x^2 + **b**x + **c** form to the **a**(x-h)^2 + **v** form. The nice part of the second form is that it's really easy to see where the *vertex* of the parabola is (**h**,**v**).\n\nSo we're starting with **a**x^2 + **b**x + **c** and we want to put it in the other form. The first step is to take the first two terms and divide out the **a**. Now we have **a**(x^2 + [**b**/**a**]x) + **c**. Next, we want to add something inside those brackets that will make whatever's in there a perfect square, so that we can turn it into something that looks like (x - **h**)^2 . \n\nRemember that factoring involves finding two numbers that will add to the middle coefficient and multiply to the end coefficient, only this time we know that it has to be the same two numbers, and our middle coefficient is **b**/**a**, and we're missing our end coefficient. The end coefficient is what we're going to add inside the parentheses. \n\nBecause we know it has to be the same two numbers and they have to add up to **b**/**a**, we know that it's going to have to be **b**/2**a**, and our end coefficient is just going to be whatever we get when we multiply that with itself. In particular, [**b**/2**a**]^2 . \n\nSo, we just add it in the parentheses and we know that that part will factor into (x + **b**/2**a**)^2 . But wait, if we're adding something, we have to make sure to subtract that same thing so that we're not changing our expression. We added [**b**/2**a**]^2 inside the parentheses, and there's a factor of **a** outside those parentheses so really we added **a**[**b**/2**a**]^2 to the whole thing, and that's what we need to subtract. Simplified a bit, that looks like [**b**^2 ]/4**a**. \n\nSo our whole thing becomes **a**(x + **b**/2**a**)^2 + **c** - [**b**^2 ]/4**a**.\n\nSo our **h** is -**b**/2**a** and our **v** is **c** - [**b**^2 ]/4**a**.\n\nLet's double check that what we did makes sense: the y-coordinate of the vertex (**v**) should be what we get when we plug in the x-coordinate (**h**) into our quadratic. So what happens when we let x = -**b**/2**a** in **a**x^2 + **b**x + **c**?\n\n**a**[-**b**/2**a**]^2 + **b**[-**b**/2**a**] + **c** \n\n= [**b**^2 ]/4**a** - [**b**^2 ]/2**a** + **c**\n\n= -[**b**^2 ]/4**a** + **c**\n\nGood, that's what we already had, so it makes sense.\n\nIt's actually not much further from here to get a proof of the quadratic formula, so I might as well explain it.\n\nWe want to know the values of x that makes the whole thing equal zero. Let's take it from our representation in the form of **a**(x + **b**/2**a**)^2 + **c** - [**b**^2 ]/4**a**. When does this whole thing equal zero? \n\nThis happens when: **a**(x + **b**/2**a**)^2 = [**b**^2 ]/4**a** - **c**\n\nWhich happens when: (x + **b**/2**a**)^2 = ([**b**^2 ]/4**a** - **c**)/**a**\n\nWhich happens when: x + **b**/2**a** = +/-â[([**b**^2 ]/4**a** - **c**)/**a**]\n\nWhich happens when: x = +/-â[([**b**^2 ]/4**a** - **c**)/**a**] - **b**/2**a**\n\nNow, for the part in the square root, we can multiply the top and bottom by 4a to get:\n\nx = +/-â([**b**^2 - 4**ac**]/4**a**^2) - **b**/2**a**\n\nNow, the denominator of the part in the square root is square, so we can easily just take the square root of it to get:\n\nx = +/-[â(**b**^2 - 4**ac**)]/2**a** - **b**/2**a**\n\nNow the two terms have the same denominator and we can combine them to get:\n\nx = [-**b** +/-â(**b**^2 - 4**ac**)]/2**a**. Look familiar? It's the quadratic formula. That's where it comes from and why it works to find the roots of quadratics.\n\nNote: teaching math is an interactive experience, so if something isn't clear feel free to ask me and I will try to give an alternate explanation or example to help you understand."},

Using imaginary pennies.\n\nImagine you have a penny tied to a string, and you're spinning it on the string over your head (like a cowboy with a lasso).  If you were able to release perfectly, at any given moment, the penny would go flying off in a direction tangential to the circle from where it was released (essentially at a 90 degree angle from a line drawn toward the middle of the circle).\n\nBut, you have that string, and that string is keeping it pulled toward the center.  So, each time it tries to fly off straight, it's pulled back toward the center, resulting in an arc (in simplest terms, it has force being applied in two directions 90 degrees from each other, so it goes in the middle of them).  Play that out every single moment, and you have a circle.\n\nBut, there are actually two forces at play here.  There is the centripetal force acting *by the string on the penny*, and a *centrifugal* force acting *by the penny on the string* (remember every force has an equal but opposite force; you push me, I'm pushing you).\n\nThat makes perfect sense for a \"pull\" idea of centripetal force.  But the cool one is when you're being *pushed* toward the center.  Penny time again (though I'll give more examples).\n\nImagine putting a penny on a turntable with a wall built around the edge of it.  As you increase the speed, the penny will make a larger and larger circle (as the friction of the surface of the turntable ceases to be enough force to keep the penny from moving tangentially a bit, resulting in a bigger circle) until it hits the wall.  When it hits the wall, suddenly it can no longer move tangentially to the circle, because there's a wall blocking the way.  Every moment, the penny tries to shoot off tangentially, but the wall is there pushing it in the direction perpendicular to the plane of contact (the \"normal\" force).  In this case, that plane is the tangential line of the circle, which means the perpendicular \"normal\" force applies directly toward the center (a centripetal force).  The wall is literally pushing the penny toward the center because the penny is trying to push through the wall to move tangentially.\n\nThis is the same thing that happens on the carnival ride where you stand against a wall in a circular chamber, the thing spins, and they drop the floor without you falling.  Because of the amount of force your body is doing against the wall (as you try to fling yourself through it), there is enough friction to keep you from sliding down."},
{"title":"eli5: Why is copper such a good conductor?","question_detail":"Cause [this shit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper) don't make sense","answer":"Atoms of metals connect to each other in a very special way. They share their electrons with each other, but not in the conventional sense where only two atoms grab on to the electron and hold it. Instead, the atoms are free to move about in a \"sea of electrons\" that flows between and around all the metal atoms. \n\nThis explains why metals are good conductors, but what's so great about copper?\n\nWell, copper atoms aren't very attracted to each other. which means that the \"sea of electrons\" has more wiggle room to move around. (They have only one atom in the d sub-level) \n\nCombine that with durability, ductility, stability, and relative abundance and you have the perfect charge carrier.\n\n"},
{"title":"ELI5, Asian last names. ","question_detail":"I've met a number of people (Korean, Vietnamese, Chinese) who can identify the country of origin sole based on someone's last name. E.g. nguyen is Vietnamese and Li is Chinese. But why do so many people have these names? Any other rules of thumb that correlate to Asian countries?","answer":"All I know is the family names in Japan are pretty varied because they got to choose their own. \n\nI was looking up wikipedia and this explains it pretty well\n\n&gt;Japanese family names are extremely varied: according to estimates, there are over 100,000 different surnames in use today in Japan. Common family names in Japan include SatÅ (ä½è¤) (most common), Suzuki (é´æ¨) (second most common), and Takahashi (é«æ©) (third most common).[1] This diversity is in stark contrast to the situation in other Sinosphere nations, there being very few Chinese surnames (a few hundred common, 20 comprise half the population), and similarly Korean names (250 names, of which 3 comprise almost half the population) and Vietnamese names (about 100 family names, of which 3 comprise 60% of the population). This reflects different history: while Chinese surnames have been in use for millenia and were often reflective of an entire clan or adopted from nobles (without any genetic relationship) â and were thence transferred to Korea and Vietnam via noble names, modern Japanese family names date only to the 19th century, following the Meiji restoration, and were chosen creatively. The recent introduction of surnames has two additional effects: Japanese names became widespread when the country had a very large population (over 30,000,000 during the early Meiji era â see Demographics of Imperial Japan) instead of dating to ancient times (population estimated at 300,000 in 1 CE, for instance â see Demographics of Japan before Meiji Restoration), and since little time has passed, Japanese names have not experienced as significant surname extinction as has occurred in the much longer history in China.[2]\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_name"},
{"title":"ELI5: Final Exams instead of Projects?","question_detail":"I'm in third-year engineering but this should apply to many different programs:\n\nWhy is it that courses insist on placing so much of our mark on the final exam, usually at least 50%. I would expect that large projects would more effectively convey how you have learned throughout the semester and would thus be worth more.\n\nAny good reason for this?\n\nEDIT: To clarify, I was referring to the fact that the exams are weighted so much higher than projects, not that I think exams should be removed. ","answer":"Being in CS/Math, I also feel the pain of heavily-weighted exams (I had a course that was 4 credits with a 100% final exam). I'd say, especially in engineering and science, courses are cumulative in learning - everything you do builds on something before it. You're not really learning material - you're learning how to reason your way through problems. An engineering final exam should be just a test on your problem solving abilities in the scope of some field. Plus, exams should teach you to work under pressure, manage your time, and explain your reasoning even if you cannot solve the problem in that time period.\n\nThis isn't always the case, though. Some professors expect you to memorize things you should be able to just look up (formulas and such), instead of actually testing you on your ability to rationalize problems and break them down into smaller, easier problems with reachable solutions.\n\nExams are also original work. Although group work is 100% necessary in any field of engineering, individual knowledge is paramount. Professors can be reasonably sure that your exam is completely your work. It's also much harder to bullshit a science exam than it is to bullshit an individual or group project. If you don't know the material, you can still complete an assignment with help from Google, your friends, and other resources. If you don't know the material on an exam, you probably haven't learned the material well enough to deserve credit (provided the exam was fair).\n\nI've mainly come to the reasonable (albeit cynical) conclusion that professors are just lazy sometimes. A three hour final exam times x amount of students is a lot less work to write and grade than multiple major projects and assignments throughout the semester for each student, even though projects and assignments along with an exam are, I feel, a better evaluation of real-world learning. If the professor is just there for the research, this is even more likely to be true. It's unfortunate, but c'est la vie."},

{"title":"ELI5: How can a 64-bit Minecraft World Seed Create an Infinite World?","answer":"its not infinite, its bounded by the hardware capabilities.  The world has a rule based on the seed, this rule will generate new areas of the world as you attempt to explore them, this simply reduces the cost of starting a new world, so that you dont spend all day waiting for it to create the biggest possible world it can.  However, it is limited by the programs memory space, which is pretty huge but not infinite.\n\nSo lets say that you have a computer with 8 gigs of memory, which is a finite amount of memory.  And you generate a minecraft world, this world will generate a small section at a time, but you play and play until you have created 8 gigs worth of world.  This world might seem huge, and might seem to extend for ever, but thats just your brain being fooled, it is finite still.  In fact it is exactly 8 gigs.  If you attempted to expand the world further your machine would error (depending on how minecraft handles an out of memory exception, it might just keep running and have you hit a wall, idk i didnt write the program)\n\nthe issue here is that infinite has a very very specific meaning in computer science and mathematics and most people simply do not grasp it, or assume incorrectly that big = infinite"},

{"title":"[ELI5] Why do electronics have to be turned off during take off and landing?","question_detail":"I understand that cellphones, radios, and things that have wireless capabilities can disrupt the communication for the pilot. But why do iPods, Gameboys, etc. have to be shut off? ","answer":"Most devices do not interfere with communications between ATC and Pilot - the rule is just-in-case. In fact, FCC has to approve devices sold in the US to make sure that they do not generate interference on bands they are not licensed to.\n\nHowever:\nA). Devices can malfunction and cause interference they aren't supposed to.\nB). Some devices are not FCC-approved (those made in foreign countries and not sold in the US, or devices that are hand-made or modified rather than purchased)\nC). Some devices are *designed* to use the same frequency as ATC radios. ATC radios, for example! Without a rule against it, you could bring your own ATC radio on the plane with you.\n\nIt's true that they could make either a whitelist or blacklist of devices that are ok or not ok, but it would be a lot of time and work. They would need to test each device and every update to that device to make sure it's ok. They would need to keep that list up to date. And that list would need to be available to passengers (and flight attendants). There would be a lot of confusion, as people might not be up to date on the list. Flight attendants would have to memorize the list so that they would be able to accurately tell passengers to turn off their device. As the rule stands right now, it's easy. If it has a battery and an on-off switch, you have to turn it off. Not to mention the fact that gameboys (DS) and iPods (touch) have wireless capabilities now, anyway! (and the number of people that flat-out ignore the rules and just leave their cell phones in airplane mode instead of actually turning it off)\n\nThe rules as written are a pretty fair compromise. Banning everything during takeoff and landing makes sense. At altitude if there's a problem with interference, the flight attendants can ask you to turn things off. There's a lot of time to fix the problem. When you're 100 feet off the ground (taking off or landing), you don't have that luxury. The airport is very crowded, both in physical space as well as electromagnetic space (lots of radios and radars). Allowing cell phones while taxiing to the gate is a nice compromise. ATC communication at that point is still VERY important (you could be crossing over active runways!), but if there's a problem, you can stop the plane and correct it without crashing.\n\nAs for the \"it's to make sure you pay attention\" part - if they wanted people to pay attention, they would also need to ban magazines, paper books, etc. It's not about paying attention or they would actually require that you \"review the safety briefing in your seatback pocket\". People barely pay attention enough to say \"yes\" when prompted to agree to the exit row rules."},

{"title":"ELI5: What is the Windows Command Prompt for? What can be done using it that can't be done in the GUI? ","answer":"The windows command prompt is a powerful tool for advanced computer users to get access to text based, automated, or non-gui tools. I will go over a few different types of users and how they each use the command prompt. This is in no way an exhaustive list.\n\n* Network Administrators/IT: Your common IT professional/helpdesk employee will probably use the command prompt to get access to diagnostic and information tools built into windows. \"IPconfig\" is probably the most commonly used of these tools, although it is not limited to professional IT use, many home users use this command when doing anything with settings that requires you to know your IP address. It simply presents the configuration of attached network adapters. Net Admins may have to use command line based tools (ssh/arp/nslookup/netstat) to connect to or get information about machines (routers/servers/etc) that don't run GUIs of their own or don't provide the information easily.\n\n* Programmers: Programmers using scripting languages (aka non-compiled languages like python or ruby) most likely use the command line to launch the programs they write or use. These 'scripts' are run via an interpreter which needs to be launched via the command like because arguments need to be passed to the program before it is launched. Programmers of compiled languages will most likely use the command line to run their static compilers then again to run the programs they have compiled.\n\n* Linux/Unix users: People who have grown accustomed to using Linux often find it easier to use the command prompt to do simple actions. Although Linux can be used entirely via the GUI the Bash terminal application included in most distributions of linux is extremely powerful and can do more things than would be remotely possible to list here. Windows users can install Cygwin, which is a program that adds most of the functionality of the Unix terminal to the Windows command prompt.\n\n* Power Users: Anytime you run a program that requires you to add switches (additional commands) to the program before it is run is easiest done from the command prompt, however this can be done by editing a shortcut every time, but thats a PITA.\n"},

If 230V is in socket, how can you survive even a second of 1.000.000 V?\n- How is it that it doesn't shock you when you are holding the person you are attacking (I'm talking about hand-paralyser)? I thought electricity circulates.\n\nThanks guys, I'm curious!","answer":"Our bodies work by electrical signals, which makes our muscles contract or relax. A sudden jolt of electricity can cause muscles to involuntarily contract or spasm, it takes our body a while to recover from that. Law enforcement generally use these devices to help restrain people who are disruptive as it is safe (a bit debatable though) and leaves no long term effects.\n\nElectricity isn't just voltage. It's more of a combination of voltage and current, which combined determines the power. The equation for power is P=VI, where P is power, V is voltage, and I is current. Now how do we get say... 1 million volts out of a 12V battery? Well we can just lower the current. Say we draw 1 million Amperes (the unit for current) out from the battery, that would give us P= (12V)x(1000000A)=12000000 watts. If we were to output that through your paralyser with a current of 12A, then we have 12000000 watts=(V)x(12A), and when we solve for V we see that it is now 1 million Volts.\n\nStun guns and other devices which incapacitate by electrical shock do so by using a very very very small amount of current. The very high voltage makes sure it hurts, and has lots of kick, but the very small current helps minimize the long term effects like burns. Higher currents also disrupt the heart's ability to beat. Your socket provides a relatively low voltage, but the current is high enough to where you have a lot of electric energy being pumped into your body.\n\nThe person using the device isn't affected because these devices are insulated at one end. That is to say, electricity has a hard time flowing through part of it, that's the side you hold. Electricity doesn't care how it gets to ground, so it finds the easiest path, usually the person on the non-insulated end. These devices generally do not work for more than a few seconds at a time, and once it's off, there is no longer any electricity flowing so the person is safe to touch."},

I understand that a country with 100 million people will grow faster than a country with 10 million people, but how did it start?","answer":"I can explain to you the reasons behind Chinese growth, although Indian growth I'm not too sure about.\n\nThe Neolithic revolution was the period that kickstarted human civilization and made possible the existence of cities and cultures. During this period, agriculture was invented in several different places at once. One of these places was China. Due to the fact that Eastern Asia was a vast, fertile plain with multiple long rivers, the predecessors to the Chinese civilization were able to spread far and wide, occupying vast stretches of land. Whereas in other places, the geography was too mountainous or harsh for people to properly diffuse and spread. Also, rice is a very versatile crop that can be grown pretty much everywhere in Asia in huge quantities, with a higher caloric content than European-grown grains. \n\nDuring the time of the Roman Empire abd the Ancient Greeks -- largely known as the Classical period of human history, the Chinese were also experiencing their Classical period, referred to as the Han Dynasty. Just as modern Americans like to compare their republic to the government of the Romans, the Chinese still refer to themselves as the Han people. The Han Dynasty co-existed alongside the Roman Empire during the same time, and were comparable in terms of military strength and economic prisperity. Under the Han dynasty, there was economic and social prosperity; the population went through a period of massive growth, aided by the fact that there were no regular incursions by nomads to disrupt the populace.\n\nDuring later dynasties, such as the Tang and the Song Dynasties, Chinese urban growth far exceeded that of the rest of the world. The Chinese imperial capital usually had a population of three million, with schools, hospitals, clean running water, etc, as opposed to European cities whose populations barely exceeded a few thousand on average, and were disease-ridden, dirty places with low life-expectancies. While Islamic and Native American cities came close to the scale of Chinese cities, Islam suffered regular destruction of their cities by Mongols, and the Native Americans would be almost entirely be wiped out by introduced European diseases. China was barely affected by Mongol occupation.\n\nAn affect of the colonial era was the introduction of crops native to the Americas into the ecosystems and farms of Europe and Asia. Before the 1500s, staple European foods like potatoes and corn did not exist outside of the Americas. In fact, one of the reasons for the explosive Renaissance population growth in Western Europe was the introduction of potatoes and corn as staple food items. Of course, this population boom was magnified in China, where corn would accelerate the population growth even further.\n\nIn population demographics, fully-industrialized countries tend to maintain a stable population due to advanced medicine, technology, and living standards. Parents no longer have as many kids because it isn't necessary. In unindustrialized third-world countries, populations are stable because the death rate is extremely high due to lack of medicine, education, and other factors. This high death rate is offset by women having many, many children to ensure that at least some will survive. In industrializing countries lile China, women are stilll having a large amount of children, although they have the benefit of modern medicine and education to ensure the survival of all of her children. This is what happened in China: a high population count with a high birthrate unable to be offset. In the future, as China becomes a developed nation, their population will stabilize and stop growing.\n\nAnother cultural reason that contributed to the high Chinese population is a traditional patriarchal tendencies of their culture. Men were held in higher importance to families, since they would work on the farm and look after their parents, whereas women would be married off to a different family and live with them. Because of this, families would often try multiple times for a son, if they only had a daughter.\n"},

[Here is the bottle in question](http://i.imgur.com/3N63ch.jpg), I fill the plastic cap at the top and put that in with the clothes in the main drum (is drum the right word?)\n\nI'd then close the machine, turn it on and go my merry way (this is after having sorted clothes into similar colours and put them in, obviously).\n\nWe also use [this stain remover spray](http://i.imgur.com/djfWjh.jpg) before putting the clothes in, if that helps any.\n\nNow, what I'd like to know is, **is there another way I could be doing this? What products should I buy?** (In the UK please!) I can't understand the words on the bottles, fabric softener is hardly ever labelled as such and I can only deduce it is softener by a crude drawing of feathers and towels on the side of the bottle. **What's bio/non-bio?

{"title":"ELI5: Supply and demand","question_detail":"Please explain this basic economic 'law'.","answer":"Think of an auction. There's one heirloom vase, and 50 people want it. They all want to outbid eachother, so it will be expensive. In this case, there is low supply(one vase) and high demand (50 people). **Low supply and high demand means high prices**\n\nNow think of something like chocolate easter eggs in May. No-one wants them anymore, so in order to sell their overstock, stores need to have very low prices to persuade people to buy them, or they risk having to just throw them away. In this case you have low demand (Not many people buy easter eggs in may) and high supply (hundreds of stores have spare easter eggs). **High supply and low demand means low prices**\n\nThat's the basics of it. So, typically, if you want to make a lot of profit from an item, you should aim for something with high as possible demand and low as possible supply, since this will let you give it the highest price."},

{"title":"Just in time for Christmas; why aren't women's dress sizes standardized like men's clothing sizes?","answer":"Mind you, sizing in men's clothes isn't actually perfect. Men's clothing pretty much all follows the same template (button front shirts, polos, pants, etc), but different labels/manufacturers/price points use a different 'dummy' for each size. A cheaper label like Gap wants to sell as much as possible, so they cut their shirts to fit as many people as possible--usually this means everything is pretty loose and baggy. A more select label like J.Crew knows it's not going to sell as many shirts, so they can cut them tighter to the dummy for a smaller range of body types, and they'll raise their prices to compensate for that. At the highest end, of course, you've got custom, bespoke tailoring.\n\nFit is everything in men's clothes, and it means the difference between simply covering your nakedness and actually looking good. One company's dress shirt might be too tight at the shoulders, while a similar shirt from a diff. company might have armholes that are too big. Since all men's clothes are pretty much designed the same, the only thing you can really compare is fit.

{"title":"ELI5: What is the sign for that starts off cuts in movies/tv shows?","question_detail":"It is the sign that is now digital, that has a moving arm on it that you see in blooper reels and stuff. I realize it marks off the begnning of a scene, but why not just have the actors say it, or somethng easier/cheaper, and why do they have an arm?  why not just have a sign?","answer":"OK, here's one I can answer!!\n\nYou see, when a movie is made, the video is recorded on one \"track,\" and the sound on another.  Sometimes this means they are on two, actual, separate pieces of film or tape!!  Now, you can't just LOOK at the tape and see exactly how to line up the tapes so that the audio and the video happen at the same time.  If you get this wrong, a person's mouth moves but the sound comes out late or early, making you laugh.  This is funny, but makes for a pretty bad movie.\n\nSo, many years ago, they invented a thing called a clap board.  Now, it's called a clap board because it does just that, it claps.  It makes a very sharp, short sound, and you can, with very old editing equipment, slide the tapes back and forth until you can hear the clap and see the clap at the same time.  Now the sound and the video are \"sync'd,\" which means they will run at the same time.\n\nNow remember, this was all a long time ago, way back when movies first started having sound.  A few things changed over time, better cameras, better microphones, that kind of thing.  But the idea of syncing up audio and video really didn't change until the idea of TIME CODES came along.  This was the first big change in making video/audio recordings, because it was an electronic way of saying \"THIS EXACT MOMENT IS WHEN THIS PARTICULAR BIT STARTS......NOW!!\"  So if you had this cool little device that would make time code, and one bit would be recorded on the video, and one part on the sound, it would be a lot easier to sync up later.  Then, a few years later, digital recording became a big thing.  Why is it a big thing?  Because you don't have to PHYSICALLY move the  tapes anymore!!  The problem with moving tapes is that A) they can get damaged, and B) you can end up being just a little bit off.  Now, most people won't notice, but if you're a little bit off in one crucial scene, the audience may just notice it.  And then they aren't going to be happy.\n\nSo, the cool part about digital is that you can get really, really precise.  And since your editing equipment is so precise, you need to have precise equipment, right?  So they invented newer and cooler clapboards, that are wired right into the recording equipment, and not only have cool little displays that show the time code, they can actually START AND STOP the timecode.  So now, your video, sound, and time code can all be synced up with one short, sharp \"clack\" of plastic, and your movie will look and sound better!!

{"title":"ELI5 Those little handwarmers you snap the metal bit \ninside to activate","question_detail":"How do they work?","answer":"You may remember from Chemistry class that when you cool water, the water/ice combination goes down to 0 degrees C and then stays there until it is completely frozen, and only then does it go below 0.\n\nWell, the liquid inside the handwarmer thing freezes at a temperature of around 50 degrees C.  When the handwarmer is at room temperature, it is below the freezing point.  So why doesn't it freeze, you ask?  Well, some liquids can be \"supercooled\" like dmukya said and linked to.  That means that the liquid is below the freezing temperature, but it hasn't frozen yet because it doesn't know the right way to fit together to form into a solid.\n\nWhen you snap the metal bit, that \"jolts\" some of the molecules in the liquid into the right position to form into a solid.  This starts the freezing process, which you can watch right before your very eyes.\n\nNow, remember the Chemistry class where water stayed at its freezing temperature until it was completely frozen?  Well, the amazing thing is that this will be true even if the liquid is supercooled.  While the liquid is freezing, it will warm up and stay at its freezing temperature (50 C) until it is completely frozen.  It takes a while to freeze, so it will stay warm for a while until it is completely frozen, then it will start to cool down again.\n\nThe way the recharging works is that you heat it up past its freezing point to melt it, then you let it cool beyond its freezing point without disturbing it so that it becomes supercooled again.\n\nNote:  I made up the \"50 C\" number.  I don't actually know the freezing temperature of those things, but it is somewhere between 20 and 100 C."},

I've searched \"tilt shift lens\" on Reddit and a bunch of other posts popped up displaying the same type of images. \n\nPics: http://imgur.com/2mxKo\n\nhttp://farm3.staticflickr.com/2188/2112904832_ce4768b5f9_z.jpg","answer":"This will seem a bit irrelevant at first, but just stick with me...\n\n*Depth of field* is basically the area of your vision that is in focus. The human eye automatically adjusts the our DoF when we focus on something, much like a point-and-shoot digital camera. Hold up your hand about 10cm in front of your face and look at it. Notice how everything in the background is blurry and out of focus? Now hold your hand out as far as you can and look at it, -the background should be a little fuzzy but not to the same extent as it was before. Now as you read this sentence, hold your hand up in front of your face but continue looking at these words, -your hand will be out of focus.\n\nTry to visualize your sight as a straight line from your eye to a point 1 kilometre away, kind of like [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Depth_of_field_diagram.png/440px-Depth_of_field_diagram.png). Now when you're looking at things close to your face, your depth of field will be very 'shallow', or thin. The only area that will be in focus is from about 5cm away from your nose to 10cm away from your nose, -a 5cm wide DoF. As the object you are focusing on moves further away from your face, the width or the DoF surrounding it will grow gradually wider. The DoF surrounding your hands at arms length will stretch to about 10cm in front of and behind of your hands. When you're focusing on a chair five metres away, the DoF will stretch from 50cm in front of the object to 50cm behind, and so on. The depth of field gets bigger and bigger as we look at things that are further away, so when we look out at a mountain range, pretty much everything from 30 metres to infinity is in focus.\n\nNow look at the 'tilt-shift' photos you've linked once more, and take note of what the focus, or DoF is like. Really shallow, right? *Just as we were holding it in front of our noses*! Basically, these 'miniature fakes', as they are sometimes called, work by presenting a scene that would normally be completely clear and sharp to the human eye with only a thin slice of focus. Because of how we are used to viewing the world, the brain says 'well obviously that's not a large scene, if it were it would be in focus', and draws the conclusion that it must be very miniature and diorama-sized. I guess you could say that it's a kind of illusion.\n\nThe way this shallow depth of field is achieved is by physically tilting the lens so that it's at an angle to the camera, which changes the shape of the depth of field and introduces some other concepts like the *plane of focus* and the *Scheimpflug principle*. It's pretty complex, and to be honest, I don't fully understand it. You can't do it with normal camera lenses though, you need ones that can bend themselves. Realistically though, 95% percent of the ones you see online have probably been artificially created in photoshop, as tilt-shift lenses are very expensive and the effect is hard to achieve, whereas it is relatively easy to fake. Here's some \n[before](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Jodhpur_rooftops.jpg/800px-Jodhpur_rooftops.jpg) and [after](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Jodhpur_tilt_shift.jpg/800px-Jodhpur_tilt_shift.jpg) shots of someone faking the effect on a computer. It's also important to note that no shift (vertical bending of the lens) is involved at all, only tilt (horizontal bend). Thus the name of the style is largely irrelevant and misinforming, I kind of resent that...\n\nIn retrospect this was a pretty big wall of text, tell me if any parts seem convoluted or not understandable. Anyway **I will photoshop a miniature version of a landscape picture, if someone cares enough to post one** (no obscenely low resolutions please). I can do one for you too OP if you would like."},

As the accuracy of this evidence and/or testimony would be suspect the writers of the Bill of Rights decided it would be a good judicial qualification.\n\nGood lawyers will craft their examination and cross-examination of the opponents witnesses in such a way that the witnesses (including the defendant if the defendant is called to testify) will be boxed in by their own statements to the point where they start contradicting themselves. Once this is achieved the lawyer has discredited the witness to the point where the jury can't trust the witnesses' statements.

{"title":"ELI5 - Onside kicks in American Football.","question_detail":"I only started watching the game this year (and love it so far), but I still don't get how an onside kick works exactly. \n\nWhile I've made this topic, instead of making a separate one, I'll ask it here too: how exactly do kickoffs and punts work? Sometimes the receiving team lets it bounce and come to a stop and never touches it. What's that all about?\n\nThanks. ","answer":"**Kickoff** - Beginning a half or following a score, one team will kick the ball off of a tee (ball holding device) at their own 35 yard line.  (If there was a penalty on the previous play, the ball may be kicked from a different yard line.)  Once the ball is kicked, the receiving team can grab the ball, thereby gaining possession, and run with it.  It doesn't matter if the ball bounced or if it's at a certain yard line.  \n\nFor the kicking team, they can also pick up the ball and run with it if they somehow can get to the ball first (or the other team drops the ball).  However, this rule has an obvious flaw: Couldn't a kicker just kick the ball right to a teammate?  To prevent this from occurring, there is another rule in place stating that the ball must be kicked 10 yards forward before the kicking team can recover the ball.  When a team performs an onside kick, they are trying to get the ball back instead of kicking the ball deep, so the kicker tries to kick the ball just over 10 yards deep.  Once the kick is made, both teams \"fight\" for the ball.\n\nA couple of other pieces of information about kickoffs: A ball that is kicked out of bounds into the endzone is a touchback, meaning that the receiving team gets the ball at their 20.  If a kickoff is kicked out of bounds, the receiving team gets the ball at their 40.\n\n**Punts** - These are done during a team's possession.  In other words, the ball is snapped to the punter and the offense must line up in a legal offensive formation.  The punter has no tee.  He just drops the ball and kicks it before it hits the ground.  A punt differs from a kickoff in that the defense effectively has first dibs on the ball.  In other words, if the punting team catches its own punt, the ball belongs to the other team.  This is why you'll sometimes see players chasing after a punt without stopping the ball from rolling further back.  However, if a player on the receiving team touches the punted ball, then anyone on either team can recover the ball.  \n\nAlso, note that a punt that goes out of bounds belongs to the receiving team at the spot where the ball went out of bounds.  Punts that go out of bounds in the endzone or are recovered by a member of the punting team in the endzone are touchbacks.  If a player of the punting team is standing partially in the endzone while grabbing the ball, it's also a touchback.\n\n**TL;DR:** On a kickoff, both teams can recover the ball once it goes forward 10 yards.  On a punt, only the receiving team can recover the ball, although the punting team can recover if the receiving team touches and drops the ball. "},

You tell your teacher you hate that upcoming rule, and she agrees. Some other kids also have told the teacher about how they hate the new rule. The teacher knows the principal better than you do, so she goes talking to him, trying to avoid the rule to be implemented.\n\nAt that moment, she's a lobbyist: a representative of a certain group of people (or companies), trying to have influence on the decisions to be made."},
{"title":"ELI5: hosts file.","answer":"Do you know what DNS is? To explain quickly: on the internet, all computers have addresses that are called \"IP-addresses\", which are just basically a string of numbers, like 121.241.12.15 or something. But it would be almost impossible for a human to remember those kinds of addresses when we want to go to a website, so instead a system called the \"domain name system\" (DNS) was invented, were websites would have these simple to remember addresses. Instead of typing in four nonsensical numbers, we just type in www.reddit.com. \n\nThe way this system works is that there are big huge servers on the internet called \"name servers\" that works like giant catalogs of IP-addresses. We type in www.reddit.com in to our browser, and our computer goes out to one of these servers and asks it what IP that is, which our browser then uses to actually connect to the server (I'm simplifying some stuff here, but this is the general idea). \n\nBut, on all computers there is something called a \"hosts file\", where we can make these mappings manually. So if we don't want \"www.reddit.com\" to lead to reddit, we can set it to whatever IP we like. You can also use this file to block certain sites, so that if you specify that reddit.com should connect to IP address 0.0.0.0, you wouldn't be able to go to reddit anymore, because that IP doesn't lead anywhere. \n\nSome people here on reddit has recently made some \"emergency\" hosts file in case SOPA happens and sites disappear from the net. The reason these works is that one of the things SOPA can do is remove a site's DNS information from these nameservers, so people can't connect using regular URLs anymore. The sites would still be online, but people wouldn't be able to find them. By putting the URLs manually in the hosts file, that would fix the problem for you, and you could still connect to them. \n\nNOTE: don't mess with the hosts file if you don't have a very good reason to. There's no point to it right now, DNS is a wonderfully ingenious system that works perfectly, at least right now. "},
{"title":"ELIF: Creative Commons and how to use it.","answer":"So any time you make any creative work, it's copyrighted by default, and you own the copyright. This gives you certain rights, saying that no one else can use your creative work without your permission. If you want people to be able to use your work (like a song, a story, a picture, a video, etc), you'll need to say so. \n\nOne way you can say so is by releasing your work to the public domain. This means you no longer own the copyright to it, everyone does. This means anyone can use your work for any reason they want, they can call it their own, they can sell it, etc. For some people, if you want to save some of your rights under copyright, but not all of them, this isn't a good way to go.\n\nCreative Commons is a bunch of different licenses you can release your work under.

Cheers in advance!","answer":"Hi there, I too was on SSRI's and I'll try to ELI5.\n\nYour brain cells use chemical's to talk to each other. Many chemical's are used for different signals and cell types, and one of the big ones in your brain is Serotonin.\n\nFor reasons yet understood, in cases of depression, you brain has less Serotonin than normal people, why don't know if this is a cause or effect of the disease, but treating it seems to help depressed people feel better. Now serotonin is complicated, and we can't just give you a pill, and IV use is not good for at home meds.\n\nSo how do we increase serotonin inside your head without putting more there? We can stop what ever takes it away, or decrease it's removal from the brain. There are special parts of the brain cell that 'reuptake' or recycle serotonin, so it can be reused as a messenger molecule later. SSRI's block these parts of the cell, leaving more serotonin outside the brain cell and able to carry on messages.\n\nThe 'selective' in their name comes from the fact that the drugs can target certain types of serotonin reuptake enzymes and leave others alone, minimizing side effects. These drugs, when monitored properly, are an amazing treatment for depression. The suicide risk has been over blown and when studies are redone, the risk for suicide only goes up when coming 'off' the medication, not when taking it. Also the effects of SSRIs and other psych meds takes weeks for the body to adjust, so give it time if it doesn't work. Too may psych patients and doctors cycle though meds too quickly to 'dial in' the proper med amount, it is a slow but useful process.  \n\ntl,dr; SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) work by blocking the recycling of serotonin and increasing the amount in your brain.

{"title":"How does PAR compression replace missing rar files?","answer":"PAR stands for \"parity\", and what it does is save parity bits of the different rar-files. A parity bit is a bit that states for a sequence of bits whether the number of bits set to 1 in the sequence is odd. If it is, the parity bit is set to 1.\n\nAn example. Let say you had 6 bits (btw a \"bit\" is one \"binary digit\", i.e. a one or a zero) that went like this:\n\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n\nAs you can see, there are three 1's in that list (an odd number), so the \"parity bit\" will be 1. Now lets say you \"lost\" one of the bits, so you have: \n\n0 1 x 0 1 0\n\nAnd you had no idea what the \"x\" is, but you know that the parity bit is 1. Since there are only two 1's in the original list, x has to be 1, because the parity bit is 1 (implying that there should be an odd number of ones, and 2 isn't odd). You could then use that parity bit to restore the lost x.\n\nNow, lets assume that you have file stored in four rar-files, and you've created a PAR file (i.e. a parity file). These are the rar-files, encoded in binry:\n\nrar 1: 010110....   \nrar 2: 101011....    \nrar 3: 110110....    \nrar 4: 111000....    \n\nThe parity file would then be:\n\npar 1: 110010....\n\nSo the first bit of the PAR file is 1, because three (an odd number) of the original RAR files first bits are 1. The third bit is 0, because only two of the \"third bits\" are 1. \n\nNow, some accident happens, and you lose the fourth rar file. So you have: \n\nrar 1: 010110....   \nrar 2: 101011....    \nrar 3: 110110....    \nrar 4: xxxxxx....    \n\npar 1: 110010....\n\nUsing that PAR file, you can figure out that the first bit of rar 4 has to be 1 (since that would make the number of 1's in the first position odd), the second has to be 1 (for the same reason), the third has to be also be 1 (because that would make the number of third bits even, and the parity bit is 0), and so on. \n\nUsing this method, you can restore any one of the lost rar-files. PAR is thus not a compression scheme, it is in fact the exact opposite: it adds redundancy so that if you lose some data, you'll be able to restore it."},

Didn't have a ton of time to research.","answer":"Okay, I'll give you an actual answer rather than refer you to other posts.\n\nAccording to the standard model of particle physics, there really is no explanation for as to why everything has mass, and that really might be the case. Everything might have no mass. Now, clearly, that MUST be incorrect. We all have mass, we're all affected by gravity, planets are affected by gravity, etc. It's clearly there, and so the answer to our conundrum is that there is a particle that is EVERYWHERE that interacts with EVERY particle and provides a sort of \"resistance\" that we define as mass.\n\nHere's an analogy that won an award for its simplicity (according to a physicist at the University of Nottingham):\n\nImagine you walk into a bar, and you find a 50 dollar bill. You yell \"I found 50 dollars, whose is it?\" All the people will come crowding around you, and they will all create resistance and your movement will obviously be slowed down.\n\nNow, imagine you walked in and you said \"I lost 50 dollars, who found it?\" everybody would try to divert their attention from you. Or imagine you smelled REALLY bad, everyone would try to get away from you and you'd have less and less resistance.\n\nBasically, the bad smell and the finding 50 dollars is the way we describe certain particle properties, and the particles that found 50 dollars are the particles that have mass. The particles that have serious body odour (like photons) are the ones that have no mass.\n\nBut, the people are also an analogy. The people are the Higgs-Boson particles. Except the difference between that situation and the universe is that these people are EVERYWHERE. Literally. There's a field that permeates throughout the entire universe, and the particles that compose everything are interacting with the Higgs-Boson particles every single Planck second of minute of every hour of every day of every week, etc. \n\nSo, to summarise it, there's a field of these Higgs-Boson particles that permeates throughout the ENTIRE universe, and everything interacts with them. It's a heavy, force-carrying particle, this Higgs-Boson, and the force that it carries essentially gives everything mass!"},

Most people read some DC titles and Marvel titles.  DC owns Superman, Batman, and a host of others whereas Marvel owns Spiderman, Green Lantern, etc.  The only major difference is that Marvel is having A LOT more success in its movie production (Ironman, Hulk, Green Lantern, Thor, Captain America), so that is really helping out in the revenue department for them.

In japan, the psp (as with most other sony products) is vastly more popular than it is in America.  Monster hunter is one of the premier games on the psp, so naturally, many people have it.  But why is it SO huge? I think it was first Monster Hunter: Freedom Unite that allowed players to hunt in groups of four.  The game now had a social aspect to it, so people wanted to get it to play with their friends in such.  But why not in the us? Since not as many people have a psp, not as many will have Monster Hunter. Since monster hunter isn't as much fun on your own, and since it wasn't marketed very strongly, it never really caught on in the US. Basically the only people who have it in the US are people who learned about from 4chan's /v/ board, like me.  It is very fun, but very time consuming and at times a grind.

That doesn't sound right to me, but I don't know. Wikipedia hasn't helped me understand it either. Can someone please explain it very simply? \nAlso, working with computers and servers, how does it apply to me?","answer":"The real question: *why three phases?*   Why all the weird stuff?\n\nSimple answer: it's weird because it's that darned Tesla again.  \n\nNikola Tesla invented the high-power 3-phase electric motor which runs all of modern industry.  His motor is driven by a 3-phase AC power supply and requires a 3-wire cable.  Tesla invented the 3-phase power grid to run his motors in factories nationwide.  Sold the patents to Westinghouse, who then trounced Edison and wiped out the old 2-wire DC system.  If your factory needs big motors, you buy the 3-wire type from Westinghouse.  If your city needs a megawatt power grid, Westinghouse Corp will sell you a 3-phase version.\n\nTesla's 3-phase motors aren't typically used in homes.   The three-phase ideas seem unfamiliar because we normally use two-terminal batteries, and we have 2-wire cords on AC lights and appliances.  (Well, some have three prongs, but the third wire is an unused safety ground, not 3-phase.)\n\nHere's the basic one-phase concept:  connect two electromagnet coils together.  Use two long wires to connect them in a closed-loop path.  Place a magnet inside the first coil.   Now when you shove a magnet into the second coil, the first magnet jerks!  Shove the second magnet in and out, and the first one moves in and out simultaneously.  The second magnet induces a current in its coil, and the same current in the first coil will attract and repel the first magnet.  That's the basis of all electric motors and generators.\n\nTesla had a brainstorm...\n\nHere's the basic three-phase concept:  connect *three* electromagnet coils in a triangle, and place a magnet in the center.   Next, make a second triangle with three more coils, and put a magnet in its center too.  Last, use three long wires to connect the corners of the separate triangles together.   Now for the magic:  when you spin the first magnet, the second magnet spins too.  Smooth rotation.  And no need for dirty, short-lifetime \"carbon brushes\" used in DC motors.\n\n[Edison Version](http://www.electric-history.com/~microns/004-PearlStreet.jpg), and [another](http://www.electric-history.com/~microns/005-EdisonGenerator.jpg)\n\n[Tesla/Westinghouse version](http://www.electric-history.com/~microns/004-Motor.jpg), and some [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP4aIUeQnt4&amp;t=0m37s)\n\nWell, not *that* simple.   If you want to understand all the details what's going on inside those coils and wires, you'll need lots of [animated pictures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotating_magnetic_field).  That, or basic high school trig classes.\n\nOnce you have a 3-phase system up and running, you find that there are other benefits.  For example, it turns out that three power lines can transmit *more* than three times the wattage, so 3-phase has a kind of magic high efficiency.  Another example, if you use a bunch of solid-state rectifiers to convert the AC into DC, you end up with very smooth DC.\n\n**tldr;  Tesla invented the 3-phase AC motor, which needs a 3-phase power system to run it.**\n\n."},

{"title":"Explain, please, the origins of various Christmas traditions (Santa Claus, trees, mistletoe, gifts, etc.) ","question_detail":"I've seen explanations of the origins of many Christmas traditions, but would like to know how they've been passed down and how we might be misinterpreting them. Why were these traditions assimilated by Christianity and Capitalism? ","answer":"Sure thing, boss.\n\nOn the Germanic pagan holiday of Yuletide, the god Odin was said to ride an eight-legged horse named Sleipnir who could leap infinite distances (modernised as flying reindeer) on his hunting trips across the sky. Sleipnir would be worked hard, so friendly children would put out food for him to eat on their roof. Odin would thank these kind children by placing a gift for them on their roof where the food was and blessing their home. Once houses started being built with chimneys as standard, he was said to leave gifts in the fireplace instead.\n\nDuring this holiday of Yuletide, people would cook up Yule logs, burn giant straw Yule goats, and sing Yuletide carols in tribute to the gods.\n\nYuletide is the biggest influence on Christmas. The other is Saturnalia, the Roman religious festival in Worship of Saturn, held on the third week of December. On Saturnalia, everyone was equal; slaves would wear garish red-and-green clothes, run around drinking with their masters, women were allowed into the all-male clubs, people would costume themselves and have Halloween-style parties. On December 23, everyone would offer gifts to each other, sometimes playing gift games resembling Secret Santa, and send poems like modern Christmas cards.\n\nAt harvest festivals in medieval Europe, sometimes villages would set up the biggest tree, feast and dance under it, then set it on fire as a spectacle. Christian churches would often hold religiously-themed plays around Christmastime, and the story of Adam and Eve would involve a tree being brought onstage as a setpiece. Eventually these traditions were combined, but smaller churches would decorate their modest trees with shiny things rather than actually burn them (since an 8 foot tall tree burning isn't that spectacular), and people kept that up when they started erecting them in their homes.\n\nMistletoe is used in religious myth as a symbolic representation of semen, and is eaten, smeared around and planted at fertility rites. I've never seen someone draw a connection between this and its usage at Christmas, but I'm just going to assume the obvious: mistletoe = semen = fertility = couples eat, plant, rub mistletoe around = associated with sex and romance = kiss near mistletoe.\n\nI'm always annoyed at myself when I can write something like this from memory. I can never remember important things because my brain is full of this shit.\n\n&gt; Why were these traditions assimilated by Christianity and Capitalism?\n\nThese traditions were established in Europe prior to the rise of Abrahamism and Christianity. As Christianity moved across Europe and started to become established, it puts its festivals at the same time as those of its competing religions to make it easier to blend itself with its neighbours and ease conversion. Easter, for example, corresponds to Eostremonth, a month of the pagan German calendar in which praise would be given to the goddess Eostre, who was associated with the Springtime, rabbits and eggs (eggs representing new life in the spring, rabbits representing breeding, fertility, and the spread of life)."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why in the morning my bathroom is room temperature, but my shampoo and body wash are freezing cold","question_detail":"Just wondering.","answer":"I might be wrong, but there is a property of materials called **specific heat capacity**. This is the amount of energy required to heat a set amount of the material up by one degree. In other words, the higher the specific heat capacity of the material, the more energy it needs to heat up.\n\nAt the beach, the sand is always hotter than the sea. Why? This is odd since they are both exposed to the same sun, and therefore the same amount of energy. Well, the sand requires less energy to increase in temperature than the water, so when exposed to the same amount of energy, the sand will get hotter.\n\nTo answer the question, I think **the air in the bathroom requires less energy to change temperature than the shampoo (the air has a lower specific heat capacity), so in the morning as the room heats up, the shampoo is exposed to the same amount of *energy* as the air, but is at a lower *temperature*.**\n\nEither that or what the other guys said."},

The magnetic field will induce a current in the metal, which will convert to heat because of the metal's resistance to current.\n\nWhy is it so fast?  Because it's efficient.  Compared to a regular electric stove, induction generates the heat directly in the bottom of the pan.  A regular stove would generate the heat in the stove , then transfer it to the pan by conduction, and to everything else in the vicinity actually.  It's both inefficient and slow.\n"},
{"title":"LI5 (or at least LI15): What is Circular Harmonic Decomposition?","question_detail":"I know that a Fourier Transformation does make a function \"time->amplitude\" a function \"frequency->amplitude\". What's the idea or application of Circular Harmonic Decomposition?","answer":"Okay here goes. We're going to have to start from the beginning though.\n\nSo the whole deal with using Fourier Transformations and Circular Harmonic Decomposition, etc., is to represent something in a different way.\n\n**Vectors and the Idea of the Basis**\n\nWe'll start with an example using *vectors* that's pretty easy to visualize. Say you wanted to give your friend directions on how to get to your house. To do this in an efficient way, you're going to have to first pick a *basis* with which to give your directions. A good choice would be the North-South, East-West basis. Using this basis, you could say go 5 miles North, 5 miles East. If you chose North and West as your \"positive\" directions, then you would say go 5 miles North, negative 5 miles West. This would mean the same thing. So that's one way to give him directions.\n\n**Choice of Basis**\n\nAnother, and equally decent way would be to use a Northwest-Southeast, Northeast-Southwest basis. In this case you would say go 7.07 miles Northeast, 0 miles Northwest. And voila, these directions are equally valid. \n\nSo, it seems you can choose any basis that has two set of directions to it. In the first case you have the North-South, East-West set, and in the second case you have the Northeast-Southwest, Northwest-Southeast set. You can in fact choose any pair of directions, as long as they're not lined up with each other (e.g., you could choose NNW-SSE, ENE-WSW and come up with yet another set of directions that would get you to the same place). \n\nWhatever basis you choose, you end up with a list of two numbers, or a vector. The first number describes how far you go in the first basis direction (how far North in the first example) and the second number describes how far you go in the second basis direction (how far West in the first example). However, the number two is rather arbitrary.\n\n**Mathematical functions are vectors**\n\nLet's say you live in a big city and everyone resides in tall apartment complexes. In this case you'd have to tell him how far to go in the two \"flat\" directions (those are the first two numbers mentioned in the previous paragraph) as well as what floor to go to. Thus, you get a third number to work with. Now you have a vector of length 3 (a list of 3 numbers needed to describe your directions exactly).\n\nNow let's say on each floor of your building there are several different hallways, and on each hallway there are several apartments. This means you have to give him two more numbers to completely specify your directions. And what do we have now? A list of five numbers, or a 5D vector. The idea is that you can go on and on. And on and on and on... until you might say to yourself, mathematically, I can have a list of 100 numbers (100D vector), or 1000 numbers (1000D vector), or *gasp* maybe even an infinite number of numbers (infinite dimensional vector). \n\nNow back to the 2D vector, using the North, West basis. If were giving directions to another place, say that was 4 miles north and 3 miles west, maybe I'd just like to say (4 miles, 3 miles), and hope that my friend knows that the first number is how far North to go and the second number is how far West to go. \n\n**Labeling the numbers in your vector/function**\n\nBut the labeling of these is arbitrary. If I have a list of 10000 numbers instead of just two, i.e., (3 miles, 6 miles, 1 mile, -5 miles, ....), coming up with names like North and West is going to get out of hand, so I will instead actually give each number a label with another number. So maybe I'll label the first number 1, the second number 2, and so on and so forth. But I could also label the first number 1.1, the second number 1.2, and so on and so forth and have the exact same set of numbers, just with different labels. \n\nSo we started with a 2D vector with places labeled North and West and we've ended up with a similar concept that is an infinity-D vector with places labeled 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc. Let's squeeze those labels together even more, so we get 1.01, 1.02, etc. If we keep squeezing, what happens is that our infinity-D vector actually starts to look like a *function*. So you might say your label is *x* and the value at your label is *y*. So given an *x*, you can look up that label and find the *y*. This is equivalent to saying given \"North,\" you can look up the value at the \"North\" position. \n\nThe conclusion from this part is that a mathematical function is actually very very similar to a vector. In fact, it is a vector, but of infinite dimensionality, because all a vector really is is a list of numbers. \n\n**Basis functions**\n\nBecause a function is just like a vector, that means we have just as much leeway to choose a basis for it, or just as much leeway to represent it. One way to describe it is just giving a list of all the y-values according to what x-value you're at, which is basically what we've done already. Another way to express a function with a new basis, though, is to use a very special set of *dun dun dun* BASIS FUNCTIONS. \n\nHow basis functions work is that you take all your basis functions, weight each one, and add it to the total. In a Fourier Series, your basis functions are sine/cosine, specifically you might have sin(x), sin(2x), sin(3x), and so on up to sin(infinity*x). To make a typical function, say some periodic function f(x), you can say f(x) = a*sin(x) + b*sin(2x) + c*sin(3x) + ... + n*sin(infinity*x)). If you knew you were using that set of sin functions, you could represent f(x) by saying what a, b, c, d, ... and so on were. Basically you'd have another infinite list of numbers that could describe your function just as accurately as your original list to. Neither one would be more or less accurate, they would just be different, and maybe one would be more useful for the specific application at hand.\n\nThe term circular harmonics is kind of just a fancy name for the basis functions used for the Fourier Series. The term makes sense because when you add another angle, you use something called spherical harmonics, which are kind of just like two-dimensional sine/cosine functions. \n\nIf you want to know any more let me know! I love this shit."},
{"title":"ELI5: Information Systems","question_detail":"What is the field of Information Systems about? What kind of work happens?

Usually IS are a short way of saying *Business Information Systems*, which studies the communication of information in an organization and thus takes bits of computer science, engineering, management theory and systems science, but it can be generalized in theory to any system such as a decision support system (which leans on artificial intelligence) or an information retrieval system.\n\n\nI can't speak for any other research areas but the ones that I am familiar with, but for instance current research in information retrieval systems (so more on the computer science end of the spectrum) would be to have theoretical models for machines that are able to understand what a document is about (its meaning) and retrieve these documents according to their meaning when you type a query in a search engine. \n\n**TL;DR** = takes bits of engineering, computer science, management, systems science to study how information flows in an organization."},

Here's what I think. I don't think anyone would dispute that environmental pressures and inherent genetic dispositions both have a part to play in how a person's preferences are shaped (cf. [Nature versus nurture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_versus_nurture)). \n\nBy environmental pressures, I mean things that happened *after* you were born. You're probably familiar with the phrase \"monkey see, monkey do.\" Babies and kids are hard-coded to try to mimic their elders, and I don't need to tell you about how peer pressure works. Environmental pressures come in all different flavors, but another one might be a negative connection between two things. Let's suppose that Susie Q's father always blasted country music loud when he beat her to drown out her screams. Susie Q would then probably *hate* country music because of the memories it brought back.\n\nBy genetic dispositions, I'm talking about things that are hard-coded in your genes. It's less easy to come up with an example for this one, but it's been conjectured by some scientists that some people are predisposed to overeating because of genetics that cause them to have a keener sense of taste.\n\nI don't have a degree in psychology or anything, but this is what I've picked up from my education and being a casual periodical reader.

{"title":"ELI5: Why Socialism is (supposedly) bad.","question_detail":"Every citizen is given equal opportunity. Health care is provided to all, and no person is above any other. So why, then, is this frowned upon? (Namely in the USA)\n\n","answer":"There are lots of reasons it's frowned upon. I'll try and sum up some of the important things to remember. My tl;dr is a quote from Winston Churchill \"You have enemies? Good. That means youâve stood up for something, sometime in your life.\"\n\n* **'Socialism'** in terms of the way that it's commonly defined, is quite broad in the same way as 'Communism' and 'Capitalism'. Socialism is generally derived from theories from Marx, although they existed before Marx ([See the Levellers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levellers)). Marx's theory says that there are two classes; the property owning class and the working class and that politics is generally skewed in favour of the Property Owners (the Bourgeoisie) and so Socialism is about having property in the hands of the many and not the few.\n* At the same time, [Adam Smith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith) and [John Locke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke) are two theorists who the people who dislike Socialism would get their views from (Ironically we call them **Liberals**). They would say that the actions of individuals allows for a free-er and more efficient society than one run by a strong central government. Socialism (but not some forms of Communism) on the other hand usually needs a strong state. So Locke and Smith would say it's an inefficienct system which is also quite oppressive.\n* So there is an ***ideological divide** between the more Socialist idea of being entitled to a minimum level of property and the **Government** runs the economy, and Market based idea where things are better run in a free **market** sense. The Cold War helped reinforce a clear divide between American \"Freedom\" and Soviet \"Communism\". (Actually it was more \"Loosely Regulated Free Market\" vs \"State Socialism\")\n* Socialism in the US sense includes European **Social Democracy**, which has a welfare state. Social Democracy is Capitalist because it works using a market and not a state to spread property but it guarantees a minimum standard of living and you have rights to certain things (like healthcare). Obama in my view is probably seen to be this by most Americans. The fact this is grouped with \"Socialism\" shows how the Cold War's \"[Freedom vs Communism](http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lo7axhvNyi1qebl4co1_500.jpg)\" style has radicalised and sensationalised analysis of political theory.\n* So to sum up, Obama isn't actually really a Socialist in the classical sense, but more of a Social Democrat. The Cold War radicalised the debate and so political analysis is simplified. But detractors say that Socialism is inefficient and oppressive and that Government should not decide how property is given out.\n* Hope that helps."},

{"title":"Explain (like I'm five): \"Jesus died for our sins.\"","question_detail":"Jew here.  I teach fifth, sixth, and seventh grades at a Jewish religious school.  A student asked me what it means when people say, \"Jesus died for our sins.\"  While I'm pretty knowledgeable on the old testament and Jewish learning, this question caught me by surprise.  First, I don't think I can speak for christians on their beliefs.  I sometimes try to explain those parts that are specifically explained in the new testament (e.g. The nativity story), this felt like a very subjective issue.  Second, I simply don't know the answer.  I don't want to give my students the wrong impression or information.\n\nI figure this is one of those areas where the subject may mean many different things depending on who you talk to.  I told my students I'd get some good answers for them during winter break.  Can reddit help me answer this question?","answer":"When Adam and Eve first sinned God slew a Lamb and made lambskin cloths for them to cover up their nakedness, shame, and sin.  That is where the annual sacrifice of the lamb came from, but you probably knew thatm. Jesus is known as the \"Lamb of God\".  He is basically taking the place of the annual lamb.  Because he was perfect, he never sinned, he was a perfect sacrifice, therefore, there is no longer a need for the yearly sacrifice.  All you have to do is believe in Him, and that he died on the cross so we could get into heaven.  Him dying on the cross/our only needing to believe in Him is also a mirroring of the Old Testament story of when Moses put the snake on the staff and the Israelites only had to look at the stick to be saved.  (I think it was a snake on a stick, not sure)"},

{"title":"ELI5: Difference between special relativity and general relativity","answer":"Special relativity starts with the idea that light will always go at the speed of light relative to you, no matter how fast you're going. Even if you're going at 99.999% lightspeed, if you shine a flashlight in front of you, the light will seem to outpace you by 186,000 miles per second. But to someone else, it will appear to barely pull ahead of you. \n\nEinstein accepted that, saying there's no fundamental difference between standing still and going a million miles an hour, you can only measure your speed relative to other objects. He worked out how it can make sense without being a giant contradiction. He said it's because when you're going close to lightspeed, time slows down, distances change, and you increase in mass. This last part also resulted in e=mc^2, which says a little bit of mass can convert into a huge amount of energy.\n\nSpecial relativity ignores gravity and acceleration. General relativity includes them, and says they're the same thing. If you're in a room, being pulled to one side by something that feels like a gravitational force, it could be because you're accelerating, or because you're on a planet. There's no measurement you can make, without looking outside the room, to tell the difference between those situations. So Einstein worked out the math to make sense of this, and ended up with gravity curving space, and time slowing down where there's more intense gravity."},

Is transitioning from web developing to android developing like night and day?    \n\nI was thinking about just going to go the cheap way and make a web client, but that isn't the spirit of making actual android apps.","answer":"There's certainly nothing wrong, or against any kind of spirit with just making a web app, and packaging it as an Android app.  It's quite common, and would often (perhaps usually) be the right thing to do.  Really the only time you need a native Android app would be when you need OS level functions, like hardware acceleration, graphics, and so on.\n\nAndroid apps are written in Java.  Your Javascript will help with the syntax, but the programming paradigm is different.  Javascript is prototypical, whereas Java is object oriented.  You should be able to pick it up though - it really depends on what you're trying to program.  A tablet version of Starcraft II might be challenge as a first project, even for a very accomplished web developer, whereas a simple wrapper for a web app should be a lightweight learning opportunity.\n\nHonestly, with PHP/xML/Javascript/CSS well mastered, picking up a new language shouldn't be very difficult.

{"title":"ELI5: Why I need to dial my area code when calling a local number","question_detail":"It wasn't like that when I was a kid.

As the city got bigger, cell phones became more popular, and more and more people required telephone numbers, the telephone company ran out of numbers in the (416) code. To allow for new customers to get a phone number, they introduced area code (647), covering exactly the same geographic area as (416). \n\nNow, two people in the same local area can have the same seven-digit phone number with different area codes: (416)123-4567 and (647)123-4567. In order to make sure that your call gets to the right \"123-4567\", you are now required to add the area code."},

Tax dollars must be spend to enforce the regulations, and business can often move to other states with less regulation.  But lack of regulation can also cause great damage:\n\n* a factory might have to lay off workers to be able to afford to process its toxic waster, which hurts the economy\n* but polluted water might make people too sick to work\n* a bank might inject more money into the local economy by loaning out its reserves\n* but if it didn't have enough reserves to cover its deposits, it could fail and cause the local economy to collapse\n\nIn some causes, regulations become to complicated or are poorly managed, making them an undue burden...some politician want to fix this problem.

{"title":"ELI5: How does binary turn into video games?","question_detail":"How do 0s and 1s turn into the video game graphics we know and love?","answer":"First: Binary is not a programming language, it is a number system that, in computers, represents on and off.\n\nComputers are made up of things called transistors. These are extremely tiny, currently being fabricated (or manufactured) as small as 22nm (that's *nano*meters, you could fit a billion nanometers into a meter) These have a logic function (that is, they take two inputs and generate an output) called AND. An AND truth table looks like this:\n\n    A B Y\n    0 0 0\n    0 1 0\n    1 0 0\n    1 1 1\n\nThis means that when power is applied to both inputs of a transistor, the transistor will output power. If you flip the output so that it looks like this:\n\n    A B Y\n    0 0 1\n    0 1 1\n    1 0 1\n    1 1 0\n\nThis is called a NAND function. With only NAND logic gates, you can create and other logic function: AND, OR, NOR, XOR, NAND. You can look these up on Wikipedia to see what they do. With a combination of all of these functions, you can make a can do anything. Add numbers, multiply numbers, calculate derivatives, integrals, etc. as long as you have the correct combination of these.\n\nThat's the basics of the hardware. Now, we go to software. CPU instructions know how to manipulate these inputs to generate outputs. Higher up is low-level programming language. x86 Assembly is what is used on modern computer CPUs, for example. These tell the CPU to execute instructions. \n\nNext are the high-level programming languages (such as C, Java, etc). This is what most programmers use because it's easy. These languages convert readable code (something like x=1000, which is a statement which would set a variable x to 1,000) into assembly code, which then executes instructions which manipulate inputs and outputs.\n\nIn summary:  \nA computer programmer writes high-level code, which is translated to low-level code by a compiler, which executes instructions, which tell the CPU to flip tiny little switches to make outputs. These outputs are then fed back into the program to use for whatever. They could, for example, be sent to a video card to draw to a monitor.\n\nedit: [here's another good explanation](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/o35l1/eli5_how_does_source_code_instruct_a_machine_to/c3e19l3) from a different ELI5 question relating to deeper CPU functions, if you're interested"},

If it's not in the cache and your DNS server can't find it,  it'll go up a level and ask, and up again if needed, until your query ends up at a root server, and that root server will look and find it on the network somewhere.

Is it something that happens on the internet or to a person's computer?\n\n\"Denial of Service\" sounds like some kind of error code. Is it a term that shows up on an effected computer?","answer":"It's something that happens to a particular computer, generally a server.\n\nFor instance, reddit is hosted on a server somewhere. When you want to go to reddit, your computer sends a message to that server saying 'please send me the reddit frontpage'...which it does.\n\nNow, technology is cool, so lots of people can ask for reddit at the same time and it can quickly send it to them all, but every request takes a little bit of computing power as the server computes what is needed, retrieves it from storage, and sends it again. When the number of requests gets really high, it just can't keep up with demand, resulting in virtually nobody getting sent reddit. This is a denial of service attack when done deliberately, which is easy by setting a computer/computers to repeatedly send requests very quickly. The computer doesn't have to care about the answer or anything, it's like going to a press conference and repeatedly yelling questions without listening to the speaker - they can't answer them fast enough.\n\nA DDOS attack is a *distributed* denial of service attack, which means that the requests are sent from lots of different computers, not just one.\n\nThis is, of course, a little simplified. In reality, the methods and results can be a bit different, but the core idea is the same."},
{"title":"ELI5: Why Israel seems a lot more developed and rich than many other middle eastern countries","answer":"To begin with, Israel isn't much richer than most middle eastern countries, since (a lot of them) have oil.  \nIsrael *is* more developed than most of those countries, and has a higher GDP(The amount the country produces in American $) per person.\n\nThe immediate cause of this is that the economies of the rich middle eastern countries is based on their natural resources (oil mostly), which Israel's economy is based on their human capital (an educated and technically competent workforce).  \nGoing one step back, countries that, at their foundation, do have a lot of wealth in natural resources tend not to invest that in human capital, this is called the [Resource Curse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_curse) and there are a lot of possible explanations for it, but no certain one, nor any one that fits every case (this happens a lot in Africa, as well).  \nIsrael, on the other hand, who only recently discovered natural resources (large natural gas deposits off the northern part of the coast), could not grow it's economy with any resources other than human capital.  \n\nThat is true for a lot of countries, however in Israel's history there were a series of both good decisions/policies on the part of it's government, and a flow of cash donations and resources from outside the country that enabled it to grow it's technology and defense sectors large enough to sustain a modern economy.  \n\nThe first part, the good policies, include most glaringly the large investment the Israeli army makes into maintaining a technological edge over it's enemies - Israel's army is a conscription army (every non arab citizen has to server for 3 years in the army) and it enabled people with a natural aptitude (and the an acceptable socioeconomic background) for technology to serve in the Israeli military intelligence, or in other technical positions in the army, which sent people who the army selected for a technological or scientific aptitude into the high tech industry, already with experience.  \nIn addition, a lot of the largest Israeli high tech companies were founded by people who gained some knowledge or another in the army, and then found a way to sell that knowledge in the civilian market ([NICE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NICE_Systems), [Elbit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbit_Systems), [Rafael](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Advanced_Defense_Systems) and more).\n\nMany of Israel's most successful institutions: banks, health insurance agencies, agricultural and industrial companies were founded as cooperatives, or within unions, with no profit motive and with the purpose of serving their members (rather than stockholders or executives) and developing the economy (Egged, Tnuva and Clalit are good examples of this).\n\nFor the second part, the universities in Israel were built early into it's history, with generous donations from north america and staffed with European academics that fled to Israel due to antisemitism in their home countries, many other institutions were also built with American and Canadian money and operated by European professionals."},

{"title":"ELI5: How does the US presidential voting system work and what are electoral votes?\n","answer":"The National Popular Vote bill would guarantee the Presidency to the candidate who receives the most popular votes in all 50 states (and DC).\n\nEvery vote, everywhere, would be politically relevant and equal in presidential elections. No more distorting and divisive red and blue state maps. There would no longer be a handful of 'battleground' states where voters and policies are more important than those of the voters in more than 3/4ths of the states that will just be 'spectators' and ignored.\n\nWhen the bill is enacted by states possessing a majority of the electoral votesâ enough electoral votes to elect a President (270 of 538), all the electoral votes from the enacting states would be awarded to the presidential candidate who receives the most popular votes in all 50 states and DC.\n\nThe bill uses the power given to each state by the Founding Fathers in the Constitution to change how they award their electoral votes for President. Historically, virtually all of the major changes in the method of electing the President, including ending the requirement that only men who owned substantial property could vote and 48 current state-by-state winner-take-all laws, have come about by state legislative action.\n\nIn Gallup polls since 1944, only about 20% of the public has supported the current system of awarding all of a state's electoral votes to the presidential candidate who receives the most votes in each separate state (with about 70% opposed and about 10% undecided). Support for a national popular vote is strong among Republicans, Democrats, and Independent voters, as well as every demographic group in virtually every state surveyed in recent polls in closely divided Battleground states: CO â 68%, FL â 78%, IA 75%, MI â 73%, MO â 70%, NH â 69%, NV â 72%, NMâ 76%, NC â 74%, OH â 70%, PA â 78%, VA â 74%, and WI â 71%; in Small states (3 to 5 electoral votes): AK â 70%, DC â 76%, DE â 75%, ID â 77%, ME â 77%, MT â 72%, NE 74%, NH â 69%, NV â 72%, NM â 76%, OK â 81%, RI â 74%, SD â 71%, UT â 70%, VT â 75%, WV â 81%, and WY â 69%; in Southern and Border states: AR â 80%,, KY- 80%, MS â 77%, MO â 70%, NC â 74%, OK â 81%, SC â 71%, TN â 83%, VA â 74%, and WV â 81%; and in other states polled: CA â 70%, CT â 74%, MA â 73%, MN â 75%, NY â 79%, OR â 76%, and WA â 77%. Americans believe that the candidate who receives the most votes should win.\n\nThe bill has passed 31 state legislative chambers in 21 small, medium-small, medium, and large states. The bill has been enacted by 9 jurisdictions possessing 132 electoral votes - 49% of the 270 necessary to bring the law into effect.\n\nNationalPopularVote\nFollow National Popular Vote on Facebook via nationalpopularvoteinc\n"},

{"title":"ELI5 Folding@Home","answer":"Well, to understand what's being done, you need to understand proteins. Proteins are tiny machines made out of organic chemicals. Due to chemical reactions, they move around, attach themselves to things, pull chemical pieces off one thing and stick them to another, etc, and in doing so they can perform complex tasks inside our cells, such as reading or copying DNA strands.\n\nYou also need to understand cancer, and its relationship with DNA. DNA of course, is the blueprints for our entire bodies. Inside each cell there's huge long strands of these blueprints, which are a list of chemical instructions to build a human body. Cancer is caused by damage to our DNA, which gives bad instructions to proteins, causing our cells to multiply out of control.\n\nBy studying how various proteins \"fold\", we can understand how they manipulate DNA, in order to copy it or interpret it as instructions for building cells. If we can isolate which proteins are responsible for screwing up our DNA and thus causing cancer, we can hopefully create a cure for cancer.\n\nSo, that's what this computer program does. It simulates various kinds of proteins, and how they fold, to see if we can figure out which are responsible for causing cancer. This is really complicated though, and it takes a lot of computer power to do these simulations. So, instead of getting one really big computer, they've spread out the work so that a whole bunch of small computers can do it."},

{"title":"EL5 the darknetplan","question_detail":"I saw the darknetplan subreddit and I just want to know what it is and how it works so i don't miss out on something if reddit shutsdown for some reason.","answer":"When people speak of the dark net, I think of Tor, or similar.\n\nFirst, I'll explain how there can be a vast amount of information on the internet that is largely unseen.\n\nBasically,\nLarge search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, rely on searching sites for mentions/links to other sites.  The more a link/site is mentioned around, the higher and more likely chance that it'll be the first thing on the google search when you search for related content.\n\nHowever, There is a SHITLOAD of content that is not easy to index for google's web crawlers and scanners.  (Google employs a LOT of servers that simply trawl and crawl over the internet, making notes of what is on websites and etc)\nThere is a SHITLOAD of uncatalogued content basically invisible to google, that resides on company/personal private networks, databases, home user's computers, and much much more, that aren't ever accessed by google's web crawlers.\n\nThere are some search engines specifically being designed to index and scan harder to get information, but the problem is that information remains, very hard to get.\n\n\nNOW, for Tor.  \nhttps://www.torproject.org/\n\nBasically, a good number of people got together and decided they wanted to make a \"secret\" network, that allows them to communicate anything they want in relative safety compared to the regular internet.\n\nBasically, they created their own large encrypted, circular network WITHIN the internet.  \nWhy circular?  They send your data around the world a couple times through multiple connections.  It makes it difficult to trace the original source or sender.  You have dozens of classmates in a circle all saying they don't know where the note the teacher found at the end, came from.\n\nWhy encrypted?  Not only does no one know where that note started or came from, the note is in code!  So when the teacher opens it, she can't make sense of it.\n\nWith the combination of\n- Not knowing where the message came from\n- The message is unreadable without a password (encryption key)\n\n\nI shall give you a link for use with tor.\n\nThe Hidden Wiki\nhttp://kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion\n\nNotice the link itself is a hash.  Since the tor network doesn't rely on central servers, and everyone's servers rely on the same system, people can even host websites from relative and secret safety.\n\nAs for the \"darknetplan subreddit\"\nIt sounds, without looking, like some sort of plan to move reddit underground into the dark net in the event that the government comes after it in the event of more internet censorship..\n\nAnd btw, people.  You should seriously revolt before reddit is taken down.\nReddit will be threatened, just you watch.\n\n\n\nBe careful when going through that information though, there are some things that you won't want to know or see.\nBe careful about any identity information you submit.\n"},

You need some extra electronics to convert the solar panel's electricity into a form that is compatible with the grid.

{"title":"ELI5 - Why does testosterone make boys moody during puberty?","answer":"Evolutionary psychology offers some insight:\n\n\"Physiologically adult humans are not meant to spend an additional 10 years in a school system; their brains map that onto \"I have been assigned low tribal status\".  And so, of course, they plot rebellion - accuse the existing tribal overlords of corruption - plot perhaps to split off their own little tribe in the savanna, not realizing that this is impossible in the Modern World.  The teenage males map their own fathers onto the role of 'tribal chief'...\"\n\nThis predicts that if you made teenage males fully responsible for themselves, such that they worked and made their own money and controlled their own lives, they would be much less moody because they would unconsciously view themselves as having acceptable social status.  They'd probably make piss-poor decisions so this is probably a terrible idea, but it would reduce moodiness.  \n\nThat analysis has nothing to do with testosterone.  The reason evo psych predicts teenage males should be moody in this situation and not teenage females is that it predicts males gain more reproductive benefit from risky strategies and hence males have evolved to be more willing to adopt high-risk strategies."},
{"title":"ELI5: LDAP","question_detail":"What is it? How does it work? What do you do with it?","answer":"It is a precursor to Active Directory services (AD).  Now what AD does is to grant various permissions on a network to various users.  Have you ever tried to install software on a PC at work and were denied the ability to do it?  AD is one way that things like that are controlled.  Someone inputs all of the user names in to the directory then allows or denies certain activities.  In other words it defines permissions.  Administrators and power users get more privileges than a normal user.\n\nNow I just described Active Directory, which is the Windows Domain Controller service.  LDAP is similar but earlier version of AD.  In addition to defining permissions for users on a network it also aids in various query activities. It is still in use today as I design software for a living and a requirement in the industry I am in is often \"Active Directory or LDAP Support\"..\n\nI know it is not a complete or technical answer but I hope that helps.\n"},
{"title":"ELI5: Tensions between Iran and the West","answer":"In 1953, the prime minister of Iran, Mohammad Mosaddegh, became extremely irritated. The British were ripping off his country's national resources. He wanted a greater share in it. The British came to the new president, Eisenhower, and asked for help on this. Eisenhower very conveniently declared Mosaddegh to be a communist, and we then sent the CIA to overthrow him.\n\nThe result was we brought the Shah to power and he created an extremely repressive regime, that within 20 years had led to a revolution against him. The Ayatollah Khomeini creates a government that is violently anti-American.\n\nIn the after action report by the CIA on what they had done in Iran in 1953, they said, \"We're going to get some blowback from this.\" We then made a puppet out of Saddam Hussein in Iraq, who was a friend of ours. He was an asset in the CIA's computers. We did so because he was anti-Iranian. He was very fearful that the revolution in Iran would spread into his country. He therefore went to war with Iran. The war was extremely bloody. It went on throughout the 1980's. \n\nUnfortunately for Saddam Hussein, he began to lose the war. At that point, in comes the United States in the form of Donald Rumsfeld sent to Saddam Hussein by President Reagan to tell him, \"We will supply you with intelligence, we will supply you with the weapons you may need through covert means.\" It is why cynics in Washington say, \"We know Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction. We have the receipts.\"\n\nThis is what we mean by blowback. He remained a friend of ours right up to his invasion in the summer of 1990 of Kuwait. We became alarmed when he invaded Kuwait, that he could also go on and invade Saudi Arabia itself, the largest reserves of oil on Earth. We stationed troops in Saudi Arabia. It was a mistake in every sense of the term. Remember, Osama bin Laden had said , \"I resent the government of Saudi Arabia for using Americans to defend Saudi Arabia against Iraq.\" At that point, we began to fear that we were going to lose our position in Saudi Arabia.\n\nWell, the second largest source of proven reserves on Earth are in Iraq. This leads us now to demonize our previous ally, and to prepare the American public for the thought that we must take him out.\n\nIn 1991, when the United States invaded Iraq, we established military bases in a land revered by Islam. Furious at the American government for desecrating their lands, bin Laden and his associates began plans that would lead to the clash of civilizations that culminated in the tragic events of 9/11.\n\nFrom http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IYoYaDNjnY"},

{"title":"ELI5: 1080p","answer":"OK, like you're 5. The picture on a TV screen can be thought of as being made up of lots of horizontal lines. Older TVs used to have 480 lines. Newer HDTVs have either 720 or 1080 lines. The more lines, the finer the detail. That's the 1080 part.\n\nThe p refers to progressive scan. Remember how the old TVs used to have only 480 lines? That's not the only reason they suck. The other reason they suck is that they would only draw every other line - first they would draw the odd numbered lines, then the even, then the odd again. If you ever took a picture of your old TV, you could see which lines it was in the process of redrawing. Drawing every other line is called interlaced. Progressive scan means that it draws all the lines each time. (Since you're 5, I won't go into any details about compression and decoding, and how some formats will only redraw the parts that are changing and leave everything else the same.) Progressive is better than interlaced. You want your TV drawing each line every time.\n\nThere used to be a lot of debates over whether 1080i was better than 720p. It's a question of tradeoffs. Are you ok with having interlaced (slower refresh rate) if you have better resolution? Or do you prefer having a faster refresh rate with lower resolution? No one could claim definitively that one was definitely better than the other.\n\nHowever, everyone could agree that 1080p was the best of both worlds. You get the higher resolution of 1080 lines and the faster refresh rate of progressive scan.\n\nThat is, until 4k TVs come out. Those will have 4000 lines. But you will probably be 10 years old by the time that there's real content for that."},

{"title":"ELI5: Short Wave Radio","question_detail":"What is it? What is it capable of? Is it viable as an a source of alternative communication should major lines of communication be lost?","answer":"Short wave radio usually means radio waves which transmit at a frequency between roughly 2 and 20MHz, in what is known as the MF (Medium Frequency) or HF (High Frequency) bands.\n\nBy comparison, a typical FM radio station transmits at a frequency between 88 and 108MHz, in the VHF (Very High Frequency) bands.\n\nRadio waves in the MF and HF bands have some interesting properties in terms of how they travel. Of course, if you are able to see the transmitter directly, without anything in the way, one can easily receive the station. This is called 'line of sight' propagation. However, in addition, these radio waves also go up into the sky, bounce off a part of the atmosphere called the ionosphere, and go back down to earth, which allows the station to be heard over very long distances. This is often referred to as 'skywave propagation' or 'skip.'\n\nThis has some huge advantages if you wish to communicate around the world at a low cost, since you don't need to pay for (or rely upon) satellites, undersea cables, leased lines, telephone circuits, or anything else. For broadcasters, especially state-run ones, it has been used to broadcast news, information, propaganda, language lessons, and everything else imaginable for nearly a century. Voice of America, Radio Moscow, Deutsche Welle, and the BBC World Service are a few famous shortwave broadcast operators, although many of them have scaled back their services as most of us in the developed world have access to reliable Internet infrastructure and expect to be able to get all that content there instead. Shortwave radio still plays a big role in getting news and information into the developing world, especially Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia.\n\nAmateur radio operators (also known as hams) have made much use of shortwave/HF radio for two way, low-cost communication for even longer and are indeed relied upon for communications in times of disaster, political unrest, infrastructure failure, and so on. You might be interested in chatting with us over in /r/amateurradio if you're curious about setting up your own operation and speaking with others all over the world."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why does it seem that the technology for computers has gradually and steadily advanced, as opposed to inclines and plateaus?","question_detail":"I'm not referring to the invention of new things such as when Plasma screens or solid state hard drives were brought out, but rather the rate at which these things are improved. \n\nThe easiest way for me to look at it is with hard drive space. When a few years ago you were amazed to fit 250MB on a USB thumb drive, we're now getting 4 gigs or more in the same amount of space, and this has been happening for years. As far as I can tell we've been using the same sort of hard drive/memory technology, what exactly are they doing to make 4 gigs fit where 250MB used to only be able to fit? \n\nAre they just making parts smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller? If so, why didn't they just make the parts small as hell to begin with? \n\nIt seems to me that tech like hard drive space has been growing exponentially without hitting any walls or plateauing off, so does this mean that they're making constant discoveries and breakthroughs one right after another?\n\nTLDR; How do they continue to squeeze more and more Gigabytes into the same size hard drives year after year?","answer":"&gt;Are they just making parts smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller?...\n\nBasically this. \n\n&gt;It seems to me that tech like hard drive space has been growing exponentially without hitting any walls or plateauing off, so does this mean that they're making constant discoveries and breakthroughs one right after another?\n\nAnd once again you've hit it with the part on \"constant discoveries and breakthroughs one right after another\"\n\nThe thing is that if you make *one* breakthrough you want to make money of it. And generally those breakthroughs has cost a decent amount of money. There is no guarantee that your next breakthrough will succeed. \n\nImagine two manufacturers trying to make new better products. \n\nCareful manufacturer: makes breakthrough and gets his product to market as fast as it can and starts getting back the investments when it can.\n\n\"Adventurous\" manufacturer: tries to leapfrog by making two or more breakthroughs before going into the market and gain an advantage. Problem is that \"careful manufacturer\" already has money coming in and can invest those in research and the adventurous type has to pour in at least the same amount (or preferably more to make sure to stay ahead). \n\nBut investors aren't really interested in taking that kind of gamble because they can't really see what the odds are of getting their money back because it rests on, at the time, unknown breakthroughs."},

{"title":"ELI5- during the cold war how did the US and the ussr test fire slbm (sub launched balistic missile) without triggering the other sides early warning radar nets?","answer":"There was a fairly extensive communication stream between the US and USSR during the cold war to keep each side aware of key activities so that the other side would not be surprised and misinterpret it as an attack.\n\nThe communications originally were mostly formalized through diplomatic channels via embassies and diplomats up to the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.  After that confrontation both the US and USSR agreed that nations as powerful as both of them with multiple ways to attack should have a more direct communication with each other.  Telephones were installed in the White House/Kremlin and other key governmental offices in the chain of command so that the leaders could more quickly discuss any unusual events.\n\nI read an interview with Condoleezza Rice where she said that after the 9/11 attacks caused the US to ground all air traffic to, from, and through the US and put the US armed forces on high alert the Russians called the US directly to tell them that a Russian military exercise was being cancelled due to the events and with the knowledge the US had enough to do without having to monitor the Russians.

{"title":"ELI5: Why do people say that the \"Separation of Church and State\" is nowhere in the US constitution?","answer":"/r/explainlawlikeIm5 is better for law-related questions, but I'll answer here:\n\nThe short answer is that the phrase isn't in the Constitution, but  the concept is.  While true in the narrow sense, the concept is definitely imbedded in the Constitution and in the American tradition.\n\nThe phrase comes from a [letter from Thomas Jefferson](http://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9806/danpre.html). However, the concept of separation of church and state comes long before Jefferson, from people like John Locke, Thomas Paine, and Roger Williams (he was the founder of Rhode Island - expelled from Massachusetts for his liberal beliefs, he viewed separation as necessary to protect the church from the state, and the state from the church).\n\nThe concept of separation of church and state, of course, is deeply tied into the Constitution:\n\n* The First Amendment on religion has two parts: The \"Establishment Clause\" (the government can't establish a church / impose religious faith on people / promote one faith over another) and the \"Free Exercise Clause\" (the government can't infringe on the free exercise of religion / inhibit people from practicing their faith). Today, in order to be constitutional generally the legislation has to have a secular legislative purpose; must not have the primary effect of either advancing or inhibiting religion; and must not result in an \"excessive government entanglement\" with religion. This is the rule in *Lemon v. Kurtzman*. There is some suggestion that over the years this test has been construed differently or modified from the original test but it's still a good test to use.\n\n* The \"No Religious Test\" clause -  This is in Art. VI, s. 3 and says that \"no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States\" - This underscores the concept\n\n* Equal Protection Clause - This is part of the Fourteenth Amendment, that says that \"no state shall ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" This is used only every so often in religious discrimination cases but it does come up sometimes. E.g., *Fairfax Coveant Church v. Fairfax County School Bd.* (Fourth Cir., 1994) (a law that sets rental rates of school facilities higher for churches than for other nonprofits is unconstitutional)\n\nFurther reading:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishment_Clause\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Exercise_Clause\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_v._Kurtzman\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bloudy_Tenent_of_Persecution_for_Cause_of_Conscience\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptists_in_the_history_of_separation_of_church_and_state\n\nhttp://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Letter_to_Touro_Synagogue (Washington's famous letter)\n\nDisclaimer: This is all massively simplified to the ELI5 level."},
{"title":"ELI5 why people smoke cannabis","question_detail":"I've tried it few times(in Netherlands of course) and I would say that it has mild effect and the effect is some kind of lightheadness - not pleasant nor euphoric.

My first few experiences were nothing special, but more recent ones have been quite different from that.

{"title":"ELI5: DiffieâHellman key exchange","question_detail":"A cryptography subject!","answer":"DH requires the use of two keys, a \"public\" key and a \"private\" key.  They are as the names imply:  one is given away to anyone that wants it and the other is protected and only accessible by one or a very few trusted entities.  The keys are mathematically linked together so that something that is encrypted with one can be decrypted with the other.\n\nThe idea works like this:  The public key is given to anyone that wants it.  Anyone can encrypt a message using that key, but only the holder of the private key can decrypt it.  In this way the message is secure if the private key is secure.  It also works the other way - if you encrypt something with your private key then anyone with your public key can decrypt it.  Not so useful since your public key can be anywhere and held anyone.\n\nBut - what if two people who want to transfer data securely BOTH exchange their public keys with each other.  They then take their partner's public key and combine it mathematically with their own private key to create a shared secret key.  Because of the mathematics involved (and, believe me, they are WAY beyond explanation in ELI5), the secret key is exactly the same on both sides.  If data is encrypted with this new combined secret key then only the people who hold both sides of the key exchange and combination can encrypt and decrypt to each other.  The encryption is considered \"secure\" (but only if the private keys on both sides are not compromised).\n\nSo let's look at an example:\n\nBob has a private key of value 1.  He has a public key of value 3.\n\nAlice has a private key of value 2.  She has a public key of value 4.\n\nAll of these keys are obviously different to each other.  But Bob and Alice want to talk without the NSA, CIA, or FBI or Homeland Security seeing it.  So they decide to do the DH key exchange of public keys to combine with private keys and generate the shared secret.  So they exchange public keys and combine them.\n\nBob now has his own private key 1 and Alice's public key 4.  He combines them for a shared secret of 5.\n\nAlice takes her own private key 2 and Bob's public key 3 and combines them for a shared secret of 5.\n\nTogether they have generated the same secret key through the DH key exchange and without actually transmitting the actual encryption key across an unsecured medium.  For some technical jargon they have used an *asymmetric* key exchange to generate a *symmetric* key that can be used in encryption and decryption."},

When you ask GoPricey (or someone like that) if a particular domain (mugwump.com) is available they'll report on its availability, but **also**, if it's available they'll register it immediately for a short time (a month?), called a \"taste.\" They say this is to allow you time to ask (them) for it, so that it won't disappear in the interim. **But** if you then try to register it with some other place (cheap-domains.com) they will find that it's no longer available.\n\nDoes this cost GoRipoff.com anything?

{"title":"ELI5 - Any audiophiles care to explain all the jargon?","question_detail":"Teach me to be like you. My virgin ears need it.\n\nEdit: Sorry, should have been more specific, I know. I mean to ask about the listening side of things (i.e. Headphones, Speakers, Amps, etc.)","answer":"As Pseudos has mentioned, you could be talking about any number of audio-related things, be specific!\n\nIn response to 'teach me to be like you', probably the most dramatic step you can take to improve your listening experience is to download or rip your music in a high *bitrate*. [Bitrate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_rate#Multimedia) is basically the amount of 'bits' of information in one second of an audio recording, and it's measured in kbit/s (kilobytes per second). The higher the bitrate, the more detailed and superior the sound quality will be (just like how a high-resolution image is nicer to look at than a small grainy jpeg). If you open up your media player (iTunes, Songbird, Winamp) and right-click on the column category bits (Artist, Album, Year, Song) you should be able to enable 'Bit Rate' as an info column. I would wager that most of your music is probably somewhere between 128 to 256kbit/s, but try find some tracks in 320 and &lt;100 and listen to them both, noting the differences in clarity and quality. The most common mp3 bitrates are 128, 192, 256, and the highest, 320. There are other types of 'lossless' audio files, like FLAC and .wv which come out to somewhere around 1000kbit/s, but as you will come to learn, improving your sound comes with higher costs for decreasing gains. In the case of lossless audio, the size of the file increases a fair bit for relatively small gains in audio quality. 320kbit/s MP3 files are the best balance between size and quality for most listeners, but once you get some nice headphones/speakers you might want to look into lossless.\n\nThe next step is obviously buying some higher-order listening gear. For most people this will mean headphones, -as they are more universally accessible than speakers and will generally offer a better sound for less money, but you might be a speakers guy? If you're looking into buying gear reply to this comment with the amount you intend to spend and what you are looking to buy and I might be able to give you some advice. Right now I'm using Audio-Technica ATH-AD700s and I would definitely recommend them as a midrange headphone, they are very good quality for the price ($150) and are *obscenely* comfortable.

I was hoping some one could do something similar with baby teeth.","answer":"Lots of animals have multiple sets of teeth.  Some (sharks) never stop growing new sets.  The evolution must therefore have happened a really long time ago.  \nIt makes sense.  We need teeth to eat, but our heads are still getting bigger.  If we kept the first set, we'd have tiny teeth in a huge space.  So we shed the first set and grow a larger pair.  \nEvolution probably restricted this to two sets, as it would take a lot of effort to grow teeth and you have to have an open wound (prone to infection) for a brief period while transitioning.  Also our heads only grow so big.  A third set, of potentially bigger teeth, would have killed the animal.  We do kind of have a third set.  Our wisdom teeth come in much later.  They would be helpful to push in the gaps from previous tooth loss.  Since humans don't lose too many teeth before breeding age these days the wisdom teeth need to be surgically removed."},

{"title":"Explain to me like I'm a precocious five year old the Vatican's view on condoms, the Pill, sex, and marriage.","question_detail":"I don't understand why sex between a married couple has to always be procreative.","answer":"Sex, in the Catholic tradition, does not always have to be for the purpose of procreation. Sex is viewed as a good thing, but within the context of marriage - it is an expression of love, and one of the ways in which God's brilliance is manifest. This act is incredibly personal, however, and because of this, the Catholic Church does not view it as appropriate outside of marriage. Within marriage, sex for pleasure is fine. \n\nSex, however, is more than a pleasurable act. It is also the means by which human life is created, and this sacredness cannot be removed from the act. To remove it is to demean it, in the Catholic view. As such, they do not view contraceptives favorably - BUT DO ALLOW ITS USAGE IN CERTAIN CASES. Using a condom is OK within Catholic relationships, if it is being used to prevent the transmission of a venereal disease from a husband to a wife or vice versa. \n\nThe Catholic Church is against promiscuity.

So if they go a whole day without selling anything then they need to make back nearly $1,000 the next day in pure profit to break even. If the rent were double (which seems common), they'd need to make $2,000.\n\nHow is this possible for stores that always seem empty?","answer":"Not the most politically correct answer I'm about to give but: \n\nSome of them are fronts for selling drugs.

Surely my representative won't actually answer. Will I be asking a secretary/AA to oppose the bill?\n\nAlso, what typically happens behind the scenes when people call their representatives' offices that makes this tactic effective?

Does it come up at a meeting that \"hey, Congressman X ... our phone lines have been jammed because people hate this bill...\" ?\n\nThanks!","answer":"Members of Congress are supposed to serve the needs of the people they represent.  In an optimistic sense, this means that if a congressman, along with corresponding staff members, learns that constituents oppose a bill, the representative will want to reflect the people's views and oppose the bill.  In a more cynical sense, politicians want to get votes in the next election.  Voting opposite the people's views can result in lost votes.  Therefore, it's in the politician's interest to vote with constituents. "},

{"title":"ELI5: Why are there different languages in the world?","question_detail":"Why don't we all just speak one language? Surely it would make things a lot easier.. Where do all these languages come from, anyway? ","answer":"Short version: meeting other people.\nLong version:\nMost languages evolved by people of speakers of different languages meeting each other, combining their languages, and have that medley grow into a whole new language. People who speak different languages will move next to each other. They will eventually start picking up words from their neighbors. Each generation will have more and more words in common, until it's a one new language. And then this process keeps happening. English is a great example. The Angles ran into the Saxons ran into each other. This created the language, Anglo-Saxon. They then ran into the Normans who spoke French. This created an early form of English. This early English absorbed words from other languages evolving of what is now the present form of English. Another good example is Dutch and Afrikaans. Dutch-speaking people moved to Africa and absorbed words from different languages than the people in the mother country and resulted in the formation of Afrikaans. A third example is Spanish and Portuguese. They have the same Latin roots but they differ because Spanish became much more influenced by Basque and Arabic.\n\nShort version: living close to other people vs. living further from other people.\nLong version:\nGroups of people that live close to speakers of other languages will have their language change quickly. Groups that live far from speakers of other languages will have their language change much slower. Icelandic and Norwegian both started out as one language, Old Norse, and are still the closet related languages to each other. Speakers of Old Norse moved to the isolated island of Iceland. On the island, they encountered a bunch of Celtic speakers in the years to come. This combination of languages evolved into what we call Icelandic. It only started becoming influenced significantly by other languages when modern transportation (ships and planes) and modern communications (phone, radio, TV, and now Internet) developed. As a result, Icelandic is still very close to Old Norse. Norwegian is less related to Old Norse because it was influenced by many more languages, due to geography. There was Swedish (also from Old Norse), Finnish, and Slavic languages (Russian, Polish, etc.) to the east. Then there was Danish, English, German, Dutch, French, etc. to the south and west. \n\nShort version: dying out.\nLong version:\nAs time goes on, speakers of languages keep meeting and meeting and new languages keep forming, while others die out. This creates the concept of politics. Groups of people who started speaking the same language start forming a common identity, called a nation. People who spoke various forms of Latin-based languages, Germanic-based languages, and Celtic-based languages immigrated (at different times) to what we know as France. All these languages combined into an early form of French. In France (and in every country) there areas where more people move to than other areas because of farmland and fresh water. The majority of people moved to the area around Paris in Northern France and their new form of French (heavily influenced by Northern European languages) became the most popular. As time went on, this group of new French speakers expanded more rapidly than other groups and became the dominant force of people in the region (numbers and militarily). There were people in the south of the region who spoke different forms of French (dialects), like Occitan and Provencal (more influenced by Southern European languages). Then nations evolved into countries with physical borders, also known as the modern nation-state. The dominant group imposed their dialect as the common language. This resulted in laws that made it forbidden to teach (and sometimes speak) Occitan and Provencal, as well as other smaller regional dialects. With each passing generation, the number of speakers of dialects other than standard French has become smaller. This trend has grown even faster with the advent of modern communications (radio, TV, Internet). Occitan and Provencal are mostly spoken by the elderly and are considered endangered.\n\nMany languages have died out throughout history. Prominent examples include Latin, Sanskrit, Ancient Greek, Aramaic, and many more. Some dead languages (like the ones mentioned) are preserved and understood by scholars and religious leaders, despite not being used as spoken languages. Others are simply lost to history. Smaller regional languages and dialects are quickly dying out all over the world.\n\nWe are slowly evolving in the direction of a common language. We may never get there but it sure looks like it's going that way. Especially now that so many people use the Internet and travel/immigrate to other parts of the world. English is a great example of this. It originated from a small island in Europe. English speakers moved all over the world in large numbers, especially to North America, Australia New Zealand, and South Africa. Later on, English speakers colonized vast areas of Africa and Asia and imposed their language on the conquered people. Hence, one of the reasons why English is the dominant language of the world. It was spoken in so many parts of the world by so many people, either as a first or second language. It didn't hurt that the U.K. and U.S.A. were world powers who also had an influence on much of the rest of the world's politics and culture. You can see this now with the predominance of English on the Internet, and in popular culture (movies and music) which is exported to all parts of the world. \n\nShort version: language versus dialect and politics.\nLong version:\nThis part gets a bit complicated so read carefully! What we consider languages and what we consider dialects are not absolute and concrete terms. The common assumption is that speakers of of what we call different languages cannot understand each other (mutual intelligibility). The other common assumption is that speakers of what we call different dialects can understand each other. But neither of those assumptions are true all the time, mainly due to geography, politics, and religion.\n\nWhere both assumptions hold true: English and French are considered different languages because speakers of each language won't understand each other. American English and British English are considered different dialects because speakers of each understand each other. \n\nHindi and Urdu considered are considered different languages but are mutually intelligible: Modern day Urdu speakers live more to the west and modern day Hindi speakers more to the east. But the Urdu speakers are mostly Muslim and the Hindi speakers are most Hindu. Over time, the religious divide grew stronger and both groups considered themselves separate nations and called their mother tongue two different things. This divide has only gotten stronger as Urdu speakers dominate in Pakistan, Hindi speakers in India. Urdu has absorbed more Arabic, Persian, and Turkish words due to Islamic influence but it has still remained mutually intelligible with Hindi. \n\nSerbian, Croatian, and Bosnian considered are considered different languages but are mutually intelligible: Geography, politics, and religion again. Bosnians are in the north, Serbs in the South, and Croats to the west. Serbs are mostly Easter Orthodox, Bosnians mostly Muslim, and Croats are mostly Catholic. Religion divided the people into different nations. Politics divided them into different countries. Each group considers themselves unique and calls their language and themselves something different.\n\nAlgerian Arabic and Iraqi Arabic are considered different dialects but are not mutually intelligible: Most people who speak each dialect consider their ethnicity to be Arab, meaning they believe they have a common identity that originates in the Arabian peninsula. They also have a common Islamic identity. Both started out the same language. But Algerian Arabic has a lot of vocabulary in common with Berber languages (indigenous languages of North Africa), as well as French influences (colonialism). Iraqi Arabic has a lot of vocabulary in common with Kurdish, Persian, and Turkish. Algerian Arabic and Iraqi Arabic share a lot of vocabulary with their common Arabic base, but outside influences have drastically changed the two varieties to where they don't understand each other. Despite geography, politics and religion are why they consider themselves the same language. \n\nCantonese and Mandarin are considered different dialects but are not mutually intelligible: In the West, we oftentimes don't even make the distinction between the two, and merely call them both \"Chinese\". Mandarin is spoken in the north and Cantonese is spoken in the south. Both started out as the same language, but were influenced by outside languages but because speakers of both lived in the same empire and shared the same Confucian-Buddhist heritage, both are considered Chinese dialects and not separate languages. Like the case with Algerian and Iraqi Arabic, Mandarin and Cantonese, despite geography, are considered the same language because of politics and religion.\n\n\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: Animated Movies/TV shows","question_detail":"Do they really have to draw out every frame? Or do they use some sort of wizardry? I've always been curious about this.","answer":"It depends on the kind of animation.\n\nTraditional animation was very rigid. First, a master animator would draw out \"key frames,\" (the major poses in a sequence) in rough, loose pencils on paper. Lower level animators called \"in betweeners,\" would draw all the frames in between, usually by dividing spaces in half. For example, the key framer would draw frames one and nine. The key frame would then draw frame five (between one and nine), then frames three (between one and five) and seven (between five and nine), and then all the even frames.\n\nThese loose pencils would then be cleaned up and given all their detail, and then cleaned up again of any stray lines. These \"final line,\" pencils would then be traced by a new artist using ink on clear sheets of film. These sheets of film would then be passed on to painters, who would paint all the colors in by hand on the back of the film sheet, which is called a cell. Someone would also have to paint a background on a separate, usually larger sheet of paper. After all the frames were painted, they would be photographed one at a time in front of the painted background. Tada! Now you have traditional animation.\n\nIn modern times, things are changing a bit. A lot of steps are being taken out. Computers will often eliminate the need to trace final line to cell; you can just ink directly on top of final line. No need for painting either, because you can digitally dump in colors. There are still some things that need to be done by hand though, and mostly, that's the actual frame-to-frame animation.\n\nSome digital tools are changing this, though. One popular tool is a program called Flash, which is made by Adobe. Flash Animation actually works more like puppetry than traditional, hand-drawn work. In Flash, you don't have to draw every frame- you create an original drawing composed of many separate parts that you want to move. From there, you can set up those parts in specific poses which are also called keyframes. The computer uses math to determine the difference between the two poses, and then fills in (in betweens) all of the frames that exist between those two poses. Flash animation has positives and negatives. On the positive side, you can produce very smooth animation inexpensively and quickly. On the negative side, Flash animation tends to end up looking very flat and robotic, because the character models don't dynamically change frame to frame. They just move about, like paper dolls. But Flash tools are becoming more complex, which allows for more realistic animation than ever.\n\nFor a comparison between the two, consider masterful modern (but traditionally made) animation of The Illusionist and Paprika, respectively-\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMqpU7lUlLg\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anu2IrsUlVs&amp;feature=relmfu\n\nCompare these to Flash animated shows like Archer, which represents some of the best Flash used today-\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41dQluLTKDo\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: The United States relationship with Puerto Rico","answer":"Puerto Rico has been an unincorporated territory of the USA since 1898 when it was taken from the Spanish after the Spanish-American war. It has a form of self government that is subject to the US government under a territorial clause. And even though it is not a sovereign nation, Puerto Rico's residents can't vote for the president or get representation within the government of the USA.\n\nPuerto Ricans are natural born American citizens. In fact, Puerto Rico has more American citizens than 22 states of the USA (23 if you count D.C.) Their citizenship is identical to the citizenship of the rest of Americans and the limitations that Puerto Ricans have are a result of their residence. For example, a Puerto Rican can't vote for the president while he lives in Puerto Rico but he can vote if he moves to an incorporated territory. Also, a Puerto Rican can't be the president of the USA unless he has lived 14 years in incorporated territories of the USA. But these requirements also apply to non Puerto Rican Americans.\n\nAccording to the two last status referendums in the island less than 5% want independence and about 46% wants Puerto Rico to become a state. The rest of the population wants a relationship between Puerto Rico and the USA to exist but the nature of this relationship is not well defined.\n\nBeing a US territory Puerto Rico uses US currency, the US postal service, and Puerto Ricans have American passports. Puerto Ricans don't pay federal taxes, are recipients of US welfare, and are participants of programs like the Social Security and Medicare. Puerto Ricans can join the US armed forces, were drafted in the past, and Puerto Rico had active US armed forces bases.

{"title":"ELI5: Explain why the reactor at Chernobyl exploded?","question_detail":"I mean, I know there was some sort of malfunction, but go a tiny bit more in-depth.","answer":"They shut down the automatic safety systems to do unauthorized tests. These tests put the core in a very unstable condition. They had a bad design of core that when you shut it down, the power spikes momentarily. The core was so unstable the power spiked uncontrollably which heated up all the water and caused a steam explosion.\n\nWhat is more interesting (and complicated) is how they got there. Reactor cores have a poison that builds up in them called \"Xenon\" which slows down the nuclear reaction. Normally, it builds up and burns off at the same rate, so you dont really care about it when the reactor is steady, but when you do very large power changes, those rates get off for the next 12+ hours and it can cause your core power to swing around. If you don't have experience operating a core under high xenon poison loads it is very difficult to control and in all cases (except chernobyl) automatic safety systems shut the reactor down as a result. \n\nIn Chernobyl, they had recently went from 50% to 100% full power on their core, then back down to below 25%. In the process of reducing power, the xenon levels built up so high that it nearly shut the core down. The reactor operator disabled the safety systems and pulled all the control rods out to restore reactor power and prevent it from shutting down. As the core power started coming up, it started burning off the poison faster and faster than it was producing it, and at this point, the xenon poison was the only thing controlling the core's power level (since all the rods were removed). The core was \"stable\" but was just shy of prompt critical (the state where power runs out of control). When they finished their test and went to shut the core down, their shutdown system is flawed in that during the first fractions of a second of the shutdown, it increases reactivity in the core a little bit. This was enough to cause the core to go prompt momentarily and cause the power excursion which caused the steam explosion."},

Long story short:\n\n* The Security Council determines whether there exists \"any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression\" and the either makes recommendations for further action or, in more extreme cases, decides \"what measures shall be taken... to maintain or restore international peace and security.\"\n\n* The Security Council then calls on the parties concerned to comply with \"such provisional measures as it deems necessary or desirable\" to resolve the conflict without prejudice to the rights, claims, or position of the beligerents; this is important, because the Security Council will take into account any failure to comply with these \"provisional measures\" later in the process.\n\n* Next, sanctions are considered. The Security Council \"may decide what measures *not involving the use of armed force*\" are to be employed to enforce the provisional measures we talked about above. This usually means calling on some or all UN members states to apply a number of different kinds of sanctions, such as \"complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations.\"\n\n* If that doesn't work, shit gets real. The Security Council can \"take such action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.\" This might mean something military but not offensive (a \"Chapter 6.5 intervention\" like peace-keeping or a blockade) or military operations carried out by member states.\n\nIf you need specifics (or want to know where the quotes come from), check out [articles 39-42](http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter7.shtml) of Chapter 7.

{"title":"ELI5 how a solar farm takes sunlight and converts it into household electricity.","question_detail":"As detailed as possible please","answer":"There are two types, photovoltaics, and concentrated solar power.\n\nPhotovoltaics are like what you'll sometimes see on people's roofs, they're also used in space alot, and sometimes for large scale power stations (Nellis Solar Power Plant is an example of one of these).\n\nThey're pretty technical, basically they exploit whats called the photoelectric effect. Light can be thought of as tiny little particles of light, named photons. When these photons come in and hit atoms, sometimes they can \"knock\" an electron and give it a little more energy. In the photoelectric effect this causes them to jump up an eletron shell, but thats not important. In photovoltaics however due to the unusual properties of the silicon semi-conductors they're made from the electrons can be \"knocked\" between areas of the material. This leads to there being a small electrical current as the electrons move. If you get lots and lots of this stuff that small electrical current can be usable.\n\nBasically photovoltaics turn light directly into fairly low powered electricity, so you need lots of them. The Nellis power plant i mentioned earlier is 140 acres of pannels and makes 14MW (For reference a nuclear or coal power planet might make 500 - 1500MW).\n\nNext is concentrated solar power, this sounds fancy but basically is just using a bunch of mirrors to focus sunlight on a single point, then you have some kind of material, often a molten salt where the light focused and you use the heat from that to turn turbines like you do in conventional power plants.\n\nPS20 in spain is an example of this kind of power plant, it generates 20MW, taking an area of about 210 acres. It has fields of mirros that focus light onto the top of a tower. The complication comes that the mirros need to be focused correctly onto the molten salt vessel, and as the sun moves through the day the mirrors need to be continually rotated. \n\nAnother example is Solnova, also in spain, which uses a field of \"parabolic troughs\", basically semi-circular mirrored troughs, which removes the need for moving the mirrors. The Solnova plants give 50MW each for 280 acres of land. "},
{"title":"ELI5: WiFi and Small Devices.","question_detail":"I understand the concept of how WiFi works, but what I don't understand is how a small, not powerful device like a cell phone can communicate with a router a fair distance away. Explain it please :)","answer":"Cell phones are actually surprisingly powerful. \n\nHowever, what you are referring to is called gain. It is measrured in dB, or dBm when measured against 1 milliwatt. \n\nWhen you receive a signal, you can amplify it and make that signal and everything around it get bigger. You can then use a filter to only allow the signal you want."},

{"title":"How to I make a website?","question_detail":"Please explain how to do this. (like im five :D)","answer":"*blink* This is ELI5, not HowTo. Anyway.\n\nFor starters, there are certain programs on your computer that allow you to browse the Internet. These programs are called browsers (makes sense, huh?) The most known browsers are called Firefox, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari, Opera and quite a few whose names escape me.\n\nWhat a browser does is reading in text from a file on another computer which is accessible through the Internet. (Strictly speaking, it doesn't read text, but ones and zeroes, but let's forget that for a moment.) A text can be a normal text, like\n\n\"Story of Bob and Sally\n\nBob met Sally. Suddenly, they fell in love, and absolutely nothing could stop it. Then they lived happily ever after and died on the same day in a car accident\".\n\nNow, there are certain elements that tell the browser *how* to display the text. Those are usually not visible on the screen and are part of a whole language called HyperText Markup Language (HTML for short). You can most likely select View-&gt;View source or something to that extent somewhere in your browser, and it will displays the HTML code this site is written with.\n\nWith HTML, you can write the text like this:\n\n\n\"&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Story of Bob and Sally&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bob met Sally. Suddenly, they fell in love, and absolutely nothing could stop it. Then they lived happily ever after and died on the same day in a car accident.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\"\n\nh1 indicates a heading. When a browser reads the &lt;h1&gt;, it will know that the text between &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;/h1&gt; is supposed to be bigger than the one in p (paragraph), so it will usually display it bigger. [Here](http://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_intro) is a very similar example.\n\nWhat is this good for, you may wonder? Well, you can do all kinds of fancy things with those elements, using another language called CSS. For example, you could make the whole paragraph pink (wouldn't that be awsum) or make the heading slightly bigger if you don't like the way it is. You can even make menus for a site that only appear when you hover you mouse over them.\n\nBasically, you do three steps.\n\n1. Create text for your site.\n2. Create the HTML code that you wrap around parts of the text. \n3. Change how those parts look like using CSS.\n\nThere are sites, programs etc that will do parts 2 and 3 for you. For example, if you have a blog, the blogging software will most likely create most of the HTML and CSS for you.\n\nGo to [W3C Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/html/) to learn more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},
{"title":"How do antennas work?","question_detail":"How do antennas transmit? How do they receive? Can you receive more than one channel at a time? Why do wireless access points use multiple antennas?","answer":"The way I think of it: antennas vibrate really quickly, and their kind of vibration makes other things around them vibrate. A vibrating antenna might make the air around it vibrate, and then the air makes another antenna a few yards away vibrate. So the second antenna is now vibrating because of the first one, and the are vibrating the same way. The second antenna has \"received\" the first's vibration.\n\nBut the antennas don't just vibrate in one mode like a tuning fork. The way (the speed and shape) of their vibration changes all the time, very quickly. The way that it changes is controlled by some other thing, say an amplifier or a radio transmitter. And in that special way that it vibrates, there is encoded information, kind of like morse code. But instead of just dit-dash, there are hundreds of ways to encode the information. The second antenna might have a piece of hardware on it (a radio) that \"decodes\" the special vibrations. The way that you can receive more than one radio channel at once is by telling the decoder to only listen for certain types of messages (only listen for dits, or some combination of the way the other antenna is encoding the information)."},
{"title":"ELI5: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors.","answer":"I answered a similar question the other day with the following:\n\n&gt;Since this question can't be answered without invoking eigenvector mathematics, I'll take the liberty of assuming you're a particularly clever five year old.\n\n&gt;Okay, so an eigenvector equation is something like Ox = ox, where O is an operator (such as d/dx, differentiation in x), o is an eigenvalue (just a number), and x is a vector. It's simply a way of writing one of each of these things such that the equation is true. There's nothing more profound here than there is in saying 'x+y=1' and trying to find x and y.\n\n&gt;There's nothing particularly interesting about this on its own, but this particular mathematics idea happens to be extremely useful in the real world (and in lots of more advanced maths too). For instance, a differential equation may be an eigenvalue equation. Differential equations describe...well, everything in the world, so physicists and engineers naturally depend heavily on eigenvalue mathematics to solve them.\n\n&gt;It also seems that the idea of eigenvalues has a kind of fundamental importance in quantum physics. Unsurprisingly, this area heavily involves differential equations, most simply the Schrodinger equation. In these cases, the eigenvalue is some property of the system, the eigenvector is the wavefunction of the quantum system, and the operator is whatever is necessary to get that property. For instance, the 1D momentum operator is (-i * hbar * d/dx); applying this to the wavefunction is equal to the momentum of the system times the wavefunction. It actually turns out that if the eigenvalue of an operator is always real, the operator describes some measurable property of the system.\n\ntl;dr: They happen to be a really useful piece of mathematics that describe a lot of real world problems. Therefore, being able to manipulate them is valuable.\n\nSince this question is asked fairly frequently, you can find several other answers [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/search?q=eigenvalues+eigenvectors&amp;restrict_sr=on)."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why do we almost always have to pee after we poo?","answer":"The prostate is a male organ that wraps around the male urethra sort of like your fingers wrapped around the neck of an inflated balloon.   If your fingers are tight, the air in the balloon stays put.    When your rectum is filled with feces, it exerts pressure on the prostate, \"tightening the noose\" around the urethra so to speak.   After evacuating your bowels, the pressure is relieved allowing the bladder to be emptied.\n\nRelated: The prostate gets bigger as men get older and eventually puts enough pressure around the neck of the urethra that even with an empty colon, you aren't able to completely empty the bladder.   Consequently, it gets full quicker and you have to start getting up in the middle of the night to pee.   There is an operation called a TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate - or \"Rotor-rooter job\" in layman's parlance :) ) that usually relieves the situation."},
{"title":"Many questions about West Point Military Academy","question_detail":"Hey, and thanks for your help!\n\nAs a canadian who is very separated from the military in general, i find myself asking questions about west point on a fairly regular basis. This has caused many questions in my mind, which I will list\n\n1. It seems every major military commander has attended west point. Do all soldiers attend the school? that seems highly unlikely, but is there a certain division or rank that ALWAYS attends west point? or is it more of the harvard of the military, closed yet constantly producing the top soldiers?\n\n2. What does 'admission' to west point entail? do you need to serve elsewhere first and be admitted? Is it based on grades or military ability? do you apply or are you head hunted?\n\n3. Is it safe to say that all those who attend westpoint are quite superior in one way or another? Not so much in the literal sense, but I mean does attending the school give people an automatic prestige such as an ivy league school?\n\n4. how heavily does parental and familial pressure on the academy lead to some people being accepted? is it purely random or do the sons of generals usually have an easier chance to attend?\n\n5. what is the main focus of the academy? is it purely military, or do you get a degree from it at well?\n\n6. In a chicken egg question, is the reason that the most well known military members seem to have all attended west point because the academy produces the best? or are the best simply fed through the academy just to get the name on their wall and propel them not through aptitude but recognition?\n\n7. Generally, how old are the students? Is attending west point the kind of decision you make early on, essentially putting yourself on the path to the military and forgoing other ventures in lieu of this path?\n\n8. What 'kind' of soldiers does west point produce? generals? infantry?\n\nin general, what is the overall relevance of this one particular military academy, and why do the most well known names in the military seem to have all attended the academy? Why do we hear about it so often?\n\n\nso many questions, if you guys can cover any that would be great.","answer":"1) No, not all soldiers attend West Point.  West Point is the United States Military Academy, the official academy for officers in the US Army.  The equivalent in Canada is Royal Military College, in Kingston.  Rank and file soldiers do not go to these places.  West Point is a university and when a student graduates, they receive a degree, as well as the rank of Second Lieutenant in the army.\n\n2) In order to attend West Point you have to be nominated by your congressman.  So in addition to having top grades, being physically fit, an having a good service record, you also need to have your application rubberstamped by your congressman. It is very competitive and generally about 15% of applicants will be admitted.\n\n3) It's a different kind of prestige.  West Point grads, as you noted, have a long tradition in positions of authority in the United States.  Presidents Grant and Eisenhower both attended West Point, as did General Patton and General MacArthur.\n\n4) Like any other private university, those considerations matter.\n\n5) It is not purely military - it develops students in every way to become officers, through leadership training, fitness, personal development, tactics, and, yeah, good old fashioned coursework.  All cadets graduate with a Bachelor of Science.\n\n6) West Point is the oldest military academy in the States and as such it's steeped in tradition, but it isn't the only one. There is also the Annapolis Naval Academy and US Air Force Academy.  You can also get officer training at select few \"civilian\" universities like Virginia Tech or Texas A&amp;M.\n\n7) Candidates must be between 17 and 23 years old, unmarried, with no legal obligation to support a child.  So, yes, you need to decide young.  Other than keeping your body in peak physical shape, your high school years won't be unlike anyone who is trying to get into an Ivy... solid coursework, school involvement, and public service.\n\n8) Officers.  As I mentioned above, cadets graduate and become Second Lieutenants.  They are then free to climb the ranks in the Army as they progress through their careers."},

{"title":"What exactly is a \"delay tolerant network\"","question_detail":"This came up in a class, and I think it is being developed in satellites and such, but I have no clue what it is or how it works.\n\nthere is a wikipedia page, but I don't understand anything.\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay-tolerant_networking)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay-tolerant_networking)","answer":"So, let's say there's a detector out in space that needs to communicate with something on Earth... uh, I dunno, every time it sees an alien.  To do so, it passes the info about the alien down through some satellites, and the satellites can all connect to each other and pass information around, hoping to get the info to the Earth station.  That'll be our network.\n\nIn other types of networks, what happens when you want to send information is that you find a path and then send your info.  The detector would send a \"probing\" signal to a satellite, and the satellite would send out more signals until it could see that it had a path from the detector through the grid of satellites and to the Earth station.  (This is just in case some of the satellites are blocked or busy.)  Once it knew the path, the detector could pass its info down the pathway and to the Earth.\n\nHowever, a lot can go wrong in space!  Since everything is so far apart and there's so much interference, the path that the detector knows about might be broken before the signal gets all the way through.  So what should you do?  You need to come up with a way for the signal to get from the detector to the Earth reliably, even though you know that there will be delays and interruptions.\n\nA common approach would be to have the detector send out info to all available satellites, and make sure that the satellites are storing that info and just passing it on to the next-closest satellite to Earth when they can.   You can't just let it send out the signal and forget about it, because what if you lose the signal?  And then what if it sees another alien in the meantime, too, while it's waiting for the Earth to confirm that it got its first message?  You want the Earth to confirm that it received stuff as well, but the confirmation can also be lost, so you don't want to accidentally count the same alien twice.\n\nSo... yeah!  The exact approach can vary slightly, but the main idea is that you're working under the assumption that the network will drop your signals all over the place.  The network should be able to deal with delays and interruptions in a nice way, even *expect* them."},
{"title":"ELI5: What is earwax? How does it form?","answer":"All parts of your skin (except the palms of your hands and soles of your feet) produce an oil that helps keep your skin from drying out. The inside of your ears do this do. The oil mixes with sweat and dead skin cells to form ear wax.\n\nSounds gross, but it serves a purpose. Like the oil on the rest of your skin, ear wax helps lubricate and insulate your skin. Most importantly though, your ear is warm and moist inside, which makes it a great place for bacteria to grow. Coating your ear canal with a kind of wax prevents bacteria from growing there since most can't eat the ear wax. "},

Student loans I believe are separate from credit (someone confirm this).\n\n&gt;complex version\n\ndebit/atm does nothing for your credit. Credit cards, mortgages, etc affect your credit. Basically credit indicates your ability to pay off debt. People wouldn't want to lend money to someone who couldn't reliably pay off the debt in the past. Basically they use different factors to determine your credit and use it when you request for assistance. I.E. if you default a lot, few people are gonna loan much money to you. If you pay off all your debts in a timely fashion for many years, they'll trust you with a higher loan at a lower interest rate.\n\n&gt;advice\n\nCheck your credit immediately.\n\nIf you aren't rich, I would get a credit card and pay all recurring fees (rent/utility/gas/food) on it. If you feel comfortable and have self restraint, use it for everything, just make sure you pay it off every month. This will build your credit, and when you need to apply for a mortgage, you'll get a much better deal.\n\nThe biggest problem with credit cards, is that people overspend with it, don't pay it off, and get caught with the massive interest."},
{"title":"ELI5 - What is a Fast Fourier Transform? What do you do with it and how does it work? ","answer":"If you drop something into a pool, it makes a wave. If you drop a whole bunch of things at once, you see a whole bunch of waves colliding with each other and interacting in a way that makes it hard to see which waves were caused by which object.\n\nA Fourier transform is a type of mathematical function (one of many transforms!) that essentially splits the complex patterns of overlapping waves into its separate parts.   If you took the pattern of waves on the surface of the pool and applied the Fourier transform, you could tell what object caused what part of the wave.  \n\nNow, waves are important in a whole bunch of areas - sound is made of waves, for instance, and the signals sent to your computer are carried on a frequency wave that needs to be filtered out before you can get useful data out of it.  It's useful to be able to filter out \"junk\" data, and sometimes patterns emerge when you start applying transforms to things.\n\nNow, what makes a Fast Fourier transform (FFT) different from a normal one is... well, basically just that it takes fewer steps for a computer to do.

He usually gives up earlier if someone isn't sure they want lemonade.  \n  \nAlex is a better worker, because he makes more money. Because he earns more, it means he deserves to keep more. Every time Alex tells Bob about how much he made, Bob feels bad. He doesn't realize how much better Alex is. He thinks he's just as good.

If employers benefit from obscure pay scales, this is an unintentional benefit, secondary to maintaining cohesion and morale among the employees.

{"title":"ELI5: Why The Satanic Verses is so controversial","answer":"A good way to think about it is to look at is from a Muslim reader's point of view. The book has some extremely sacrilegious content.  Tons of material that would be offensive can be found throughout the entire novel.  I wrote an essay on this book last year, so here are some specific examples:\n\nThe name of the fictional prophet Mahound (meaning âfalse prophet,â an archaic slur for âMuhammedâ from the Middle Ages).\n\nThe city of Jahilia (meaning ignorance, darkness, also assumed to be used in place of the holy city of Mecca), \n\nSome calling the prophet Abraham a âbastard,â and so on.  \n\nThere is a story in the book about a brothel in Mecca called The Curtain that is a very touchy subject.  The Curtain is a translation of al-hijab, Arabic for the veil used to cover a womanâs face.  The 12 prostitutes in the brothel are named after Mahoundâs twelve wives.  Even worse is how the men who are receiving services form a line that curls âaround the innermost courtyard of the brothel, rotating about its centrally positioned Fountain of Love much as pilgrims rotated for other reasons around the ancient Black Stone.â  Mocking the pilgrimage around the Kaâba, the holiest shrine of Islam, by comparing it to the queue in a brothel is not the best way to earn a lot of Muslim fans.  \n\nWhile the book does contain many offensive parts, a lot of the uproar came from people who hadn't even read the book.  An editor for the   \n*Times of India* wrote after the book was published:\n\n\"You are aggrieved that some of us have condemned you without a hearing, and asked for a ban without reading your book.  I have not read it, nor do I intend to.  I do not have to wade through a filthy drain to know what filth is.\"\n\nBasically, the idea in most Muslim countries was that is was a filthy, blasphemous book and it should be banned (and it was in a lot of countries).\n\nThe books author, Salman Rushdie, was actually forced to go into hiding for over a decade when an official fatwa (an Islamic legal judgement) declared by Ayatollah Khomeini for the death of the author.  The actual text:\n\n\nIn the name of Him, the Highest.  There is only one God, to whom we shall return.  I inform all zealous Muslims of the world that the author of the book entitled The Satanic Verses â which has been compiled, printed, and published in opposition to Islam, the Prophet, and the Qurâan â and all those involved in its publication who were aware of its content, are sentenced to death.\nI call on all zealous Muslims to execute them quickly, wherever they may be found, so that no one else will dare insult the Muslim sanctities.  God willing, whoever is killed on this path is a martyr.\nIn addition, anyone who has access to the author of this book, but does not possess the power to execute him, should report him to the people so that he may be punished for his actions.\nMay peace and the mercy of God and His blessings be with you.\nRuhollah al-Musavi al-Khomeini, 25 Bahman 1367 (27).\n"},

You know on your stereo you can turn the treble and bass up and down? Well, it basically looks at how much treble and bass there is in the song (very precisely - there's a lot more bands than just treble and bass). This is one thing Shazam does when you play it a song. It also works out the tempo of the song by listening for a pulse, and works out what *key* the song is in.\n\nA many other features of the song can be determined from a 10 second clip. Then, once it has these few characteristics, it can search the database for a song at that tempo, in that key and with the same amount of treble and bass, as well as other matching features.\n\nI think Soundhound is even cleverer in some way (I think it also searches a website where people are encouraged to upload a-capella covers of a song, so it can sometimes guess a song just from you humming it), but I could be wrong"},

{"title":"ELI5:  How do Nuclear Inspection Teams expect to find anything in countries that are clearly trying to hide their nuclear goals?","question_detail":"I read in the [news](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/46174915/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa/#.TySBU1y0yHc) today that the UN is sending inspection teams to Iran.  I've long since lost track of how often these teams go to crazy countries and there rarely seems to be any sort of discovery or progress with international relations.  What do these teams do?  What are they hoping to find?  Do they actually have any power?","answer":"They really only have symbolic power in the sense that whatever they do or don't find during an inspection is reported to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the United Nations and made available to various national and international agencies interested in the state of that country's nuclear goals.\n\nThe theory is that any nation with peaceful nuclear goals will be open and willing for the inspection teams to visit and verify their compliance with international regulations concerning nuclear technology development, particularly if they are signatory to the [international nuclear non-proliferation treaty](http://www.un.org/en/conf/npt/2005/npttreaty.html).  The technology required to enrich uranium to a grade required for a power plant is less sophisticated than what is required for a nuclear bomb.  Specifically, bomb-making material needs an extremely high enrichment percentage, something like over 90%.  If any technology indicating a high-enrichment capability is found then that nation can reasonably be seen as having ambitions other than power plant, medical, or other civil use.\n\nThe inspection teams also require to be able to visit any facility at any time, with or without warning.  Should a site be refused entry without a valid reason then circumstantial evidence can point to a \"what have you got to hide\"? rationale.  It may not be direct evidence but the usual public cat-and-mouse accusations and diplomatic posturing and double-talk usually follows for a while before sanctions, bombings, and invasions start."},

I already know what I want my URL to be and I've checked it out and it's unclaimed! :)\n\nMy question is how exactly do I go about doing this? Who owns these 'unowned' domains? How to I register to get it? Where is the best place to host? I know basic web coding but I'm mostly a graphics designer, so I'd probably need something providing a basic template that I could play around with.\n\nSo.... LIF, how do I do this? What's the best company(s) to use?\n\nI'm looking for something reliable, easy to use, and easy to maintain, with good customer service, etc. And due to being a college student, I'm obviously looking for something not on the expensive side of things. I'm not sure if that's asking for too much (considering you typically get what you pay for. Hahahahaha.)","answer":"1. Rent the domain name you're looking to get. A domain registrar such as GoDaddy.com will be able to do this for you. I say rent because you cannot simply buy a domain name, and you typically will rent them for 10 months or a year at a time.\n\n2. Buy hosting for your website, or do it yourself if you're so inclined and have the technology. Again, there are companies for this, and Web Hosting Hub is one such company.\n\nThese next two are interchangeable in sequence.\n\n3/4. Go to your domain registrar and input in their domain management the DNS Servers provided to you by the company which is going to host your website.\n\n3/4. Build a website, or have someone build a website for you. Sometimes a domain registrar will have tools to help you with this, but with a company such as GoDaddy (not necessarily my recommendation, but a suitable example), they charge an extra fee for this feature.\n\n5. Put your website on the hosting company's server, or your own if you went ahead and built that.\n\nAs I said, the companies used here are simply a couple of big names. I do see, however, that Web Hosting Hub has an excellent rating and only charges $3.95. GoDaddy is a common domain registrar, but I'm sure you could find other companies/rates if you concerned yourself to look. I will say that I called their customer support on behalf of my professor, and the tech who spoke to me was immensely helpful in answering the questions I had for him.\n\nBest of luck!"},

{"title":"ELI5 Creative Commons.","answer":"In most countries, any work that is created is automatically copyrighted by the author, even if the author does not explicitly say \"This work is copyrighted by me.\" That means that, by default, you can't copy stuff from other people **unless** they give you permission. It's sort of like if you break into my house, I can have you arrested, and you can't just say \"Aw, but he never *said* I can't go into his house!\" The default stance is you can't go into my house without permission.\n\nCC (Creative Commons) is a way of giving various permissions to people. There are many variants on CC. For example, there's CC-NonCommercial, which basically grants you permission to do whatever you want with the work, except use it in commercial projects. For example, if the work is a song, you can put it on your ipod, you can remix it and make new songs out of it, you can make a movie and use that song as the background music for one of the scenes, etc., as long as you don't make money from any of this. I.e. you'd have to give away your remix for free (not sell it on CDs or in iTunes), you'd have to give away your movie for free, and so on.\n\nAnother is CC-Attribution, which means you can do whatever you want with it, as long as you give credit to the original author. So if I made a movie \"Awesome Movie 4\", and marked it as CC-Attribution, you could then use clips from that movie for your own movie, or use it as the cutscene in a videogame, or whatever, as long as somewhere in the credits you mention \"This game used some scenes from Awesome Movie 4, by Nebu\".\n\nThere are other ways of giving permission than CC. In general, these \"ways\" are called licenses, and some other licenses you may have heard of are GPL, or BSD (thought these are almost always used for programs, and movies, music, etc. typically prefer to use CC rather than GPL or BSD)."},
{"title":"ELI5: How and why certain programming languanges are better suited for doing certain tasks, programs, etc.","question_detail":"Sorry if the question isn't clear. I hear people say things such as \"Java is better for programming a game.\" What is the difference between languages and what makes them better suited for certain situations?","answer":"It's lot like thinking about various tools.  If you need to drive a nail into a wall, a hammer would be a good choice.  If you need to unfasten a nut, then a hammer isn't a good choice.\n\nIt's a bit muddier because almost any language *can* be forced to perform any task, but some are better at certain things than others.\n\nFor example, programming something with a user interface (buttons and stuff to click on) is a lot simpler in Java than it would be in C.  You might write 50 lines of code to do it in Java, and 300 in C.  \n\nHowever, if you need to do something like write a program that looks for large prime numbers, the ability to have a user interface isn't important, but speed is.  So you might choose C over Java, since it is generally faster.  In this case it might be the same *amount* of code in each language, but the C code will run 40% faster.\n\nThe reality is that most languages are like a multitool or Swiss Army knife.  They all have a different selection of tools in them, but you *could* do almost any job with any of them.   \n\nEdit: I made up the numbers in this example, I don't feel like getting into a debate over the relative merits of each language.

But we do know some stuff.\n\nGood article: http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2011/06/static-electricity-how-does-it-work.ars\n\nThe basics is that some materials can get an excess of negatively charged electrons, and some can end up with so few electrons that they will be positively charged (since the atoms' cores have positive charges, most materials usually have a balance so they get a neutral charge). This can happen in many ways, friction is one (electrons are literally knocked off from atoms in one material to the atoms in the other).\n\nWhen two materials come close and there's a high enough difference in charge, they want to even it out. Consider two pools with a pipe between at the bottom and with a valve. Fill one up, then open the valve. They'll even out.\n\nBy comparison, the movement of electrons between materials is called an electrostatic discharge.\n\nNote that it does not have to be between negative and positive charged materials. Charges can go from strongly negative to slightly negatively charged materials, and same goes for positive charges."},

{"title":"What is \"The Gestus\"?","answer":"Gestus is an acting technique of Bertold Brecht. It basically has its roots in the idea that actions do not have meaning outside of their context, and that how someone behaves in a certain situation can tell you more about them, and their society, than their words. \n\nMost often, a theater piece will use gestus to show a character's relationship to their society through an action. It can also be used to express a character's inner emotions. The action itself tends to be overtly dramatic (Brecht was a fan of using unnatural or stylized actions that reminded audiences that they were watching a play, not real life).\n\nThat's kind of vague, so here's an example:\n\n* A woman in a shabby apartment sits on an equally shabby sofa, her landlord bangs on the door and reminds her she is behind on rent. Off stage, a baby starts crying. The woman gives an exaggerated, despairing sigh, rises from the sofa and slouches off towards the crying baby. After a few steps though, she suddenly stops and dramatically turns away from the baby, clenching  jaws and fists. She holds that position for a bit (Achievement Unlocked: GESTUS), before striding back to the sofa. Maybe she grabs a bottle of cheap whiskey along the way.\n\nThis tells us:\n\n* The woman's emotional state: Sad, beaten down, angry\n\n* The woman's feelings towards her child: I fucking hate that fucking baby\n\n* The woman's relationship with her life/society: Her poverty has made her despairing which has made her hate her own child.\n\nIt's really this third part that really makes the gestus significant. Brecht was all about using theater less to entertain, than to make people think about society.\n\nThat's my explanation though. Gestus is one of those terms that everyone seems to have their own definition for. \n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: BRA SIZES","question_detail":"I've always been dumbfounded as to the specifics of bra size classifications, etc. Would one of you wonderful redditors please ELI5? **Please keep it SFW.**","answer":"Bra sizes are typically given as a number-letter pair, e.g. \"32C\". The number refers to the length of the band that goes completely around the torso, while the letter refers to the size of the cups that hold the breasts. \n\nIn North America, the number generally refers to the measurement in inches, while in Japan, the number generally refers to the measurement in centimeters. So a bra that's a 32 in America would be the same size as a bra that's a 81 in Japan, because 32 inches = (approximately) 81 centimeters.\n\nThe letter generally refers to the difference betwee the circumference of the torso when measured at the nipple (or wherever the circumference is biggest), vs the circumference measured just beneath the breast, where it is usually much smaller.\n\nSo for example, an American bra that's a 32A would have a band 32 inches in circumference, and if you measured the circumference at the height of the nipple, you'd measure 33 inches.\n\nMeanwhile, in Japan, a bra that's a 81B would have a circumference of 81 centimeters, and the circumference at the height of the nipple would be 83 centimeters. An American 32A is about the same size as a Japanese 81B.\n\nWhat I said up to now is roughly true, however, unfortunately, some bra manufacturers have added \"double letters\" which breaks the consistency of this system. For example, some bra manufacturers consider A, B, C, D, DD, E, F, etc. to each be 1 unit of length apart in size, so a 32E would have a nipple-circumference of 38 (32 + 6) inches, despite E being the 5th letter of the alphabet, and not the 6th. That same manufacturer might then consider 32F to yield a circumference of 39 (32+7), having only allowed double letters for D. Other manufacturers might allow for double letters at all sizes above D (e.g. A, B, C, D, DD, E, EE, F, FF, etc.)\n\nOther manufacturers use double letters to indicate \"half units\", so a 32CC would have a nipple-circumference of 35.5 inches.\n\nSome manufacturers even include triple letters, and basically you'll have to ask them what exactly that signifies, since there are no universally agreed semantics.\n\nAll in all, it's a big mess, which generally results in you needing to just try on a bra to see if it fits you, given that each manufacturer has its own special rules for sizing. When you hear about someone's bra size, basically all you can infer from is a general approximation of size, but nothing exact."},

How do you get this answer? \n\n2) Also, another question is: answer this if the statement was \"**at least** n of the statements in this list are false\". The answer is statements 1-50 are true, and statements 51-100 are false. Why?\n\nThird part: answer part 2 assuming the list contains 99 statements. The answer i have is that this cannot happen. it is a paradox, showing that there cannot be such statements. How do you know?","answer":"1. Only one of the statements about exactly how many are false can be a true statement (3 can't be false if 5 are false). Since exactly one is true, then 99 are false. That means the one true statement is the 99th statement that \"exactly 99 statements are false\"\n\n2. For \"at least n statements are false\" many statements could possibly be true and many could possibly be false. However, if the first statement \"at least 1 statement is false\" cannot be false, since being false would mean that all the statements are true, but the first one is false by assumption. So the first statement is true.  \nBut now consider the second statement, \"at least 2 statements are false\" if that statement is false that means that only 1 statement is true. We already know statement 1 (above) is true, that means all the remaining statements are false. Well that just means that every statement except for statement 1 is false. But we (by assumption) have at least 2 statements are true. So statement 2 is true.  \nThis continues until we get to 51 (half of 100). At statement 51 we already know that 50 statements are true, so at least 50 statements are true. This means that no more that 50 statements are false. If no more than 50 statements are false than all statements 51-100 have to all be false. \n\n3. If there are only 99 questions, then the sequence of true questions continues to 49 as before, Now at question 50 we know at least 49 questions are true, that means no more than 50 questions are false, but statement 49 is \"at least 49 questions are false\" that means exactly 50 have to be false. So what can question 50 be? \"At least 50 questions are false\" has to be true, but if that statement is true, then the there are at least 50 true questions meaning only 49 were false. So the 99 question case does not work."},

Well what goes up must come down and that has been what is happening to real estate values. \n\nIf you had purchased a house years ago and were planning on selling it between Jan 2008 and now, it is a bad thing because of what H1deki stated, your home is probably worth less than you owe on the mortgage.

Also, long after the original painter died, other people messed around with the painting and added paint and varnish onto the old painting. Modern restoration professionals have techniques for dealing with all of those problems and their goal is to keep the painting from getting worse, to halt the aging process. And to remove old dirt and varnish and even old restoration work done long ago. In the case of really badly deteriorated wood or canvas they can actually remove the paint film off of the old support and glue it back onto a new modern stable wood or canvas support. Mostly though the modern restorers clean. They clean off old layers of varnish and paint that other people added in the past. The cleaning process is where all that chemistry comes into play as they have to use solvents to get the varnish off but not damage the original paint. Occasionally they add paint back onto areas where paint has flaked off, being careful to paint only the missing areas. This gets controversial as there are always cases were the restoration goes too far and the original artists work is altered by the restoration."},

{"title":"ELI5: How do bra cup sizes work?","answer":"Quickquack is sort of right - but this method falls apart very quickly. \n\nThe way you find your bra size is to first determine your breast shape and where your breasts are located on your chest (some women have breasts that are placed much higher or closer together than others) and determine what brand will work best for your shape. Generally this is done by a professional, because without a working knowledge of dozens or hundreds of major brands, it would be very difficult. \n\nNext, you measure your chest (underbust). Depending on the brand, that measurement may be your band size - or you may need to add up to five inches. \n\nKnowing your band size, you can now select your cup size. The best way to do this is generally trial and error. \n\nIt's good to know that cup size is not the same as boob size. You'd think that a woman who's a 36B would have breasts that are the same size as a woman who wears a 32B, and that the latter just has a smaller ribcage. Wrong. Any time you go up a band size, you have to go down a cup size to keep the same \"breast size\" (a measurement that does not actually exist). So a woman with 32DD's has the same size boobs as a woman with 38B's. \n\nThis is based off the American/Euro sizing system. Australia is different and I'm fuzzy on the specifics. \n\nMost brands order their cup sizes something like this (smallest to largest):\n\nAAA\n\nAA\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nDD\n\nE\n\nF\n\nFF\n\nG\n\nH\n\nI\n\nJ\n\nK\n\nKK\n\n\nMost US brands do not carry anything larger than a DD. I'm a 32FF and I have to buy Italian brands. \n\nSource: I've spent way too much time talking to the lingerie girls at Nordstrom. "},
{"title":"ELI5: Mesh Networks","question_detail":"Been seeing a lot of posts about mesh networks in r/darknetplan and I'm still confused.","answer":"You know how when you connect to a wireless network, there's an access point on the other end?  For a large network, like a company over several floors, you might have several access points that are all in range of each other to make sure that you can't go anywhere that isn't covered.  Those access points are all connected to other networked hardware, like a central switch, with wires.\n\nNow you connect to an access point without wires.  Why can't the access points connect to EACH OTHER without wires?  They can't because the original language they use to talk to each other didn't have any way for them to do that. But some people added extensions to the language, kind of like adding new words, that allowed the access points to do that.\n\nIt's a little more complicated than that: there are several ways to make them do it (WDS, where a single access point can talk to others without interrupting its existing service, or simply uplinking to other APs as a client).  Also, there's only so much bandwidth you can get out of a band.  "},
{"title":"Eli5: how does voice recognition software work?","answer":"It records the speech into waves then breaks the sounds up into individual components called phonemes. Kinda like letters of the alphabet but with some overlap for things that sound the same like f and ph.

How do they get access to the ability to generate unlock codes, and why doesn't someone just offer the generator for free already?","answer":"All legal unlock methods (the kind that don't void your warranty) are straight from the manufacturer. The manufacturer of your phone keeps a large private database, and each phone has a unique unlock code. A reseller pays the manufacturer money to be able to search this database. \n\nThere is no generator, as they are unique to YOUR phone. Every phone has a unique code, called the IMEI, that is entered while running the search for the unlock code. \n\nThere are several other ways to unlock your phone, such as a SIM hack, which is a thin circuit board, between the SIM card and the phone contacts, that can be used to emulate a carrier's SIM format.\n\nAs an aside, unlock codes are usually not avail for hot, brand new phones, because the phone usually has a 3 month or so exclusivity contract with a certain carrier, and they get a lot of money to keep it that way.

You jerk off a guy to your right, and he does a guy to his right, and he... yadda yadda all the back until the guy to your left is jerking you.\n\nThe joke is that a 'circlejerk' is an event or a place where people always agree with each other because they share the same views on nearly every subject.

{"title":"Superbowl is on. ELI5 why there are a hundred players on each team","question_detail":"edit: thanks all. \"a hundred players\" was intentional hyperbole, i think most people grasped that. I grew up playing rugby so that's where this question stems from. I could have made it about the comparative skills range but one quickly realises its apples and oranges. American football is its own game. I was more curious as to development of the specialisation, it kind of seems unique in world sport. There are positives and negatives, but can definitely appreciate the emphasis on strategy. I just can't help myself thinking, anytime the QB is waiting too long in the pocket for a receiver my rugby brain just yells \"go yourself son!\" but they never do. but yeah QBs are playmakers, prone to injury, etc etc","answer":"Rules, money and unions.\n\nFootball doesn't flow continuously like rugby, and allows unlimited substitutions.  This lends itself to specialization, as it is a lot easier to adapt personal to a situation that will only last a few seconds.  Rugby favors more all around ability.\n\nAlso, the top rugby players make about 250,000 pounds a year.  That is pretty close to the *minimum* of what an NFL player makes...average salaries are well over $1 million.  At rugby levels of competition, it is still possible to be an athletic all arounder, getting by on talent more than skill.  NFL level competition requires both talent *and* skill, and with skill comes specialization.\n\nFinally, the NFL has a strong union, and more roster spots means more job security.  In the early days, rosters were as small as 16 players, but there has been a general upward trend every since."},

{"title":"ELI5: How do people get convicted of statutory rape?","question_detail":"I understand how people get accused of real rape, because real rape involves physical force and forced penetration which usually provides hard evidence. Statutory rape is consentual with no force, but with someone under the age of consent.  It seems like most of the time people get accused and even convicted because an underage person or their parents and come forth saying that their son or daughter had sex with them. So how do they get proof? I don't think sperm testing would work because they usually get accused a while after the alleged sex happens, and by that time the sperm should be out of the girl, and I think they use condoms to.\n\nSo do statutory rapist get convicted on pure hearsay, or is there more to it?\nIf it is based on all hearsay that's fucked up, because real rapist get off all the time due to lack of physical evidence, but say a 19 y/o has sex with a 16-17 y/o, they go to prison for years.\n\nBtw, I'm not a statutory rapist. I'm just curious because I hear a lot about these cases, and I'm curious on how people get convicted of it. And why conviction of real rapists are seemingly less common than statutory rapists.","answer":"First, hearsay is not what you think it is. I would recommend another ELI5 for that, if you want to learn more.\n\nSecond, \"statutory rape\" is a \"strict liability\" crime, meaning: you do not need the mental presence to commit the crime. I am not talking about sanity vs. insanity, I am talking about the accused's knowledge of the age of the partner - the actual knowledge of the elements of the crime.\n\nNow, most statutory rape statutes make it a crime to engage in intercourse (even with consent) with an underage partner. And in trial (if there even is one), hearsay will never be allowed (barring very few exceptions to that rule).\n\nThe evidence of the crime will have to be declaratory (testimony), physical (semen, clothing, etc.), demonstrative (think reenactments), or stipulations (each side agrees to something). THAT IS IT.\n\nJust like any other criminal proceeding, the prosecution has to convince a jury (or judge for a bench trial) that the accused has committed the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThere is no trick here. Without strong physical evidence, it will be a lot of \"he said, she said\" and circumstantial evidence, which is true for almost any criminal trial.\n\nIn the end, the jury will believe who they want to believe."},
{"title":"ELI5 how skin can be \"dry\" or \"moisturized\", and why pouring water on it doesn't help.","question_detail":"Also, is this related to chapped lips?","answer":"Your skin has glands that produce oil, just like it has glands that produce sweat. This oil, called sebum, is what \"moisturizes\" your skin. What it actually does is prevent water from inside you body from evaporating out quickly, while also lubricating the skin to prevent cracking and tearing. Skin lotions/moisturizers all mimic this natural effect. \n\nJust pouring water on wouldn't help (it could even hurt, by stripping away more of the oil), because the protective coating is an oil. Drinking water and staying hydrated in other ways can help replenish the water your body is constantly losing. Water loss through the skin (if you're not sweating) is actually somewhat small though.\n\nCracking and tearing of skin is basically what chapped lips actually are. Not only is the skin on our lips some of the thinnest on our body, but it also lacks the glands that produce sebum. The lips do get some protection from the glands in the surrounding skin, but not a lot. The thin skin combined with a weak protective coating causes the lips to dry out more frequently. In cold air (which is naturally drier than warm air), the lips dry out faster than our body can compensate, thus giving you chapped lips. \n\nThis is why people use chapstick, which is basically just wax, it mimics the effect of the body's natural oils by trapping moisture. Any fat would work though. The Inuit -- who know a thing or two about cold weather -- traditionally smeared their lips with whale or seal blubber.\n\nFUN FACT: As skin dries out, it flakes. This is what causes Black people to appear \"ashy.\" White people get ashy too, but, since they're already white, it's less noticeable.\n\n"},

There is some push towards renewable energy, but on the whole it seems like gas prices don't get very high. It seems like we are working our way towards an absolute shock when the oil is gone...\n\nWater - Ok, so I live in Michigan and one of the books we had to read was \"The Great Lakes Water Wars\" which goes into great depths talking about the legislation around the Great Lakes as well as the disappearing water supplies for (mainly) the western arid states. There is going to come a time when these states are completely without drinking water, and many projections say that that time will come within a decade. I don't understand how we can continue to operate without having a viable plan to counter this problem that WILL arise, we just are not sure when.","answer":"I wouldn't say we're ignoring the problems, but we haven't found solutions that please everyone and we can't be sure that these solutions will actually work. I have my own interests and idea of the way things should be done. You have your own interest and ideas about life. So we can't agree on a solution that will please both of us. So from an outsider's perspective it can look like the problems are being ignored.\n\nLet's take oil. Despite the environmental and social costs of it, we still need it. Our society would collapse if oil was gone tomorrow. And renewable technology has not proven to work as efficiently and cheaply as oil yet. So even though renewable energy has proven to have benefits, oil is way cheaper to use. At present, we simply do not have the technology to maximize the potential of renewable energy. We might develop this technology but we might not. \n\nSo it would be incredibly shortsighted to say \"Fuck oil and let's put all our money in green technology.\" The oil industry would oppose this because of personal interests. And despite how greedy they may seem, we as a society cannot let oil companies simply collapse. There are jobs and a lot of tax revenue at stake. Not to mention, other countries (especially poorer ones) still need that oil and do not have the resources to develop green technology.\n\nBut say we did put all our money into green technology. We put billions of dollars into it. Even though scientists make modest gains we realize that we are still decades away from making renewable energy as efficient and cheap as oil. People would've demanded results for that money and would be pretty pissed that all their contributions resulted in nothing. We'd probably say \"Yeah, we should've thought that through.\"\n\nMy final point is that in order to solve our problems, we need to solve them incrementally.

As the_skittish noted, http://www.headphone.com/ is a fantastic site to research on. A frequently useful term is frequency response. Sound is a wave and has an amplitude (how tall the wave is which is the sound's volume) and a frequency (how close together the peaks are, which is how high the pitch is). Now, when your headphones get fed input, you want it to relay that input through the speakers just as they came in for pure sound, however, this depends on the frequency response. You usually see a graph which shows the frequency response and you can see where some frequencies end up being relayed slightly better than others do (cheap headphones will have much better response in the high end normally and not in the low end, meaning they don't give you a lot of bass, even though that bass is in the song you're listening to).  \n\n[Here](http://www.ecoustics.com/electronics/products/articles/131063.jpg) is a good picture of an example curve from an [article](http://www.ecoustics.com/electronics/products/articles/131062.html) about frequency response. You can see that the response drops radically in the extremes and is slightly uneven in the middle.

If you know what people did to get where they are, because you did it too, then you respect them and trust them just a bit more.

{"title":"ELI5: What constitutes racism?","question_detail":"People always tell me that itâs not racist to make wholesale negative remarks about white people because they are in the majority and therefore âin powerâ. \nSo, doesn't that mean the idea is that you can only be a racist if you are in a position to oppress someone?\n\nI remember someone was throwing a bitchfit online about how you can't be racist to a white person. \nI always thought that racism was discrimination of a race. \n\n\nedit: If anyone can explain to me why there are others who think it's not possible to be racist to a white person, please do! Thanks.","answer":"There are two somewhat common definitions for racism.\n\n1) Attribution (positive or negative) of certain traits to an individual because of his/her identification with an ethnic or racial group.\n\nExample: I see an Asian walking down the street and without ever interacting with them, assume that they are good at math or bad at driving.\n\n2) The use of power (political, economic, social, etc.) to discriminate against an individual because of his/her identification with an ethnic or racial group. Using this definition, racism is prejudice plus power.\n\nExample: A white person dislikes Black people and uses their power to oppress (prevent them from being hired, getting an apartment, admission to a university, etc)\n\nUsing the second definition, some believe that minorities cannot be racist towards Whites because they do not have power over them. Though I find this either underestimates the power non-Whites have or ignores the detriment supposedly positive attributions can have when falsely delegated to a certain group. \n\nTo continue one of my examples above, say there is an Asian that is not great at math. Due to the widespread *understanding* of Asians being good at math, he is seen as an outsider when within a group of other Asians that know about his subpar skills. He has also ostracized by non-Asians, who have run into a person that doesn't reinforce their preconceived perceptions on how Asians act.\n"},
{"title":"ELI5: interest on loads of cash","question_detail":"Posts about winning lotteries are fairly frequent, like this recent one:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pjmwf/the_powerball_is_at_over_300_million_what_would/\nb1ackcat said the interest on $300 million would be $12 million a year, or $10 million with tax. Theoretically that works, but are there banks that offer a single account with an upper limit of hundreds of millions of $ and a decent interest rate? Surely you'd have to split your $ into several smaller accounts, giving you less interest? Also, surely inflation would mean you were constantly losing $, making interest pretty much pointless?\n\nEdit: So, thanks for your answers. Now I understand what being rich is like!","answer":"I'm so honored that someone mentioned me in a post! hah. I love this site too much.\n\nMy comment was a HUGE over-simplification for the sake of demonstrating how absurdly large of a number $300,000,000 is. dbe is correct, if you take the lump sum (which generally, you should do if you plan on investing the money, as you'll make more in the long run than you would with an annuity), you'll only get around half as much money. Depends on the lottery rules and the state laws.\n\nThen that gets taxed. Heavily, because it's free money, and what right do you have to bitch about it?\n\nSo now you have, say, 125 million dollars. In my example, I said to put it into some index funds and let it sit. Index funds follow the market, which historically, over the long term, puts out around 10% interest. I said 4% to show that even with bad returns, you'd still make a large amount of money.\n\ndbe is also right in that you wouldn't use a savings account for this type of thing. I don't know what upper limits most banks put on a bank account, but I would assume that if there is one, it's at $250,000, as that's the maximum amount that money in savings accounts is insured for through FDIC. If your bank goes under, you're guaranteed to not lose that money, up to 250000\n\nWhat you would do is take all your money to some CPA or an investment firm such as Fidelity, or TIAA Cref, etc. And speak with them. They'll help you set up a set of accounts that you'll divide your money into. None of those accounts have a set interest rate, like a savings account does. They're tied to the stock market, or to the housing market, or to government bonds, or some other thing that has the POTENTIAL to give interest. Most of the time, that potential is pretty high, otherwise no one would ever invest there. However, with the market being what it is these days, there are some months where you could actually LOSE some of your starting money. Historically, though, you can bet you'll eventually make it back.\n\ntl:dr; thanks for the nod. I was exaggerating. Dont use a savings account. use investments."},
{"title":"ELI5 the difference between Electric Potential and the Electric Field.","question_detail":"Thanks.","answer":"The electric field is the negative of the gradient of the potential. That is, if there's more potential at one point than another, there will be a field between the points from high to low potential. This field will cause a force on a particle equal to the field times the charge of the particle, (positive charges will go with the field, negative particles go against it). \n\nThe potential difference of two points is a measure of how much energy you get from moving 1 unit of charge from one point to the other. The potential is a scalar, not a vector, because it has no direction (and it has units of energy/charge, and neither of those have direction).\n\n"},

The cat scenario was not meant to reflect reality, but was instead intended to show just how weird quantum mechanics are.  To make a long story short, at very, very, very small sizes, a particle can exist in multiple states at the same time (both stable and decayed, for instance).  It's only after you check the particle's state that it is committed to a single state.  To show how ridiculous this was, Schrodinger described a cat existing as both dead and alive (2 states) until it was observed.\n\nTL;DR: Use the search bar in the top-right corner.  "},

{"title":"ELI5: Why two eyes are needed for depth perception","question_detail":"Two eyes placed right next to each other does seem like a waste. Apparently this is a good thing, as it is necessary for depth perception. But why? If I'm not mistaken, the eye does adjust the lens to focus on whatever I'm looking at. Why can't it just tell the brain how far away whatever I'm looking at is? And if it does (I reckon it does, as the brain has to tell the eye how to focus, right?), why isn't this sufficient information? Why do I need both eyes?","answer":"I'm disappointed, Reddit. Lots of detailed explanation presented in a manner that fits in this subreddit, and you're getting it wrong.\n\nOP: Two eyes are not necessary for depth perception. Your brain figures out depth with a variety of methods. Some of them are two-eye (binocular) cues, while the majority of them are one-eye (monocular) cues.\n\nYou can test this out for yourself. Close one of your eyes. Can you tell the difference in depth between your hand in front of your face and your (presumably farther) computer screen? You sure can!\n\nMost of your depth perception cues come from telling the difference between different objects. A lot of information comes from the way things are moving in relation to others, and that can information can easily come from single-eye observation. We make even greater use of this than we would consciously, because our eyes are constantly making tiny movements of which we're not generally aware.\n\nOne-eye (monocular) cues: Motion parallax, depth from motion, perspective, relative size, familiar size, aerial perspective, accommodation, occlusion, curvilinear perspective, texture gradient, lighting/shading, defocus blur.\n\nTwo-eye (binocular) cues: Stereopsis, convergence, shadow stereopsis.\n\n**TL;DR: We do not need two eyes for depth perception. One eye is plenty good because your brain adjusts for other factors, even though two eyes are better.**\n\nEdit for source: I remembered this from my psych classes, but here is the Wiki article from which I pillaged the names of all the different types of cues.

{"title":"ELI5: The Argument of \"Separation of Church and State\" and \"Under God\" in the Pledge","question_detail":"So I viewed the recent posting of another attempt at removing \"Under God\" from the Pledge of Allegiance - http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/pnm50/an_anonymous_family_from_my_hometown_is_taking/ . This made me want to look up the previous failed attempts at removing \"Under God\" from the Pledge, and why the ruling was of course in support of the terminology. The most recent case I found was in 2006 - http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/12/under-god-in-pledge-of-allegiance_n_496255.html . Which essentially says the Supreme Court didn't want to rule on it because: \"[he] lacked the legal standing to file the suit because he didn't have custody of his daughter, on whose behalf he brought the case.\" So the attempt rightly failed due to a technicality.\n\nI got discussing with my brother who just recently finished law school and his initial argument is that the Pledge of Allegiance is not actually a \"law\" and therefore can endorse any \"religion\" deemed appropriate. Hence they can put \"In God We Trust\" on the back of dollar bills, add the 10 Commandments to Courthouses, etc. I tried to look up to see if it is officially included in any U.S. law and found that it has been officially adopted by Congress and is a United States Code in 1942 - http://www.usflag.org/uscode36.html . But then of course later switched in 1954 to include \"Under God\". What I don't understand is the support or impact a U.S. Code has on national law. \n\nAnother, although less complex, response was that \"God\" in the Pledge could mean any religion... not just in the Christian sense. Which I believe is incorrect, which is why they didn't make it \"god\", \"Allah\", or \"Yahweh\". But of course I may be completely incorrect. \n\nPlease clear up what is officially law, which can be enforced - as well as the context in which \"Under God\" was added. ","answer":"Atheist here, and I just want to add my 2 cents.  I loathe the Pledge  of Allegiance.  Not because there is a reference to a mythical god, but because the pledge is to the flag.  The flag by itself means nothing.  All nations have flags, most aren't worth living in.  I would be much more  enthusiastic about a Pledge of Allegiance to the Bill of Rights.  Fuck the flag.  Congress could pass a law tomorrow changing the flag entirely and we are still in the same great country.  On the other hand, if congress would pass a law (amendment) that strips away our freedoms enshrined in the Bill of Rights, and we might as well call ourselves North Korea.\n\nAnd to those who might say shame on me, brave men and women died for that flag, I reply, they died for our freedoms which are protected by the Bill, not some piece of cloth.\n\nJust my opinion."},

He's a hawk in all senses of that term: super aggressive and all. \n\nPreviously, Truman had been following the policy of containment. The architect of containment, George Kennan,  was an Ambassador to the USSR I think, and also Acheson's arch-rival. He was pretty much a dove. He said not to fight the Commies where they had already taken root, but simply to prevent Communism from spreading into other countries. It was quite a passive policy.\n\nNSC-68 was completely different. It said that the USSR was never going to stop at world domination. There's no way you can \"contain\" them or negotiate with them. It said that war with them was inevitable and recommended  stockpiling weapons like crazy, so if the USSR bombed the US, the navy could hide in the ocean and bomb them right back as a MAD situation (mutually assured destruction).

{"title":"ELI5: The United States motivations/reasons for going to war with vietnam","question_detail":"I was born in '84 and never had grasp (in my adult life) of why this war occurred","answer":"If you want a very short, very simple explanation...\n\nFrom the 1940s until the early 1990s, there was a state of 'cold war' between the capitalist societies and the communist societies. Most of the capitalist societies -- USA, UK, France, West Germany, Australia, etc -- were good buddies with each other, and most of the communist societies -- Russia, East Germany, China -- were good buddies with each other. It was called 'cold war' because while there was never outright combat between the major powers, they were very clearly enemies. \n\nFrance had control over Vietnam, which they named French Indochina, from the mid-1800s until the Battle of France in 1940, when the Germans occupied France. Germany hands off French Indochina to its buddy Japan. Japan does some terrible things and drives the country into a disastrous famine. Lots of people in French Indochina/Vietnam are sick and tired of being colonised by other countries that just mess everything up, and they start to form communist revolutionary groups with the aim of overthrowing the Japanese and becoming independent. In 1945, WW2 ends when Japan is defeated. China helps drive out Japan in the north, and Britain helps drive out Japan in the south. This furthers a divide between the north and south politically -- the French were always concentrated in the south, so there's a lot of French influence there, and now Britain is their saviour, so there's pro-Western sentiment, whereas in the North, the Chinese communists are there hero, and thus more pro-communist sentiment. There is a lot of fighting between France and people loyal to France, who are trying to get things back to the way they were, and the new communist revolutionary groups. After 10 years, it is agreed to divide Vietnam at the center, giving the north to the communists and the south to the loyalists, France itself having control over neither. \n\nBoth sides have a lot of problems. The north develops a famine, and the south is filled with furious unrest and protests. The American CIA back an assassination of the south's president. Then there's a chaotic power struggle over the leadership with lots of coups and assassinations that just weaken the country and turn it into a disaster before it eventually becomes a dictatorship. Meanwhile the north, which believes that it should have control over the entire former-French-Indochina, sees a sitting duck and starts attacking. America and other first-world countries think \"Oh snap, if the communists take over the south, that's one less country on our side, and one more country helping our enemies!\". There is a popular idea called domino theory, which holds that communism spreads to its neighbours -- after all, China's communism spread to Vietnam, Russia's communism spread to Eastern Europe, and so on. The West wants desperately to stop that spread, and thus gets involved in Vietnam to protect a capitalist, pro-Western regime.\n\nThey failed, and Vietnam unified as a communist nation. But, as most communist nations did, they drastically lessened their devotion to collectivisation and Marxism during the 85-95 period, and are doing a lot better today as a result."},

{"title":"How do schools justify limiting free speech?","question_detail":"I know there have been tons of supreme court cases with students suing their schools because they violate free speech, but the schools always win. How do they keep winning?","answer":"It's about competing interests and competing rights.  Schools cannot control a student's speech (for the most part) outside of school.  But when speech within school disrupts the school's functionality, there is a competing interest.  This is based on reasonableness in reaction to speech.  For instance, if you come into a school wearing a shirt that says \"I have a bomb strapped to my chest,\" yes that is speech, you haven't \"done\" anything other than put a statement on your shirt.  If you do this, you will be promptly arrested, searched by dogs, and the school will be evacuated.  If a school couldn't place reasonable restrictions on what students wear and say, the school would risk not functioning.  There is a balance here, and certainly schools overstep and do lose court cases, but that is the rationale.  "},

You don't even notice mass until you have something huge like a moon.\n\nSo while spinning a marble will not have anywhere close to a noticeable affect on its mass, spinning a planet certainly will."},
{"title":"ELI5 the difference between feminism and humanism.","answer":"Humanism refers to philosophies that focus on humanity and human notions as opposed to philosophies that focus on divinity and spiritual or supernatural notions. Somebody who calls themselves a humanist is saying \"my worldview is based on reason and human ethics in this real world\". It doesn't refer to any specific beliefs beyond that and there are a wide variety of different ideas and philosophies that are humanistic, the most famous of which is probably existentialism. Humanist philosophy is typically, but not inherently, irreligious. Humanist religious beliefs tend to hold that gods are not the focus of all life, but that whatever gods there may be intend for humans to live their lives on their own without having to worship them.\n\nFeminism is a catch-all term for social movements with the goal of changing public attitudes towards gender. In the Western world it is typically divided into three 'waves' or generations; the first concerned with procuring voting, property, and financial independence rights for women, the second concerned with changing attitudes about work and home life (women should not have careers, men should not be nurses or teachers, women should not masturbate or enjoy sex, etc), and the third and current one. In the modern era it's less focused on women's issues and more blended with LGBT and mental health movements (gay marriage, domestic abuse, family law, etc) as well as women's legal rights in foreign countries (particularly China and the Middle East).\n\nThere is no connection between the two."},

{"title":"ELI5: How microwaves work.","question_detail":"I wonder.\n\nAs I heat my Chinese Food.\n\nalso, Why does it make things like bread all flimsy?","answer":"There are two types of charge: Positive and negative. Water particles are made up of positive charge on one side, negative charge on the other side.\n\nAn electric field is a force field that points in one direction and acts on electric charges. Positive charges are pulled in that direction, negative charges move in the opposite direction. Put a water particle in an electric field, and its positive charge will move in the direction of the electric field, while its negative charge moves in the opposite direction. But because these charges are connected to each other, the whole particle stays in the same position, with each charge pulling it one direction.\n\nIn a microwave, the basic idea is that you turn on an electric field, then change its direction, and do that over and over and over again, really really fast. This causes the water particle to align with the field, then spin around to re-align itself when you change the electric field's direction. This happens over and over and over, and the water particle is suddenly spinning around really fast. Moving particles are heat. QED."},
{"title":"ELIF: Why the US is in so much debt when our GDP is so high","answer":"Debt and Deficit are different (and the comments here are confusing them).\n\nDebt is something you will pay back later.  Deficit is having too many bills and not enough money to pay them.  So the other comments are actually talking about deficit.  For example, a government budget deficit would mean the government can't pay for everything it needs to, like schools, the military, medicare, etc.\n\nBut you're asking about debt.\n\nDebt means you got money, but you have an obligation to pay it back later.  An example is US Treasury Bonds.  Say you give the govt $50.  They give you a bond.  And in 10 years, you can turn that particular bond back in and they give you $100.  By taking your money and giving you a bond, the govt can get money for whatever project they want to do.  But you get a nice return on your money for your trouble.\n\nSo those bonds can be bought and traded around the world.  And if the govt needs more money for, say, a war?  They can sell more bonds.  And in general, this isn't a bad thing at all.  The more people lend to the country, the lower all our interest rates are.  This helps people start new businesses and buy homes.\n\nThe wars in the middle east did increase our debt, and so did the bailouts.  But a much larger force in our debt has been China.\n\nFor many many years, China has been forcing their currency to be weak so that other countries (mostly US) buy their cheap goods.  They can beat everyone else on price.  So they sell tons and tons of stuff.  Normally, that would make their currency strong.  They avoid that by taking their profits and buying up US bonds.  The Chinese National Bank stockpiles them.\n\nSo by keeping their currency low, they beat everyone on price.  Factories move to China, manufacturing jobs move to China, and they finance our debt to we can keep buying more of their stuff!  This is the Chinese-American Debt Loop.  China started it many years ago to get their country industrialized and on its feet, but now we're both stuck.  It's been going on for a long time, and both countries are pretty locked in."},

{"title":"ELI5 Computer kernels, and why Linux's kernel is \"better\" than other OS's","answer":"I don't think anyone explained what an operating system kernel is very well yet.\n\nFirst of all, let's consider the difference between hardware and software. Hardware is the physical computer itself. What's amazing about computers, compared to simpler machines like automobiles, refrigerators, or dishwashers, is that a computer doesn't just do one thing, it can do *anything* you program it to do. Software is the instructions you give to a computer to make it do things. That includes the operating system (and kernel), which is usually used to get the computer started, and then specific applications you want to run.\n\nOK, so what about a kernel? Hang on, we'll get there...\n\nA computer does *not* need an operating system! You can program a computer that runs software directly to do one task. If you have a very, very simple computer - for example, a tiny computer that's embedded inside some larger machine, like the computer inside your car's engine - then sometimes it makes sense to not have an operating system.\n\nHowever, as a computer gets more complicated - like think of a modern computer with lots of inputs (keyboard, mouse, network, scanner, cd-rom, usb drives) and outputs (display/monitor, audio/sound, printer, network, cd burner, etc.), it becomes a ton of work to try to write the software that works with all of these inputs and outputs to do something useful!\n\nThat's where the operating system comes in. The operating system is software that handles all of the generic part of being a computer - the thing that's common to just about every computer, no matter what task you want to do with it. Every computer should be able to access files on a disk. Every computer should be able to access the Internet. Every computer should be able to listen to a keyboard and display pictures on a monitor. Every computer should let you run multiple programs at once and switch between then. Every computer should provide a way to back up and restore all of your data. All of the software to make this possible is part of the operating system, so that a computer for word processing can also be a computer for browsing the web and a computer for composing music - they're all different applications, but they all need the same core capabilities.\n\nOK, so what about a kernel? Now we can bring that in.\n\nThe kernel is the core non-optional part of the operating system - the part that handles interacting with all of the hardware connected to your computer, like disks, memory, keyboards, monitors, etc. It manages all of these devices and communication between them. It also sets up rules for other applications that want to run and facilitates communication between these applications and the devices.\n\nSo what is part of the operating system but NOT the kernel?\n\nEverything optional / customizable. For example, the exact graphical look. Or particular keys that switch programs. Or control panels that let you adjust the volume. All of these things are considered part of the operating system, but not the kernel.\n\nFor example, Android and iOS have very similar kernels - Linux and Mach/BSD are about equally capable overall, and share a lot of design in common. However, the Android and iOS operating systems are in just about every other way totally different.\n\nThe Windows and Mac kernels are not nearly as similar. So in that case, both the operating systems and the kernels are all different.\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: how is printing money not stealing?","question_detail":"I understand (or think I do) that money is a unit of exchange that represents value (e.g. bread).  In my (maybe naÃ¯ve) view of how things *should* be, there would just be a fixed amount of money, forever.\n\nOne way of making the amount of money fixed would be to use something there is a limited amount of, like gold.  I thought that coins/notes basically represented gold somewhere because we didn't want to carry gold everywhere.  However, I'm told that we no longer use a gold currency, so *money can be printed with no effort* â¦\n\nâ¦ This seems crazy! Doesn't this mean that the printers (governments..?) can just print themselves money?  How does this not steal value from whatever money I own?  When they print more money, where does it go?  They don't give it to me â¦ or do they?\n\n*Why and how did this happen?!*  It seems like a massive step backwards and makes nonsense of how I thought capitalism worked.  Why did people start accepting some currency the other person could just print more of; isn't this really stupid?","answer":"When the government prints more money, it usually increases the money supply (some money is lost or destroyed, though) and this decreases the value of currency already in circulation.  That's inflation and yes, it does take your savings away.  \n\nHowever, you need to consider some of the positive effects of that!  One is that it encourages people not to save their money.  That's a good thing for the economy - money tucked away in a mattress does nobody any good.  Money that is invested in a loan earns you interest (that keeps up with inflation) but also enables someone else to buy a house or start a business - helping to kick-start the economy.  Money that you spend goes to paying salaries and helping other people afford to buy things - again, kick-starting the economy.  So the country as a whole does better when people choose to spend or invest their money.  \n\nAnother issue is that the country isn't going to suffer shocks to its currency as gold is discovered or as hard currency leaves the country - it can control the money supply (and combat deflation, when it happens).  \n\nA third issue is that the country can choose to print money instead of raising taxes.  Most people get upset when the hear the government is raising taxes, but rarely care when they hear about interest rates rising.  \n\nKeep in mind the goal of most central banks is to keep inflation within a manageable number, typically 1-2%.  The government doesn't want high inflation, but nor do they want zero inflation - because deflation is a damaging problem that is hard to undo.  \n\nAs for when - transforming from a gold or silver standard to a fiat currency has happened throughout the 19th and 20th centuries around the world, until today when every currency I am aware of is a fiat currency.  It gives the government more tools for economic control, makes bank bankruptcies less common, and discourages deflation.  "},
{"title":"ELI5: Israeli/Palestine Conflict? ","answer":"Basically, there is a piece of land in the middle east that has been controlled by a whole [bunch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine#Overview) of different empires/countries throughout its history.  Both Arabs and Jews were former owners.  For centuries, the Jews maintained a significant presence in the region.  The land always had a religious significance to the Jews, as well as the Christians, and Muslims.  \n\nThroughout the Jews' history, they had faced issues of discrimination all over the world, so an idea known as Zionism developed, which basically refers to the idea that the Jews should get their own country.  Plans for this began at the end of the 19th century.  (A lot of people on Reddit seem to think it started following the Holocaust, but the fact is that Theodor Herzl, the main figure associated with Zionism, died in 1904.)  There were plans developed to get Jews a homeland in some pretty random places, such as [Uganda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Uganda_Program), but those plans were rejected.  Following WWII and the Holocaust, the Jews were finally given some territory in the British Mandate of Palestine, with help from the UN and Britain.  The land was divided between the Israelis and the Palestinians so although the people living in the mandated land were 2/3 Arabs, Jews made up a majority of 60% in the land they received.  \n\nThis raised a whole bunch of issues.  The Jews saw the land as historically and rightfully theirs.  The Palestinians saw the Jews as foreign occupiers.  Neighboring Arabs saw Israel as easily conquerable land.  This culminated in a war the day Israel declared independence.  And, to make a tremendously long story short, there have been plenty of wars since then.  The main issues relate to rightful ownership of the land, religious differences, and each side's perceived mistreatment by the opposition. "},

Why wouldn't/can't the video just be processed by the CPU, which typically has a MUCH higher clock speed?","answer":"In all but the simplest machines, you need some sort of dedicated hardware to handle drawing graphics on the machine.  It might be a frame buffer, it might support sprites but for a long time they were all pretty dumb - the CPU would write graphics to an area of memory &amp; the graphics controller would put it on the screen.  Some machines this was wired into the system, in others it was a separate component of a modular architecture - how it's integrated is not relevant.\n\nSomewhere along the way, people started making graphics controllers that could simplify some tasks - like moving a window across the screen without having to redraw **everything**.  This allowed more of the CPU to be used to do actual work, rather than spend all it's time drawing stuff on a screen.  Keep in mind that a 1024x768 screen refreshing at 60Hz is 47,185,920 pixels - that's a lot of busy work.\n\nThis carried along for a while until the advent of the 3D graphics card - at first, they were simple things that could *only* do 3D in games (talking consumer grade parts here, not workstation hardware) and still needed a \"regular\" card to do 2D graphics.  Since then, they've gotten better &amp; faster every year - their improvements far outstripping those made with general purpose CPUs.\n\nYou originally asked why this is the case - put quite simply, there are some problems that can easily be broken into a lot of parts and done at the same time &amp; some that can't.  There's a saying, \"nine women can't make a baby in a month\".  Mathematically, you can prove that *most* computational problems can't be \"parallelized\" - this is why Intel's current top of the line only has 6 cores (parts of the CPU can simultaneously solve a problem).  Graphics processing, however, is one of the areas that is *really easy* to do in parallel &amp; it's really easy to stick a whole bunch of \"simple\" graphics processing cores onto a single chip.  The current top of the line nVidia card has 1024 cores working in parallel. That's 170 times the processing units of our CPU!\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: How do batteries work?","question_detail":"Just realized today that I really have no idea...","answer":"Interesting bit of trivia: for metal plates in water, the \"reactions\" are basically corrosion.  The water attacks the metal surface and starts dissolving it very rapidly.  It's basically the same as with salt: the water atoms surround each metal atom and pull it off the surface.  But as each metal atom is yanked away, it leaves behind its outer electrons.  They stay behind in the metal.  In other words, positively-charged atoms (ions) are pulled out of the metal and into the water, while the metal gets charged up negative.  The metal has excess electrons, while the water (a conductor itself) charges up positively.   But then the corrosion suddenly halts.  It halts because the positive metal ions get repelled by the strongly positive water, and they're forced back, attracted back into the strongly negative metal.  No longer can they move out of the metal.  Everything then remains balanced, and the charged water and metal will prevent further corrosion.\n\nIn other words, metals should dissolve almost as fast as salt crystals in water, but this \"static electricity\" charging effect stops the corrosion.  The metal just sits there in the water, permanently charged up to a few volts negative.\n\nIf you could eliminate that voltage, the metal would dissolve rapidly.  What if you could *increase* the level of the negative charge?  That would attract any positive metal atoms in the water back onto the metal surface.  That's called \"electroplating.\"\n\nA battery is made whenever you put two kinds of metal into the same pool of water.  The atoms of different metals are bound together with differing forces.  This means that, when the water corrodes the different metals, they charge up to different levels of voltage before the process finally grinds to a halt.  Stick some copper and zinc into water, and the zinc will charge up to a higher negative voltage than the copper.  The water is positive  ...but the zinc is negative in relation to the copper.\n\nWhat if you then let the copper touch the zinc?  The surface forces of the two metals fight each other.  Zinc loses, since its higher negative charge is getting pulled down by the copper.  This partly discharges the zinc.  It reduces the negative voltage, which reduces the repulsion/attraction forces.  Positive zinc atoms can escape again, so the corrosion process starts up again.  As zinc ions are pouring off the metal surface and into the water, the outer electrons left behind will travel through the conductive metal over to the copper, so there's a large electric current in the metal, matching the equal current of positive ions in the water.  It's a complete circuit, a closed circle of flowing charges.  The zinc dissolves quickly, the electric current heats the metal and the water, and this keeps happening until the zinc is all corroded away.  In modern terms you've created a shorted-out battery which gets hot and quickly runs down.\n\nNow the real trick is to break the connection between the zinc and copper, and insert various things into the gap!\n\nA battery is a chemically-fueled pump for electric charge.  One metal plate acts as the fuel.  It actually has two separate charge pumps, one on each metal surface.  They pump in opposite directions, and if two different kinds of metal are used, one pump wins.\n\n**tldr;**  two different metals in water get spontaneously charged with low-voltage static electricity.  Touch them together, stuff happens.\n"},

That sort of thing.","answer":"Since the other answers have covered the common dimensions, let's talk about spacetime a bit.\n\nSo back around 1900, Einstein had a revolutionary notion -- that time isn't some odd entity we can't explain, but rather it is another dimension. What makes this interesting is his theories on relativity.\n\nYou know that you can measure time in seconds, minutes, years, etc. You also know you can measure distance in meters, kilometers, etc.\n\nHowever, you can also measure distance *in time*. If I asked you how far it was to New York City, you could say \"Oh, its about 100 km up the road.\" or you could say \"It's about an hour down the road\".\n\nIn einstein's equations, time and distance are treated as the same entity -- those being units of light-seconds, light-hours, light-years, etc."},
{"title":"Why is the human body basically symmetrical with the exception of the liver, stomach, heart, and a few other bits?","answer":"There is a [link](http://www.juliantrubin.com/encyclopedia/psychology/facial_symmetry.html) between symmetry and perceived attractiveness in a potential mate. The gist is since symmetry is nature is \"hard\" to build , the more symmetric your features the \"healthier\" your genes are when considered by your potential mate. This can explain why mammals show more signs of symmetry on the outside than on the inside. "},

{"title":"ELI5: Instrumental Variable","question_detail":"[Instrumental Variable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_variable)\n\nMe confused long time.","answer":"It's a variable you use in statistical analysis as a proxy for another variable that you're interested in studying, but can't either because data would be too difficult to collect or because it would bring additional noise into the study.\n\nFor example, maybe you want to see the effect illegal migration from mexico has on communities in Arizona. You can't collect proper data, because of the nature of illegal immigration. You could use rainfall in communities in mexico as an \"instrument\" for migration rates. Namely, you first find the effect of rainfall changes on migration, then create a new variable based on that, then you run the actual regression you're interested in by using the data set you created from rainfall data as a stand-in.\n\nAnother reason to use instrumental variables is to eliminate spurious correlations. Let's say you want to see the effect smoking has on college students' grades. If you just look at the number of cigarettes smoked, your study would be fucked up because smokers are different from non smokers. Smokers are also more likely to be drinkers, more likely to be drug users, more likely to be poor. Heavy smokers are more likely to be male while most smokers are female. Namely, you're commiting the cardinal sin of regression analysis by \"putting a choice variable on the left hand side\" of the equation. People choose to smoke, that choice says something about them personally, and it will ruin your study because you can't account for personality. Anyways, you could use tax rates on cigarettes as an instrument. Presumably smokers smoke less and some quit altogether when cigarette taxes go up. First you regress smoking on tax changes, use the outcome to form a new \"expected smoking level given current taxes\" and you use the new variable as a stand in for smoking which is unrelated to anything about the students themselves."},
{"title":"[ELI5]: Quantum theory.","question_detail":"Please thankyou.","answer":"Quantum theory started as corrections to classic mechanics.\n\nIn simplest terms it mean that many things seem to be continuous instead are divided to tiny little steps.\n\nFor example when you heat up neon gas and the energy comes back out as light, it doesn't come out in an infinite number of colors but only those determined by finite (or quantum) little steps.  \n\n\nIt can seem freaky when you get deeper into it - the energy of a falling object is also quantized - that means what appears to be a smoothly falling object is instead jumping downward in tiny little increments.\n\nI tried to put more in ELI5 terms - but I had trouble  - the duality of nature - waves acting as particles and vice versa is inherently complicated.\n\nThe Wikipedia article on quantum mechanics would a good read and I could try to answer questions if you like.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics\n\n\n "},

{"title":"ELI5 why you get bags under our eyes when you're tired. ","answer":"Dark circles are the appearance of the blood vessels under the skin.  The skin around the eye is thin and delicate (around 0.5 mm thick compared with 2 mm in other areas), making it possible to see the vessels.    \n\n* tiredness causes the skin to pale, therefore making the vessels more visible. The body also retains water when sleep deprived, and for some, this excess water can cause puffiness around the eyes.  \n\nThere are various other reasons dark circle may appear worse for different people or at different times: \n\n* people with thinner skin, paler skin, and/or recessed eyes are prone to dark circles as it makes it easier for the blood vessels to be seen\n* dark circles tend to run in families\n* excessive eye itching (allergy season) can rupture blood vessels and make bruising (purple tinge) visible under the thin skin\n* any medications that dilate blood vessels can make them more visible\n* ageing causes the skin to loose its fatty layers, making the skin thinner and dark circles more visible"},

The domain name (hello.com) simply POINTS to a given server, the same way a street adress points to your home. This way, you can change servers by pointing it elsewhere. A URL (hello.com/hi.html) is just a file located at the root folder of that web server.\n\nA server is just a computer that serves files. You could even host your site yourself at home on your PC, albeit unreliably. It simply checks for the requested file, parses the code in it (if there is any), then returns plain HTML that your browser can read.\n\nWhen I say some files contain code, it's usually to receive parameters and behave accordingly. For example, hello.com/hi.php?product=23 might retrieve product #23 from a database, then use this data in the page. This is all done before you receive the page. WordPress and other content managers work like this: content is in a database, and when you call for a page, it retrieves it from a database, and puts it in a generic page.\n\nI'm typing on a phone right now, but feel free to ask for clarification."},

{"title":"Question about nerves","question_detail":"So, this is kind of tricky to explain; Say I cut open my arm and start touching my nerve endings in my muscles; I'm going to feel an immense amount of pain (right?)  Well how do the nerve endings know the difference between a finger touching them and a muscle touching them?  I.E: If a finger touching them sends off pain signals, how do they normally know not to send pain signals when they are resting inside/against my muscles?","answer":"Well, your premise is actually kind of incorrect. It's not so much the nerves in your body that detect things, but the nerve **endings**; these are called receptors. Your body has very specific receptors (called nociceptor), primarily in your skin but are elsewhere, that detect different kinds of pain. There are some that detect temperature, mechanical injury, or chemical injury.\n\nFor the most part, these nociceptors need a lot of stimulation before they get activated, this way minor changes don't hurt a lot.\n\nYour body also have receptors that only detect pressure, called mechanoreceptors. Again, these are primarily in your skin.\n\nBasically, your body has **very** specific sensory cells for different purposes in different places with different thresholds for what activates them."},

{"title":"Since smelling and tasting are essentially the same thing, why do things like vanilla and coffee taste so much different than they smell?","answer":"I can't answer this question like a textbook, but I'd like to add a personal note on it. I'm nearly completely anosmic (unable to smell) and yet still able to taste. From my experience and discussion with friends, I have personally found that while smell isn't the whole of taste, it does contribute to it. While my friends might enjoy spicy or vinegar-tasting foods because they can anticipate the flavor, I find things like hot peppers and pickles gag-inducing, simply because of the shock of tasting them with no warning. This explains the mental aspect, that is, if you expect a particular taste and get another, you'll notice it strongly.\n\nChemically, it's probable that certain foods contain some particles that are more likely to waft into the air and cause a scent, while others tend to remain behind and contribute to taste. If these particles are dramatically different, you end up with something like vanilla. I understand vanilla smells very sweet because only the vanilla particles reach your nose, but tastes bitter because it contains a concentrated alcohol."},

The president holds virtually no power over the global supply and demand problems that create our oil and gas prices.\n\nWhat he could do as president, potentially, is to open federal lands and offshore areas to drilling. It would take years for the changes to have significant effect. \n\nHe could also potentially propose to do something about or diminishing refining capacity. But he's gonna be hard pressed on that issue. The market is choosing to shutter refining capacity, and any plans he created would be contra-market, and probably not supported by a lot of people.\n\nPresently there are no potential supplies of oil and in the US or offshore that could come close to making us \"oil independent\".

Thus the answer is twofold.

Tell me about the pressure chambers of the head and where the pain comes from when it's blocked.\n\nAlso, any ideas or evidence as to why a complex pressure chamber system in the sinus would evolve?","answer":"You are a can. A can of beans that is at 0 meters elevation and is sealed all around except a tinny hole in the lid.\n\nThat means that normally you have 1 atmosphere of pressure pressing down on you from the outside. To counter this, there is 1 atm of pressure inside you, pressing outside - thus the net flow on air to and from the tinny hole is zero.\n\nNow, gradually, you are taken to a height of 40,000 feet. The pressure inside you is 1 atm, outside you it is less than 1 atm. The air from inside you starts escaping from the tinny hole. Since your climb was gradual, the flow of air inside to outside was gradual. Now, at this height, your internal and external pressure is equal at (for example) 0.91 atm.\n\nNow you skydive. You fall like a brick and reach 10,000 feet in 10 seconds. Air from outside (which is at 0.98 atm) rushed through the hole inside (where the pressure is lower, at 0.91 atm). This forced rush of air causes you discomfort and, in severe cases, pain. To add further obstacles, there is a diaphragm obstructing free flow of air and there are liquids which further complicate the airflow path.\n\nIn another example, you have 2 ~~tinny~~ tiny holes (ear and nasal) and there is some slime blocking them (flu, blocked sinuses etc). All the air flow pushes against the slime to pass through, causing you more pain (bridge of the nose, between eyebrows).\n\nThis complex system actually helps. If there was a large gaping air-pressure-equalization hole, I imagine it'd act like what happens when in the movies there is a hole in the wall of the airplane."},

The idea behind chemistry, I would say, is that no matter how good an actor is, he/she/it can never *fully* become a character.  Meaning that there's always some of Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, or Flava Flav in there.\n\nChemistry is what they call it when that little bit of the actor that they can't get rid of either agrees or disagrees with that little bit of the other actor.  And it doesn't always have to be male/female, nor does it always have to be *good*.\n\nGood examples of chemistry:\n\nRedford and Newman in The Sting or in Butch Cassidy.  Their characters seemed like easygoing friends, and it really felt like they were too.\n\nPitt and Clooney - whatever you say about the whole of the Ocean's movies, the two of them are very good on screen together.\n\nAn example of the \"dislike\" chemistry could be - and I don't know this as true at all, it's just the way I feel it - Pacino and De Niro in Heat.  They're very similar actors, and their characters are directly at odds with each other, so the idea that it's two actors sitting down to do an uncomfortable scene together where the two characters (one is a cop and one's a criminal) sit down to an uncomfortable cup of coffee could be an example of \"bad\" chemistry working for a better scene.\n\nAs an example of not necessarily chemistry, but how behind-the-scenes things can drive good performances, take the [bathtub scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3lT_dpghBw) from Rain Man.  Dustin Hoffman has said that when he's freaking out as the character, what he's actually doing is freaking out at himself for not being able to fully inhabit the character.  What Dustin Hoffman was doing was beating himself up (literally) for not being a good enough actor, but what we see is good acting.\n\nSoooo, hope that helps some.  Lemme know if there's something else I can talk about.\n\nEdit:  Thought up the one I forgot before!  Saving Private Ryan - all of Tom Hanks' squad worked out with trainers for a while (I think 6 weeks?) before the movie.  Really got their asses busted, full boot camp.  But Matt Damon didn't.  He wanted it that way so that the squad would really feel their indignation at Damon's character."},

{"title":"ELI5: How wireless internet works","answer":"**[Copied and pasted from \"ELI5: WiFi, how do you even?\"](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/pq67f/eli5_wifi_how_do_you_even/c3rfb83)**\n\nWell, I'm gonna go with the IEEE 802.11b/g standard because that's what I know best.\n\nSo there's this model of networking, called the [OSI model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model), that splits how computers (and other such devices) SHOULD talk to each other. I'll run through that ULTRA quick.\n\nSKIP IF YOU'RE BORED\n------------------------\n--------------\n* Application: Whatever your OS does that requires network traffic. If you are playing a round of Starcraft, your game makes some data, and pushes it out of the application layer.\n* Presentation/Session: meh, you don't need to know.\n* Transport: Decide on a port-protocol so your data is distinguishable. For example, XBox Live runs on a very specific set of UDP/TCP ports.\n* Network: Form a global address to communicate with other devices. IP V6 is the current \"standard\"; IP V4 used to be, and had REALLY well known/easily distinguished levels of communicating (Class A/B/C depending on how many computers you wanted to talk to (Local Area vs Wide Area))\n* Data Link/MAC layer -- Take **ALLL** the above, wrap it all together, and associate it with some kind of unique-to-the-computer ID, as even IP V6 could have non-unique addresses. You don't want your Starcraft data going to the wrong computer, do you? (These are where MAC addresses come in handy)\n* Physical: This is where IEEE 802.11 differs from, say, 802.3 (Ethernet). It's the media used to transmit data out.\n\n--------------\nATTENTION, NOW, PLZKTHX\n---------------\n\nEthernet uses a PHYSICAL cable, with digital data representing the encoded 1's and 0's from all the OSI layers.\n\nWiFi goes an extra mile here -- it MODULATES the data in order to best represent/most efficiently represent (different QAMs and stuff, it gets crazy) 1's and 0's that ARE currently digital, and convert them to analog.\n\nWhy analog? Because radio waves are analog! \n\nSo your **source** takes a packet of data, moves *DOWN* the OSI model, then at the physical layer, takes those encoded and encapsulated and etc raw 1's and 0's and maps them to a radio wave using modulation (that's actually kind of redundant, modulation IS the mapping).\n\nYour **destination** (for instance, your wireless router) then receives that signal, DEMODULATES it (turns those analog waves back into 1's and 0's), and decodes it going *UP* the OSI model. In the router's case, it goes up only as many layers as it needs, say, to find out where to forward that data to, then it re-sends it (becoming a source).\n\nYour destination (being your friends computer, now), receives the waves, demodulates, goes up the OSI model, eventually ensuring that the right application gets the data on the right port at the right time, and has just learned that you Zerg rushed him.\n\nAll this takes place in the span of a few nanoseconds.\n\n**BUT HOW DOES...THOSE THINGS I ASKED?**\n\nSpecifically, and kinda ELI5; the laptop constantly broadcasts HEY I'M HERE IS ANYONE LISTENING (with very small packets, this is a \"scan\"), and (some) routers are programmed to reply to such scans with \"I'M HERE, CONNECT TO ME\". You can actually get around this by hiding your SSID. This little handshake is done through the process I described above.\n\nAnd because it's all radio waves, moving around doesn't really effect your communication with the router. Think of your router as a GIANT CIRCLE. For the most part, as long as you're in range of your router's ability-to-receive-radio-waves (that circle), you can talk to it. It doesn't \"keep track\" of your computer like \"HEY, LORDZARTH IS IN THE LIVING ROOM\" (though you actually could with some clever triangulation...) so much as it says HEY LORDZARTH IS STILL IN MY CIRCLE."},

However, I feared that they weren't washed well enough, so then I ran each one individually under cold water and rubbed it.

The whole process took about 10 minutes and netted about 30 blueberries, or 1 every 20 seconds. Is there a better way?

The ball comes off the rim and you push the guy to get room to grab the rebound. That is a loose ball foul. Since you didn't have possession at the time of the foul it can't be an offensive foul and since he didn't have possession of the ball it can't be a defensive foul. "},

{"title":"ELI5: Why is pokemon so great? ","question_detail":"I missed the craze, but I love video games! When I saw a pic of two gameboys linked up I thought man, I bet I would have loved that.\n","answer":"I'm not really sure this is appropriate for ELI5...maybe /r/gaming, [/r/askreddit](/r/askreddit) or [/r/pokemon](/r/pokemon) or [/r/ludology](/r/ludology) .  That said, I think a significant part of Pokemon's popularity simply came from the fact that, well, it was a fad.  And that isn't meant as an insult.  I was part of the \"first wave\" of Pokemon fans...born in 89.  The majority of boys in my class loved the game.\n\nIn order for a game to become that popular--even if its with children--it has to be good.  Or at least good at it's intended goals.  It was a very addicting game.  But what skyrocketed it to popularity was the fact that it was easy to create a culture around it.\n\nIn the late 90s, it was a symbol of pride to be able to rattle off all 150 pokemon in order.  You fight tournaments during recess.  Everyone around you (even the girls!) could identify any pokemon, and if they couldn't, they'd be mocked.  We developed legends about Pokemon, like how to capture Mew and when Missingno was discovered, that rocked our world.\n\nOur school used to have a \"spaghetti supper\" every year, a fundraiser thing.  It was a thing that happened at night.  These became Pokemon conventions, where kids would bring their gameboys and battle and trade with each other.  But it wasn't something we *planned*, it was something we *assumed*, because it was such a big part of our lives that of course we'll bring our gameboys there.  Why the fuck *wouldn't* we fight pokemon there?\n\nAnd today it lives on.  Look how many submissions there are on reddit about pokemon.  Legends and myths and inside jokes about the original games are posted on reddit everyday, and few people say \"what the fuck is this?\"  Only those born in weird countries or those who were too young or old say that.  Everyone in the first wave though...they understand most of the jokes/references.  \n\nPokemon is something that most late-80s early-90s children understand.  It's something we all share.

{"title":"ELI5: Stuxnet","question_detail":"I was reading [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/qk612/lulzsec_leader_betrays_all_of_anonymous/) on the front page and it was mentioned quite frequently; Described as \"the most vicious malware of all-time.\" \n\nTried watching the [Ted Talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/ralph_langner_cracking_stuxnet_a_21st_century_cyberweapon.html) but it was just way over my head. \n\nWhat makes it so crazy? Why is it different than any other virus or malware? ","answer":"Viruses and malware, ages ago, used to be the equivalent of a computer geek's prank.  They'd spread out, infect a computer and print strange messages, or play songs, or do other rather harmless things.  People did it just so they could be famous.\n\nSome of them started to be malicious, for no other reason than they could be.  They'd mess up the files on your computer or, at worst, delete your hard drive.  Rather than just being famous, people were now trying to be infamous.\n \nThen, when the internet became popular, some rather immoral people found that you could actually make money writing malware.  You could use them to control people's computers.  You could use their computer to send out spam e-mail, or collect email for lists that you could sell, or collect credit card numbers, or what ever.  Nasty things.  You could actually write malware to make money, illegally.\n\nStuxnet didn't do any of that.  Stuxnet got on your desktop computer and did .... nothing. That was strange.  But lets get back to that in a second.  Because the way it spread was pretty scary.\n\nWhen you break into a computer you need something called an exploit.  It's basically a bug in the system that gives you access you shouldn't have.   \n\nGenerally, when these bugs are discovered the company that makes the software fixes them quickly so that nothing can use them.    Unfortunately, not everyone updates their software immediately.  Between the time that the bug is discovered and the time that people get the updates, malware writers can take advantage of the exploit.  \n\nBut, since writing software takes awhile, it's very rare to have an exploit that lasts long enough for people to take advantage of.\n\nBut, there's something called a *zero-day exploit*.  These are bugs that exist in software that no one has found out about yet.   If you were to figure out an exploit and not tell anyone you could write malware that would use that exploit and your malware would be very successful.\n\nThese zero-day exploits are very rare, and are highly valued by the bad people who make malware.  People pay big money for them.\n\nStuxnet took advantage of one of these.\n\nActually, that's not true.   \n\nIn order to spread, Stuxnet use **four** zero-day exploits.  Four zero-day exploits no one knew about. And not some exploit on some unknown peice of badly written software. These were zero-day exploits in Microsoft Windows.  That's completely unheard of.  This isn't something that one person in their basement figured out.  This is somethings way, way bigger.  Besides, if you had four zero-day exploits, why would you use them in one piece of malware?  It would make more sense to save them, and use them in four different peices of malware.   Unless someone wanted to make REALLY sure Stuxnet got its job done.\n\nThere's also a host of other technically difficult things Stuxnet does.  So much so that there is no way one person wrote it by themselves.  This is something that would take a team of programmers months and months to design and test.  Stuxnet was something entirely new.\n\nBut what did it do? \n\nNothing.... until it found a Siemens supervisory control and data acquisition -- or SCADA -- system. And not just any old Siemes control system.  Stuxnet checked to make sure specific types of hard drives were attached and that the system was attached to specific types of control systems.  \n\nWhat does all this mean? Why would it check for specific hardware configurations? It seems it Stuxnet was looking for Iranian nuclear control systems\n\nDid you get that?  This was a computer program specifically designed to spread across the internet and infect Iranian **nuclear facilities**. It knew exactly what it was looking for. This is the stuff of science-fiction novels.\n\n And not just any old nuclear facility.  They now figure Stuxnet was designed to infiltrate specifically the Natanz nuclear enrichment lab.  And once it got there it got control of the control systems it messed with the centrifuge's speed and tried to break the machinery.  In the end, Stuxnet destroyed around 1,000 centrifuges in Natanz.\n\nWho was behind it? Well, no one can be sure.  Because of the complexity of the program, most people think it must be a government.   Israel maybe, or the USA.   But no one is sure.\n\nBut, the idea that computer programs can be written, with that level of sophistication, to infiltrate nuclear enrichment plants....?  Scary stuff.\n\n \n"},

It's also about making your friends happy. The early Humanists said that making Mr. God happy is great, but you *also* need to be really nice to everyone *just for the sake of being nice*. And they said that everyone can be an inventor or a great artist or a great athlete in their own way, because humans are actually pretty great. \n\nLater on, less people believed in God. Doing things that have nothing to do with God is called \"Secular\". So, Secular Humanists are people who are pretty nice and ambitious, because they think that humans can do really great things, without having to believe in God. "},

It used to be for 2% milk, the prices for gallons and half gallons were [$2.43 for a half gallon, and $2.39 for a full gallon.](http://imgur.com/a/rqzOm#0) At first I thought something along the lines of \"Well, they must have gotten a lot more full gallons in this shipment and are trying to push them out before they go bad.\" This was also accompanied by the fact that 1% milk and whole milk were normal (Relatively-- the gallon was about 7 and 14 cents, respectively, higher than their half gallon counterparts). But the price stayed at that point for **three months**. \n\nToday, I go to Walmart for milk and find this: [$2.36 for half gallon, $1.99 for full gallon.](http://imgur.com/a/rqzOm#1) Crazy! And to top it off, the prices for 1% and whole milk have gone this way as well (With the full gallon being lower priced than the half). Why are they priced this way?

{"title":"ELI5: How are we able to slingshot around the moon?","answer":"Assume you're going towards the moon and at the same time the moon is moving towards you (because hey, the moon moves too). You're both approaching each other head-on and then you 'slingshot' around back to the direction you came from. From the perspective of the moon, you approach and leave at the same speed which is what most people would expect and shouldn't come as a surprise.\n\nThe trick is that the moon was originally moving towards you. Since both you and the moon are now moving in the same direction, the only way that you could possibly be leaving at the same speed you approached **relative to the moon** is if you're now moving at the moon's speed + your original speed. You've essentially just gained the speed of the moon from a 3rd person's perspective!\n\nExplaining why this doesn't violate the law conservation of momentum/energy: you actually speed up and the moon slows down but because the moon is so much larger than you the amount by which it slows down is much less than the amount by which you speed up.\n\nDepending on the angle of your approach you can gain up to 100% (technically very slightly less) of the planet/moon's speed."},

[The Flame Challenge](http://flamechallenge.org/) sounds a lot like what you guys and gals do so I thought you might like to give it a whirl.  It asks you to explain fire as you would to an 11 year old. ","answer":"Heat breaks a bunch of groups of atoms (\"molecules\") off from the \"fuel\", because the atoms move too fast.\n\nThen they get so hot that they start sending off light (in the form of photons, as always).\n\nAnd the fire keeps going in the same way domino reactions keeps going. Something is stable but will release enough energy to trigger a new reaction and then some. So it keeps going until there are no more fuel, like how a domino reaction ends when there are no more dominoes standing up."},

But they still glow/emit light? I really do need an ELI5 on this, my head hurt after reading all the askscience answers.\n\nIf you want to boil this down: http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/njukv/how_could_a_neutron_star_emit_light/\n\nPlease do!\n","answer":"It's actually really easy to emit photons (light particles). All you really need is energy and time, and eventually a photon will probably shoot off. It's true that neutron stars don't have much energy left from fusion (the way normal stars emit light) or excited electrons (the way most non-nuclear things emit light; a neutron star doesn't have electrons because they all got smashed into protons to make neutrons), but there are plenty of other types of energy (rotational kinetic, heat, unstable neutron configurations, impacts from other objects, etc.) that still apply. In particular, neutron stars actually start out extremely hot, even hotter than normal main sequence stars. It's this heat that creates most of the photons."},

{"title":"ELI5: How do they diffuse a bomb, is it as simple as snipping the right wire?","question_detail":"In the movies it's always a guy sweating over cutting a blue wire or a red wire. But what exactly do the bomb disposal team do to diffuse a bomb?","answer":"Most of the time it's as simple as snipping *any* wire, really.  The simplest way to do a bomb is to have a timer (or a phone or anything) that will send an electric current to a fuse that will ignite the explosive.  If you remove the timer, or the fuse, or the battery, or the explosive, or cut the wires in between, you defused the bomb. (BTW that's how it's spelled.  It's called de-fusing because you remove the fuse or prevent it to operate).\n\nIt's very simple BUT that's not how it's done.  Because that's only \"most of the time\" and they won't take chances.  There might be a protection device that will trigger the fuse if the bomb is moved or if a wire is cut.  Alternatively, the bomber could be watching, ready to trigger the bomb if you get close.  So the basic procedure is to attempt to control the environment and then blow up the bomb.\n"},

What is this? Is this some sort of ultrasonic hearing ability or something? Or possibly feeling very faint traces of static electricity in the air? I need answers!","answer":"The electron gun in a CRT television and the backlamp in an LCD television both emit a faint very-high-pitched hum, though the latter is more subtle. Try this: sit in a silent room, and pay attention to your ears. Notice how you always hear a very faint vibrating ring? It's very mild tinnitus, which everyone has to some degree; if you've been to a lot of concerts or driven motorcycles, yours will be more intense, but everyone has *some*. Because it's always there, your brain's pretty good at ignoring it, and you usually don't notice. And that's true for a lot of constant sounds, really; after an hour or two in a room with a loud fan or air conditioner, you don't notice it anymore. Well, the whine emitted by TVs is close enough to natural tinnitus that you don't usually notice it, and even if you do, because it's constant and steady, you tune it out after a while in the room with it. That's why you tend to notice it as you're walking into a room with a TV.\n\nSo unfortunately, you're not psychic and there's no static electricity in the air, you're just noticing a sound that's normally too mild, too constant to subtle to be noticed."},

{"title":"ELI5: The Bank Transfer System - Why does it take multiple business days to transfer money between accounts?","answer":"It's a holdover from the old days before computers.\n\nWay back in the day before computers, when banks had to keep track of everything on paper, it was way too much of a pain to transfer money in the middle of the day. You'd have to hire a guy to take the money, run across town, deposit it in the other bank, run back, and then have to do that all over again. It's much easier to keep track of all the transfers, then do them all at once. This is called a batch - which helps with accounting also, since instead of handling individual checks or bills, you can handle many at once.\n\nBeing as banks were important, there came to be a lot of regulations around their activities, and once they have something that works, banks really do not want to change unless they have to. It doesn't cost them much extra to keep doing things this way.\n\nSo even though it's technically possible to do real time transfers now, banks don't because that's not how they used to do it, the regulations haven't caught up, and doing so it's going to get them any more customers or save them any money."},

It looks like they're demonstrating heating with a steel object embedded in ice.   If true, the hot object would immediately sink to the bottom of the cube, form an insulating bubble around itself, then boil any water that was on the stone below.  (Yep, we see steam coming out from below the ice.)\n\nInduction heaters work in the same way that electric transformers work:  if magnetic fields are changing, they will push around the free electrons found inside a nearby metal.  In other words, changing magnetic fields \"induce\" an electric current in metal.\n\nWith the type of heater shown, there might be many thousand amperes in the square coil.  This magnetically pumps any nearby free electrons, so it creates another enormous current in the hidden steel object.  The steel object gets white hot, just like a lightbulb filament.\n\nWouldn't this instantly vaporize the ice?  Nah.  You can find videos where a guy is heating steel parts with an induction coil, and using his bare hand to hold the steel a couple inches away from the glowing hot section.  Air and stone is even better as a heat insulator.  But if they kept the video running longer, you'd see the ice melt away and reveal the hidden steel object inside.\n"},

I'm 37 years old, and I can confidently say that I've never needed to solve a quadratic equation on the back of an envelope. The geometry I've actually needed to use has pretty much amounted to \"just over three diameters\" and once or twice even the length of the hypotenuse, and I have yet to encounter a real-world problem that could only be solved with my knowledge of calculus. \n\nI've had a bit more use for the discrete-maths side of things, being in the IT industry and all (sysadmin and a bit of webdev), and a knowledge of Bayes' theorem is awfully useful when arguing on the internet... but they're fairly special cases. \n\nThe chief benefit I've derived from the study of mathematics has been an improved ability to discern and quantify relationships, and enough common ground to be able to pick up specialized tools when they're required - and while this is certainly worth the effort IMHO, it smells a lot like vague handwavy bullshit that I'd never have accepted at face value. \n\nSo what the hell do I tell my kid, should the day arise that he demands a justification for all this damn symbol-wrangling?

{"title":"Can someone more knowledgeable than I explain what benefits the US derives from holding the world's reserve currency.","answer":"It means that the dollar is always popular and in demand especially in uncertain times.  Because of this, when there's trouble, investors tend to flock to dollar holdings which makes the dollar \"stronger\" than other world currencies.  When the dollar is getting stronger it means you can buy more foreign goods per dollar than you could the day before.  This is good for a massive importing market such as the US which buys so much of its goods from abroad.  (It's also partially why US manufacturing suffers so much.)  This reduces how much the US suffers in difficult economic times, since troubles at home (deficit etc) that might weaken the dollar, are offset by everyone else buying dollars as a precaution against their own worries.\n\nAnother good side for the US is that it's convenient for international trade to be conducted in one currency (so rather than keeping track of transactions in dozens of currencies, companies keep their eye mainly on buy/selling in dollars) which means that its marginally cheaper for the US to do international business, since everyone else is generally paying a cost for exchanging their currency into dollars before trading."},

{"title":"Can someone in the financial/insurance/auto industry explain GAP insurance?","answer":"I'm not in the industry, but I can offer an easy explanation of GAP insurance with an example. \n\nLet's say you buy a 20$K car and you get a loan for 20$K to pay for it and you buy car insurance (legally required where I live). \n\nIf the next day the car is sitting in your driveway and a satellite falls on it, then the car insurance company will give you money for the value of the car, ***which is now less than 20$K*** since you drove it off the car lot (likely it would be around ~18$K depending on the car make/model). If you had GAP insurance, then that insurance will pay the amount you owe on the loan, which means they give you 20$k and you can spend the 18$K car insurance money on a new car (or they might just set you up with the same make/model of the car you lost, depends on the car insurance). If you don't have GAP insurance then you would spend the ~18$K paying off part of your 20$K loan and still owe money on a car you don't have anymore and have to buy a whole new car to replace it. \n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: What Magnet Links are and how they work (and how they're different from regular torrent links)?","answer":"BitTorrent clients participate in what's called a \"Distributed Hash Table (DHT).\"  The specific type of DHT being used is called Kademlia or Kad for short.  Sometimes it's called the Kad network.\n\nEach Magnet link has a hash value of the .torrent file it represents.  (A hash is just taking all of the data in the file and churning out a fixed-length number representation.).  I believe the number of bits used might be 128 or 160.\n\nThe Kad network works every participant choosing a unique ID number, which is also the same number of bits as all of the hashes.  Let's say 128.  When you participate in the Kad network, you send packets to other people in the Kad network, and the packets contain your ID.  The other people reply back with their ID, and you keep a list of all of the people you've seen.  You are especially interested in people that have a lot of the same prefix bits as you, so you store even more of those people in your list.\n\nWhen someone makes a Magnet link for a torrent, they compute the hash.  Then they search the Kad network for the people who have an ID with the most number of prefix bits as the Magnet link.  This is called being \"close.\"  The more prefix bits in common, the closer you are.  So the person making the Magnet link for the torrent contacts the people who are closest to the Magnet link in their list and they ask those people if they know of anyone who's even *closer*.  Eventually, the person making the Magnet link finds the closest 10 or 100 people.  Each of these people store the .torrent file on their computer.\n\nThen, whenever someone wants to download a torrent from a Magnet link, they are given the hash.  They connect to Kad and seek out the people closest to the hash and ask them if they have the .torrent file and/or if they know anyone even closer to the hash.  Eventually, you'll find someone who has the .torrent file and they'll send you the .torrent, or your search will fail and you'll never get the .torrent file.\n\nThe benefits of using Kad are that .torrents are not stored in a centralized location.  A centralized location can be shut down.  Kad is also pretty fast.  If you double the number of people participating, it only makes searches take 1 step longer."},
{"title":"What make USB 3.0 faster than USB 2.0?","question_detail":"What make USB 3.0 faster than USB 2.0?","answer":"Devices communicate at different frequencies.  These are when voltage goes either high or low.  Each high-low cycle is called a pulse.  The frequency of the pulses determine how much data you can send per second.  The higher the frequency, the more pulses you get, the more data you can send.  But the higher the frequency, the more expensive hardware you need to detect the changes in the pulses.\n\nUSB 2.0 operates at one frequency, and all devices using USB 2.0 must be able to operate at that frequency.  USB 3.0 operates at a faster frequency and as such all USB 3.0 devices must operate at that frequency.\n\nNow, it's easier to go slower than it is to go faster.  This is why you can plug a USB 3.0 device into a USB 2.0 port, or vice-versa."},

You also know that the triangle is a right triangle. With this information, you can use the sine function to find the length h of the hypotenuse, which is the side across from the right angle.\n\nHere's how the sine function would work in this case:\n    sin A = a/h\n    h*sin A = a\n    h = a/sin A\nNow you just plug in the values into a calculator and you know the length of h. Remember to watch your units.\n\nBasically, \n\n* the sine function relates an angle, the side opposite that angle, and the hypotenuse.\n\n* the cosine function relates an angle, the side closest to it that is not the hypotenuse (the adjacent side), and the hypotenuse.\n\n\n* the tangent function relates an angle, the side opposite from it, and the side adjacent to it.\n\n\n        sin A = a/h    \n        cos A = b/h    \n        tan A = a/b\n \nThat should to it for ELI5, methinks."},

{"title":"ELI5: Neoliberalism","answer":"**First, [this article](http://slantchev.ucsd.edu/courses/pdf/Snyder%20-%20One%20World,%20Rival%20Theories.pdf) is an awesome (and far better) explanation of different international theories than I provide.  But I'll still take a swing at trying to explain neo-liberalism like you're five.  If my simplifications misrepresent any of the theories I invite others to reply to me with corrections.**\n\nTo explain it like you're five, imagine you're going to watch a race.  How do you know who will win?  Some people would tell you that it doesn't matter who drives the car, all that matters is that the car is fast.  Others will tell you that it doesn't matter how fast the car is in general, what's more important is that it's just faster than the other cars.  Others still will tell you that what's important is the person behind the wheel.  A great driver can adapt to a difficult track and make the right decisions to win the race.  A fast car helps, of course, but a lot of speed in the hands of an idiot won't win you the race.\n\nTheories of international relations look at the world in a similar way.  Realists don't care about who's behind the wheel, they look to the car itself and how fast it is.  In the case of international relations, a realist looks at states and how powerful they are compared to other countries.  Realists don't care about the kind the type government in a country, just its power.  Classical realists, like Hans Morganthau, allow for there to be many ways to measure a state's power.  The state may have a great military, abundant resources, or a strangle-hold on market forces.  Neo-Realists, like John Mearsheimer, believe the only power that matters is the power that makes one country more secure compared to another.  Instead of thinking that power in general is the most important thing, neo-realists are concerned with security.\n\nClassical Liberals are people who believe that the driver matters more than the speed of the car itself.  In terms of international relations, they believe that the kind of government a country has influences the decisions they will make.  Immanuel Kant argued in Perpetual Peace that over time as more countries become democracies, there will be less war.  His argument is that when a country is posed with the question of war, in a democracy, the people will recognize that it is their necks on the line and they would never willing vote to go to war.  This is what is known as democratic peace theory.  A realist who is concerned with the power of a country relative to other countries wouldn't worry about the kind of government a country has, a liberal would say that a democratic country wouldn't go to war with another democratic country, regardless of the power of both countries.\n\n**So what is Neo-Liberalism, then?**\n\nThey look to the world in a similar way as classical liberals.  They agree with liberals that states themselves are not the only significant factor in figuring out what actions will occur.  But instead of focusing on the internal structure of a state (such as the type of government) neo-liberals look to organizations which transcend state boundaries.  Neo-liberals believe that treaties, international organizations (both governmental and non-governmental), and other bodies have power that is distinct from the power seen in countries.  Neo-liberals believe that these organizations have the power to influence the world on their own whereas realists would say these organizations only have power so long as those organizations make decisions which coincide with state-interests."},

[Texas Instruments SN76489](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_SN76489) ([PSG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_Sound_Generator))\n\n\nSide question: why are two separate chips required?","answer":"Why two sound chips?  That's the easy question.  There's different ways of making sounds electronically.\n\nSynthesis is good at making \"musical\" sounds (think keyboards and electronic instruments) with very little processing power - early synthesizers were purely analog machines.  I won't go into much detail about *how* FM synthesis works (it's ugly shit with lots of math) but, in short, the CPU just needs to tell the synth chip \"hey, make voice #1 sound like a flute and play an E-flat\" and it does it.\n\nThen you have \"sound\" chips that just play back any sound - they're good for recorded things &amp; sound effects.  The problem is that you either have to record the sound ahead of time or use lots of CPU power to create it from scratch.\n\nGiven that an old system like the Genesis had very little RAM, storage capacity or spare CPU cycles, this was a compromise to get sound effects and music at the same time.  Modern systems tend to have just \"sound\" chips because they have the storage to play back MP3-style music."},

In the movie, the secret twins are willing to live their entire lives a single person to hide the fact that there are two of them. That is how they were able to crack the illusion of the fish bowl... they reasoned that the Chinese guy was willing to live his entire life as an infirm old man just to pull off that one illusion.

{"title":"ELI5: Direct Deposit?","question_detail":"So this is the first time an employer is paying me via direct deposit. I called my bank in the middle of the night yesterday because my money still hadn't posted. I read up a little on my bank's website, and it says \"it may take up to one or two months for your money to appear in your account.\" WAT. Then my bank tells me \"lawl we don't have your money!\" and could do little to explain the process of how the money changes hands and all that. I talked to my boss today, and he says that the company that pays out the direct deposit had sent my check to the wrong person, but that it would be resolved in a couple of days. All this has left me wondering how the fuck direct deposit works and why the fuck does the bank need proof that my account is still active and wants to hold my money for a solid month before releasing it into my hands, as if I haven't banked with them for over half a fucking decade!?","answer":"I don't know where they got the 30 days.\n\nThe Expedited Funds Availability Act of 1987 allows banks to hold checks for up to 5 days for a variety of reasons, like for new account holders, large or out of state checks, or if you have a history of overdrafts.  They have to notify you if they hold them for any longer.\n\nUnless there is some exception for direct deposits, which technically is just another check, I have no idea what they were talking about.\n\nThat said, Wells Fargo has an extremely bad reputation when it comes to customer service.  Perhaps the rep was making shit up to blow you off.  Don't let it leave a bad taste for direct deposit, I've been using it for years without a problem.  Much more convenient and reliable than a paper check."},

{"title":"ELI5: NFL Bounty-Gate","question_detail":"What exactly happened? How does this impact the NFL and what impact do the punishments have on the league?","answer":"For years, the was a wide spread but under the table practice of rewarding defensive player for hard hits, particularly ones that \"took out\" key offensive players, whether by rattling them or actually injuring them.  The ethics on this are murky...there is nothing wrong with rewarding a player for making a good play, but the concern is these bounty would encourage cheap shots specifically to injure.\n\nNew Orleans got caught.  It is unclear how much was because they were doing it more and how much it was just bad luck.  Unfortunately for them, there was evidence that pretty much everyone in the organization knew.  Even worse, the NFL has a new emphasis on player safety, and were looking to make an example.\n\nThe punishments will hurt New Orleans a lot and St. Louis a little.  In a addition to the punishments, every NFL team has to affirm they won't tolerate bounties, which means the punishment will be even more severe the next team that gets caught."},

Does that mean you have to be home when the item arrive?\n* How do you pay for shipping?\n\nAny other information that you think I should know would also be appreciated!  ","answer":"You give them an address to ship to. Depending on the shipping company or type of item you buy, you may be required to sign for the package when it is delivered. Generally, anyone actually at the location can sign for it, the delivery person/company doesn't care. If no one is around they will leave a note on your door saying what time they tired to deliver it, how many times they will try, and instructions to go to your local delivery company office to pick the item up in person.\n\n If the package doesn't require a signature, the delivery person may leave it in front of your door, in the front office (apartment), or if they feel like the package may get stolen they will leave a note saying how many times they will try to deliver it and give instructions for you to pick it up in their office if needed.\n\nMost online stores will calculate the cost of shipping for you and add it into your total charge. The cost will be based on the weight of the item, the distance it will be shipped, and how quickly you want it delivered (next day, 2 days, ground aka 3-5 days). "},

{"title":"ELI5: Why do bubbles lose their colour before they pop?","question_detail":"Ever blown a bubble and seen the rainbow colours sliding over its surface? Why do those colours go grey just before they pop? What causes any colour in the first place?","answer":"Bubbles don't have a colour of their own, after all, they are transparent. The reason you see colours when you look at bubbles is actually to do with the way that different colours of light have different wavelengths. These wavelengths are very very short - about 700 nanometers for red light and 400 for blue light, with green in between. White light is made from all sorts of wavelengths of light mixed together.\n\nA bubble's \"skin\" has a thickness, and light reflects from both the outside of the skin and the inside of the skin (a bit like how when you look in a thick mirror, or through a thick window, you can sometimes see two pictures of yourself, one from the front of the glass and one from the back of the glass). The thickness of a bubble's skin is within a range or tiny thicknesses that is small enough that light bouncing from the outside of the skin can \"interfere\" with light bouncing from the inside - that is, some wavelengths will cancel out, and others will reinforce, so various colours will become more prominent. As the thickness of a bubble is not even all the way through, it will be different colours on different parts of the bubble - that's why they look 'oily'.\n\nBubbles pop when a part of their skin becomes too thin to hold together and a hole appears (which rapidly rips the bubble apart, too fast to see). As a bubble gets nearer to popping, this means its skin is thinning, and as it thins, the distance between the inside and outside of the skin obviously gets smaller. Therefore the light from the inside and outside of the skin doesn't interfere with each other any more (at least, not by an amount that makes a difference to human eyesight) and that's why bubbles appear to lose their colour before they burst."},
{"title":"ELI5: How do the lights at a rock show (where the tempo isn't pre-recorded or steady) seem to change with the beat?","question_detail":"I understand with electronic music, as BPMs can be calculated and that information can be used in programmed stuff on the fly.  But with a rock concert (not the prerecorded style, real rock), how do these lights change?  On one night, the song might be playing at 104 BPM, and then next night, it might be at 112 BPM, so it can't be something pre-programmed?\n\nIs it done in real time with sensors that predict what the speed is?  Even in old Led Zeppelin videos, the lights dim right as a new dramatic part starts, is there someone backstage who knows the song and keeps attention the whole show, changing the lights?\n\nModern bands that seem to value improvisation, like The White Stripes, Muse, Queens of the Stone Age, Nine Inch Nails, etc... all seem to have extensive light shows that match the beat.  Is it software, someone behind the scenes, or are they just really good at hiding the fact that they're playing along with a click track in their ear?","answer":"If you understand basics of electronic music, then just realize that MIDI can be used to play lights as well as sounds."},
{"title":"ELI5: How do bookies make money?","question_detail":"I've read the [wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_of_bookmaking), but I still don't understand how they turn a profit.\n\nI think I understand how odds work, but I fail to see how the bookie doesn't end up breaking even in the long run.","answer":"ELI5 version: I make a bet with you that if Team A wins a football match I will give you 9 dollars back for every 10 dollars you bet me. I then turn around and make a bet with another person that if Team B wins that same match I will give them back 9 dollars for every 10 dollars they bet me.\n\nLet's say you both bet me $10. As the bookie, I collect $20 from both of you, but I will only pay out $19 dollars to the winner. So I make a profit of $1.\n\nSo, the ELI5 in a perfect world, the bookie makes a profit by balancing their books and offering below dollar for dollar odds.\n\nNon-ELI5 answer: In the real world, it is very difficult for bookies to balance their books. They have thousands of people betting different amounts all the time. They change their odds to make each outcome more attractive at any given time, but making a profit purely from balancing the books is difficult, bookies will often have a preferred side going into any event.\n\nSo, in the real world, bookies will use some not-so elegant measures to make money. They track their customers betting history, and consistent winners will be limited. Bookies will also use these \"smart\" customers to gauge the market, and may take a lean on a certain side."},

{"title":"Why are presidential election still decided in delegates and not just based on popular vote?","answer":"The key is in this line from the wikipedia entry: \"Each state is allocated as many electors as it has Representatives and Senators in the United States Congress.\"\n\nONLY representatives are apportioned proportionately to population.\n\nSenators are apportioned two to each state.\n\nFor instance, Vermont has 2 senators but only 1 representative.  Thus, they get 3 delegates to the electoral college.\n\nCalifornia, on the other hand, has 2 senators but 53 representatives.  Thus, they get 56 delegates.\n\nAs a result, if the presidential election were decided solely on the basis of population, California would have a 53-to-1 advantage over Vermont.\n\nIf the election were decided solely on the basis of state support, counting only senators, California and Vermont would be equal, at 2-to-2, which obviously helps protect the interests of non-urban states.\n\nThus, the electoral college is a compromise, and gives California an advantage of (53+2)-to-(1+2) over Vermont, which is 55-to-3, or about 18.3-to-1.\n\nSo the point of the electoral college is to protect the interests of minority states, and guarantee that three or four states with huge populations can't automatically gain power over the other 47 states.\n\nGranted, this all sounds theoretical.  I mean, so what if Vermont is trounced 53-to-1 or 18-to-1?  But remember that states like Vermont outnumber states like California, and that this very discrepancy decided the 2000 presidential election.  The constitution achieved its purpose of insuring that a centralized urban constituency did not dominate the nation's politics."},

I understand we have pupils to help control incoming light. Why haven't we developed a camera that can do something similar?

On a good day they can detect a single photon.\n* Our eyes are open for a long period of time, and your brain does a good job of collecting information over that time.  A hand held camera shutter is only open for 1/30th of a second or less, usually.\n* Camera sensors are getting better.  My camera is quite sensitive and is very good at taking photos in dark situations.  For example, [here is a video I took](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lhPZ6n0bj0) in very very dark conditions.

{"title":"ELI5: Why am I hungry before I sleep, don't eat, then wake up not hungry anymore?","answer":"You can get energy mainly from two sources, fat and sugar. After you have eating the body has lots of sugar to enjoy, so it uses that. When you get low on sugar the body needs to switch over too fat for it's energy. This takes some time, and in that window you feel hungry (there are of course other things that can make you hungry as well, and I'll get to that). \n\nWhen you go to bed hungry you are in that window, and your body are switching. When you wake up the switch is complete, and you are happily getting by on fat.\n\nThat's why if you eat a big meal right before bed your aren't finished using up the sugar until the middle of the night. And then you haven't switched completely when you wake up, and you wake up feeling hungry.\n\nBut why do you feel hungry in the morning after a little while? After all, you probably eat breakfast. Well it's simple. It's one of the other reasons we get hungry, timing. You always eat breakfast, so your body is anticipating it and it makes you hungry. If you wanted to (and some people do) you could train yourself to not get hungry around breakfast time, just by not eating it."},

{"title":"ELI5 The situation between Iran and Israel, and how it involves the US","answer":"In the 1940s, Israel was created in the Middle East out of the British colony of Palestine. Many people, mostly Arabs, felt that this was unfair since the Jewish people of Israel had only moved there recently and had stolen their land.\n\nOne country that originally was nice to Israel was Iran. Iran was friendly to Israel because both sides did not like the Arabs very much. Eventually, in 1979, the people of Iran grew angry at the Shah and the United States because they viewed the Shah as a puppet of the US, since the US helped to put the Shah back in power in Operation Ajax. They started a revolution which replaced the Shah with a very religious government.\n\nThis new government does not like Israel or the US very much and to this day says that the Israel government is an occupying force in what should be Palestinian land. Sometimes, very important people in Iran such as the president, claim that they will destroy Israel if at all possible. A problem with this attitude is that Iran has a program which some people say is trying to make atomic bombs, which are very powerful. Many people fear that if Iran gets an atomic bomb, it will be used against Israel first.\n\nIsrael is a friend of the United States and the US does not want to see its friends attacked. Israel does not want to wait to be attacked and wants to attack first so that Iran does not make an atomic bomb. If Israel does attack first, many people think that Iran will attack Israel with anything that they can, which might make the US decide to attack Iran."},

I imagine that would cause chaos but at the same time it seems like a real living fantasy world.","answer":"Different MMORPG games have different rules about that sort of thing.  \n\nMMORPG games are an evolution of MUDs, MUSHs and MOOs.  Did you ever play a game where the location is described to you and you give instructions like 'go east' or 'get stick'?  Imagine if you took an adventure game like that it made it something a lot of people can play at once.  People connect to the game with their own computers and one computer (called the 'server') keeps track of everyone.  People can move around (from 'room' to 'room') and interact with the world or each other by communicating, fighting, looting and exploring.  \nThese games contain bascially four types of things; rooms, players, objects and mobiles.  Rooms are locations in the world, players are the avatars of the people who are playing, objects are items like food and weapons, mobiles are objects that can move from room to room like monsters or animals.  \n\nModern games follow pretty much the same formula except with a lot of fancy features and shiny graphics.  \n\nSince a server can only keep track of so many people at once, there are a lot of tricks people use to chop a games population up into groups.  Sometimes you have a set of servers and people decide which one they want their character to live on.  Sometimes you break up a map into pieces and have a server for each piece.  If the game is a space game, you might have a server for each world or something like that.  \n\nIn most modern MMORPG games you can expect that the population will be split up in some way and that a good portion of the characters you'll meet will be NPCs (non-player characters) which are basically fake people who you can interact with in limited ways (like scripted conversations, trading or combat).

As long as something is moving, something about it is changing or different (even if it's just its location in space).  So we are not really perceiving \"time\", but rather just a change in events from one state to the next.\n\nI think it would also help to imagine what time is not.  If you theoretically could bring everything's temperature down to absolute zero you would cease to have any movement at all, not even vibrations.  Just perfectly still.  If everything cannot move (not just physically, but remember that chemical reactions occur from molecules changing structures, protons, electrons etc) there can be no change.  So if you can define what time is not, essentially the lack of movement or change even at the molecular level, then \"time\" itself becomes the ability for these molecules to move and change.\n\nSince we do not exist at absolute zero, the molecules of our universe are constantly moving and thus constantly changing.  Since everything is constantly moving/changing, our entire universe is based on this movement/change and time governs all aspects around us.\n\nOur definition of \"time\" as a numerical value such as 60 seconds or 1 minute was created so that we can base our observations of these changes we see around us in a system we can keep track of and seems to remain relatively constant all around us.\n\nELI5 attempt:  The whole universe is constantly moving/changing, right down to the tiny pieces (atoms) that make it up.  As long as something is moving, something about it must be changing.  If something is changing, then we can classify it in our system of \"time\" (ex: 60 seconds) as it goes from one state/event to another."},

In the NZ itunes store it was 20 NZD (15.75 AUD), the Australian store it was 19 AUD and in the American store it was 11 USD (10.50 AUD). I would imagine there are significantly more downloads from the Aus and NZ store so why is it so much more expensive. Coincedently I purchased it from the AUS store before checking the US one. I am pissed off, a little because I payed $10 more but more so that I know that the artist wont see that money which is the reason I purchased it in the first place. ","answer":"Prices are set according to how much the people are willing to pay for them.\n\nIf this band is getting significantly more downloads from the Aus and NZ store, then that means Aussies and NZers really want this band. They are willing to spend as much as they can to listen to this band.\n\nIn contrast, maybe the band isn't so well-known in the US. The average American may think about whether he should spend his money on a band he doesn't really know. If it's priced too high, he won't spend, simple. But if the band was big in America and he really liked it, he might be willing to pay twice the original price just to get his hands on that album."},
{"title":"[ELI5] Why music streaming services like 8tracks and Pandora are not \"allowed\" to let you skip more than a X songs per hour?","answer":"IAmTopher is not correct.\n\nThe reason is because of the license agreement they made with the record labels to allow them to stream music in the first place.  Under copyright law, these music services can either be classified as \"interactive\" or \"non-interactive\".  Interactive services allow you to select a song individually.  Spotify is one such example.  Pandora is non-interactive, which meant they had cheaper licensing they had to pay, but more restrictions on how their service could be used.\n\nIf you could rewind, select individual songs, or skip more than a certain number it would violate their license.\n\nSource: American Copyright Association panel earlier today."},
{"title":"ELI5: Foreclosure and Short Selling","question_detail":"My girlfriend's family is looking to buy a house and I'm wondering how the process of foreclosing and short selling how these two processes are different.","answer":"A mortgage is a loan that a bank makes to somebody who wants to buy a house.  This loan is paid little by little, in one bill each month.  But in exchange for the money, the borrower promises two things to the bank:\n\n1. If the borrower can't pay the loan, the bank gets the house.\n2. If the borrower sells the house, they must pay the bank the amount that remains of the loan.\n\nForeclosure is what happens when the borrower can't keep the first promise.  If the borrower cannot pay the loan on time, the bank takes the house.  The bank can then sell it and make up for the money that the borrower wasn't able to pay.\n\nShort sale is when the borrower can't keep the second promise.  The borrower wants to sell the house, but the money they would get from selling the house is less than what they still owe the bank.  In this case, the borrower needs special permission from the bank to sell.  When somebody makes an offer, the seller must ask the bank to give them permission to sell the house for that price.  Most banks are very slow at giving this permission, so the person who made the offer to buy the house often gets sick of waiting and takes back the offer.  And the bank can also say no."},

{"title":"ELI5 Hydrogenation.","question_detail":"This process seems to be applied to many different foods. How harmful are hydrogenated oils to the body? ","answer":"To put it simply, there are two kinds of fat, saturated (bad) and unsaturated (not so bad). The difference between the two is the presence of a double bond, which is on the unsaturated. If you hydrogenate (add hydrogen) an unsaturated fat, it will change the fat to make it appear like it is saturated. Therefore, though they are not bad for you normally, if they are hydrogenated, they are almost as bad as saturated fats. "},
{"title":"ELI5: Supercooling","question_detail":"I saw a video of a beer instantly freezing when being tapped after being in the freezer for a while, can someone explain supercooling like im five?.","answer":"There is a big difference between a cold liquid and a solid. In a liquid, all the molecules (the little bits that make it up) are bouncing around separate from each other. In a solid, the molecules are all connected to each other. In order to change from a liquid to a solid, the molecules have to attach to one another. When a liquid molecule runs into a group of solid molecules, if it's moving slow enough, it will attach to the block, and over time the blocks grow.\n\nIn a \"supercooled\" liquid, the temperature is low enough that the molecules have mostly stopped bouncing around and are ready to connect with one another. But they can't just all attach to each other. If two liquid molecules attach to each other, they're still in the middle of a bunch of liquid molecules, and they'll just get bumped apart again. So they all stay liquid even though they're ready to be solid.\n\nWhat finally causes them to freeze is that they find some other thing to attach to. It could be a crack or bump in the container, or a \"seed\" crystal, or bubbles. It could even be the temporary difference in pressures caused by a noise or tap. Whatever it is, it's a place where molecules can attach to each other without immediately being torn apart by the other molecules. And as soon as enough molecules turn solid, the crystal is too big to be torn apart, so it just keeps growing as more and more molecules bump into it."},

Example: without Net Neutrality, Comcast could intentionally lower all streaming video from Netflix to a very slow rate so that Comcast customers would be forced to stream video from Comcast's video service.  This would drive Netflix out of business, unfairly.\n\nWhile Comcast does not do this, they did recently start offering a video streaming service like Netflix, but said that any movies downloaded from their service would not count against the customer's monthly data limit.  \n\nThere is a debate going on as to whether Comcast's offer violates Net Neutrality.

{"title":"ELI5: What causes that distortion in the air near hot surfaces?","question_detail":"That sort of lensy wavy distortion you notice coming off of pavement on hot days or the back of the engines on air liners.","answer":"There are two things working together to make that happen.\n\nFirst, when air gets hot, it means the molecules are bouncing around faster. Because they're bouncing faster, they push each other away, and the gas expands and gets thinner (that is, there are fewer molecules in the same amount of space; we call this \"density\").\n\nSecond, when light goes from a thinner gas to a thicker one (or vice versa), it changes direction based on the angle of the border between the two gases and the difference in density. So when light goes from a pocket of hot air to \"normal\" air, it can bend a little bit. And that's why things look distorted when you see them through hot air.\n\nIt's basically similar to the reason stuff looks distorted through a glass of water, but of course in that case the water is denser than the air (also the fact that it's water and not just really dense air makes a difference, but that's another story)."},

How do I calculate a value for 'a'? I know enough about programming to see that 'a' might be an array, and that 'n+1' is the position in the array, and that the assigned value of that element in the array is a(n)-th prime. But I still don't know what 'a' is. In short, if someone wrote a BASIC program to generate this list, what would it look like? And no, this isn't for any homework assignment or test. I'm just curious and want to understand the math.","answer":"\"a\" is just a generic name for a sequence. That is, it represents an ordered list of numbers.\n\na(n) refers to the n-th number in the sequence. For example, a(5) is the 5th number in the sequence.\n\nWhat \"a(n+1) = a(n)-th\" means is that the (n+1)th number in the sequence is the number that is the nth prime, if you were to write out a the list of prime numbers in order. \n\nThe terminology here can be kind of confusing. It's easier to do examples. The first 6 numbers in the sequence are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 11, 31.\n\nConsider the 5th number in the sequence. This can be written as a(5), and is 11. What the formula is saying is that a(6), which is 31, must be the 11th prime number.\n\nYou can verify this by writing the prime numbers out in order: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41.\n\nNotice that this holds true. 31 is the 11 prime number, 11 is the 5th prime number, 5 is the 3rd prime number, 3 is the second prime number, 2 is the 1st prime number.\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: Quantum Computing. Please, haha.","answer":"Current computing techniques represent data as a 0 or a 1.\n\nOriginally, when computers were first being developed, scientists tried to make computers that could electronically store ten different levels of charge, from 0 to 9.  This was unreliable, as you needed very high voltages in order to get the correct data.\n\nIn order to accomplish this, they switched over to a binary method of storing data, the aforementioned 0 and 1.  In this method, you are actually storing a voltage within a certain range.  For example, if you have a 5 volt system, your \"0\" may be 0 - 0.5 volts, and your \"1\" may be 4.5 - 5 volts.  This accounts for the real world behavior of electronics and keeps things working reliably.\n\nThe components typically used to stored this data are either flip flops, registers, or tiny capacitors.  Their function is the same; they store an electronic 0 or 1.  \n\nMost of these electronics are built out of things called \"transistors\".  Transistors are essentially an electronic \"switch\", opening or closing.  When you combine lots of these together, you can do arithmetic, or binary operations, and lots of cool things can happen!  As they are open or closed, you can see where the \"0\" and \"1\" come from.\n\nNow to quantum computing:\n\nIn quantum computing, the fundamental component (the transistor in classical computing) is a qubit.  A qubit is very different from a transistor.\n\nA qubit is able to store what is called a \"superposition\" of values.  This essentially means it is able to store information on larger scales than a transistor.\n\nA good way to visualize this is in dimensions.  A transistor stores data one-dimensionally, as a 0 or 1.\n\nA qubit stores data in 2 dimensions (actually visualized as a polar axis, but I'll keep it simple).  This means it can accomplish the task of storing more complex data than \"0\" and \"1\" in a single component.  These two dimensions are \"charge\", the electrical charge of the particles, and \"spin\", the physical spin of the particle.  More complex explanation is out of scope of this lecture ;)\n\nSome scientists have shown that if a large enough computer could be built with qubits, we could solve a lot of our problems, and possibly cause some problems.  A popular example is RSA encryption.  This is the most widely used encryption in the world, and is based on combining two prime numbers.  A quantum computer is able to very efficiently calculate this sort of thing, so a large quantum computer would effectively make this type of encryption useless.\n\nAnother possible application would be simulations of large systems such as weather formations.  The possibilities are endless.\n\nA little more than like you're five, but hopefully you stuck around the wall of text and learned something today :)"},

Often it is expressed with the term \"K=2\", which means \" coverage factor of two\", or more simply, two standard deviations.\n\nSo, with an average of 45, and a coverage factor of two, we are adding two standard deviations to the mean, and subtracting two standard deviations from the mean to get a range that we are confident that 95% of other values in the population will fall into.

Next time you get a song stuck in your head think back, did that song get turned off halfway through?  A lot of the songs getting stuck in our heads are an attempt to complete the musical pattern from before.\n\n2) Incongruity: songs do something unexpected, making themselves memorable.  This goes along with the previous in that it 'breaks' an understood pattern, causing us to give it more attention.  \n\n3) Repetition: any time a song on the radio gets stuck in your head, this could be the cause. \n\n4) Simplicity: simple songs are remembered easier.

If you live in a pleasantly temporate area with few natural catastrophes or hardships and no serious predators, you have more freedom to advance technologically and intellectually. If you have to walk two hours to get a jug of water and are always in danger of being eaten by lions, technological advancement is obviously hindered. They can't grow crops or keep livestock as effectively as people in more forgiving regions, so they struggle more for survival and can devote less time and effort to progress. Adding to this problem, countries near the equator have typically been exploited for their resources and are now held back by the resulting conflicts.

I would have uploaded this to /r/Technology but they don't allow pics. If someone could help I would be eternally grateful!","answer":"This is pretty much the cheapest, most foolproof method you will find for using those speakers with your computer. Like others said, you'll need an amplifier. [Here](http://www.amazon.com/Lepai-Tripath-Class-T-Amplifier-Supply/dp/B0049P6OTI/ref=pd_ybh_11) is one for ~$25. This will take the sound from your headphone port and amplify it such that it can play over your speakers. \n\nTo connect it to your speakers just match the colors. There are plugs on the back of this amplifier that look like the ones on the backs of your speakers. It's pretty simple, just take the wire connected to the red port on the back of a speaker and connect it to the red port on the back of amplifier. Do the same for the black port and then repeat for the other speaker. \n\nAs far as connecting it to your computer, there is a headphone port on the back just like there is on your computer. There are also the standard [RCA audio connectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCA_connector). You can connect with either, but I recommend using the RCA connector with an [adapter](http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Audio-Cable-Splitter-1-Mini/dp/B00004Z5CP/ref=pd_cp_e_3) for a standard headphone port.

If this seems patronizing, then you probably aren't really five. :-)\n\nImagine Susie opens a lemonade stand. She sets it up like this: In order to buy the lemons, and the sugar, and the magic marker to make her sign, she offers all the kids a chance to share in owning her stand. Anyone can buy 1/20th of it a buck. She is going to sell 10 shares, each worth a tenth of her whole business, for a dollar apiece. She will then keep the other ten shares.\n\nSusie gets out her notebook and writes 20 \"ownership\" certificates and signs each one. she keeps half of them for herself, then sells the rest to kids for a dollar apiece.\n\n(Please be aware that each share of the lemonade stand is *indivisible* - it's 1/20th of everything all at once;  not, say, three lemons and the stirring spoon.  )\n\nA few days later and Susie's stand is doing great. But now Jimmy wants to go buy some Nerds and he needs his dollar back.  He offers to sell his share back to Susie. She declines the offer. Jenny says she will buy it for a dollar, though - she wouldn't mind owning two shares instead of one, and has a dollar in her pocket.\n\nHowever, Rudy overhears. He likes how Susie makes her lemonade and was absent the day she sold the shares. He wants in on the business. So he offers Jimmy $2 for his certificate.  Jenny counters with $2.50; Rudy ups his offer to $3, and buys Jimmy's share.\n\nOver the two weeks, Susie's lemonade stand does very well. Everybody wants to own a piece of the business. Shares are hard to come by, as nobody seems to want to sell. But if a buyer offers enough, even a reluctant seller will be found.  Jordan buys a share from Jenny (who now owns three) for $6.\n\nThen people begin to notice that Susie's sales are slipping.  It's getting colder. Fall is coming. Nobody wants lemonade. People start to think that maybe the lemonade train has passed. When Timmy wants to sell a share he bought for $4 the best he can get for it is $2. A week later, Bobbi can't find a buyer for her share for even a dollar. And Jordan, unhappy child, sells her share for 50 cents, a loss of $5.50.\n\nThis little illustration didn't touch on stock splits or dividends, but I think it covers the basic reason prices go up or down. But keep in mind, the real stock market is not a perfect playground. Stocks may move for irrational reasons - deceit and fraud, rumors and manic speculation among them. Good stocks will decline in a falling market, and bad stocks will rise during a bubble.\n\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: Both sides of the Trayvon Martin case","answer":"**In favor of Zimmerman:** George Zimmerman is unemployed and wants to do a community watch. He carries a gun and has gotten to know most of the people in the gated community. George Zimmerman likes the community and the community likes him. George doesn't like the fact that the housing crisis has allowed his high status gated community to allow people to move in that are not the high status people that had complained about the average man. Because some of these lower status people moved in, some other undesirable people began to move freely about the gated community. \n\nZimmerman began to be proactive in his community watch. He even stopped a couple of potential burglaries. He reported everything he did to the 911 dispatcher. \n\nOne night a kid is walking through the neighborhood. A kid that Zimmerman did not know. Zimmerman thinks the kid is acting suspicious and calls 911, Zimmerman begins to follow the kid. The kid makes a threatening move and Zimmerman does not feel safe. Under Florida law, Zimmerman feels he can safely shoot the kid to defend himself. \n\n**The Trayvon Martin side:** Martin was a kid. Not a great kid, but a good one. Like all 17 year old children, he may not have had a lot of common sense. He walked through his gated community one evening on his way to buy Skittles and soft drinks. When he came back into his community, he was approached by Zimmerman. What happened next can only be assumed from the 911 calls and the reports of Zimmerman, but having been a young man in an area of proactive patrolling, I can guess what happened next. *WILD SPECULATION FOLLOWS* \n\nZimmerman had been stopped on several occasions and had to explain what he was doing in the neighborhood that he lived in. It wasn't that he was black. It was that he was young, he was black, he was wearing a hoodie, and goddammit, we have to have some way to identify the criminals in our neighborhood. \n\nWell, if you ever get stopped everyday for doing what you are allowed to do, you tend to get pissed. If Martin was past 30 years old, no one would question why he was in the neighborhood. If Martin was wearing a polo and walking a dog, he wouldn't have been questioned. But because he was young and black and looking like you would like a criminal to look, he was approached by Zimmerman. \n\nWhat happened next was irrelevant. Somehow Zimmerman approached Martin and a confrontation ensued. The end result is that a young man got killed. \n\nFinal argument for each side: Zimmerman should not have been carrying a gun. He had been told not to do this. Zimmerman should not have followed Martin. He had been told not to do this. Zimmerman was also an adult and should have had the common sense that most adults are assumed to have. \n\nMartin, being a kid, should have stopped and said something like, \"Yes, sir, I live here. I have nothing more dangerous than Skittles and a 7-Up, then waited on the curb until the cops showed up. "},

You'll feel the wind pushing it not only back, but up as well. This is because air is bouncing off of it and getting pushed down a bit (which thus pushes your hand up).

{"title":"ELI5: Computer processor. How do I compare dualcore to quadcore? For example, is 2GHz dualcore equivalent to 1GHz quadcore?","question_detail":"Something just doesn't seem right about straight multiplication.","answer":"In theory a quad core CPU permits four instructions to be executed for each cycle of the clock (for a 2.6GHz processor, 1/2,600,000,000th of a second). In practice though, that doesn't mean quite the same thing as your computer suddenly being able to play TF2 four times faster than a single core 2.6GHz system. \n\nIn an effort to keep this at five year old level, I'll try to avoid a discussion of the specific coordination techniques like semaphors and threads and such, but suffice it to say that computer programs are comprised largely of branching decisions, and upon reaching one of these decision points the program must have all the information necessary to make the decision or wait, it cannot go any further in an ambiguous state. Consequently, a program that wasn't written in or isn't suited for a non-linear execution style called parallelization cannot make good use of multiple core environments. Even in highly parallelized applications, a surprisingly substantial processing overhead is incurred by the program and operating system \"keeping track\" of the various threads, so it's never perfectly efficient. \n\nLuckily, modern OSes are multitasking, that is to say that they let you run more than one program at once (and it wasn't always so - DOS is not a true multitasking environment). Multiple cores are reasonably good at this: since each running program mostly only needs to know its own information to go on to the next step in it's flow, four different programs can usually each take one step for each cycle of the clock. So moving from one core to four of the same speed (and instruction set, etc.) won't feel so much like you are running one program four times as fast, but in general like you're able to run more programs at once."},

How do you program music players to read mp3 files?  What the fuck is CSS? Java? How do these languages break down?\n\nI know I'm on Reddit here, so I apologize for my ignorance regarding the subject matter","answer":"&gt; How is a program like Google's Chrome browser programmed in such a way that it allows extensions to be written by users and integrated right into the browser?\n\nI don't know how most Chrome extensions interact, but the obvious way that many simple ones do is simply by applying custom javascript. In case you don't know already, javascript is a language that makes it easy to program behaviour based on the page contents. For instance, a couple of lines of javascript applied to a page could make the images on that page float around the browser. Since javascript is a massive part of the modern web, browsers all have superb support for it, so it's easy to write extensions just by writing javascript and applying it on top of what the web pages automatically have.\n\n&gt; How do you program music players to read mp3 files?\n\nAgain, I don't know the specifics of the format, but sound is just a set of times and amplitudes (or equally well represented by frequencies and amplitudes). The mp3 format is set way of writing these down in a well documented way. The act of reading it is just the act of reading the numbers in the file and looking up what they mean in the specification. You can then send the right sound amplitudes to the OS audio device.\n\nOf course, in real life you wouldn't reimplement the wheel to read mp3s, but instead probably use an existing library that provides a simple interface whilst handling everything you need behind the scenes.\n\n&gt; What the fuck is CSS?\n\nCascading Style Sheets. Web pages are written in the markup language HTML, which essentially means you write plain text surrounded with instructions about how to format it. For instance, '&lt;b&gt;foo&lt;/b&gt; bar' would normally look like ' **foo** bar'.\n\nCSS is the part that tells the viewer exactly how text of each type should be formatted. For instance, text might be marked as title text and so would be expected to be large and perhaps bold, but the CSS instructions would specify exactly what 'title' text should look like. How big? What font? What colour?\n\nThis means that web page appearance can vary dramatically by just changing the CSS. To illustrate how powerful it is, the website [cssZenGarden](http://www.csszengarden.com/) lets you choose from different CSS designs. Whilst the website content stays the same, its appearance changes dramatically.\n\n&gt; Java?\n\nA popular programming language, higher level than C, but relatively low level compared to more modern popular languages.

But don't feel that this is the sole defining feature of the language, it's just a big one.\n\n&gt; How do these languages break down?\n\nThis is a massive topic in itself.

What is the main criteria? ","answer":"The diatonic scale pattern is this: whole step, whole step, half step, whole step, whole step, whole step, half step. A whole step is when you go from one note to the next, skipping a tone in between. (Say, C to D while skipping C#... if you're looking at a piano keyboard, skipping the black key in between the two white ones.) C-Major is the only major key where you can do this without hitting any sharps or flats... there is no E-sharp (the first 'half-step') nor B-sharp (the second one). \n\nIf you shift to its related minor key (A-Minor) then you play from A to the next A without hitting any sharps (or black keys), since C-Major doesn't have any. But A-Major is supposed to have those... the first whole-step goes from A to B, and the second goes from B to C-Sharp (since there is no 'B-Sharp). So it makes the scale sound 'minor.'

{"title":"ELI5: Facebook's value","question_detail":"I saw on another post today that Facebook is currently valued at over $100 billion. Last year, Facebook had $1 billion in profits. I understand there's a difference between value and revenue, but can someone explain to me how a company can be \"worth\" over 100 times their actual demonstrative value? Surely people's personal information can't be worth *that* much?","answer":"There are several different ways to value a company. I'll go into the ones that are used for Facebook.\n\nOne way they valued facebook was by **comparable transaction analysis**. What this means is they compare facebook to similar companies. \n\nAll of these companies have financial statements and people come up with different ratios. Price to Earnings, Debt to Equity, Enterprise Value to Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization, etc. All that matters is that there are ratios that go with a company's financial statements. Once banks and financial analyst obtain all these numbers, they compare it to a universe of similar companies. For example, facebook and google both make most of their money from online advertisement revenue.\n\nWith a group of similar companies, they can compare the ratios and place a value on facebook based on the value of the other companies. (Sidenote: the value of other companies is considered the Market Capitalization. Which is the share price of a company multiplied by the number of shares. This is an already established number).\n\n**Pro**: Since this compares similar companies, the free market has already placed a value of those type of companies. Therefore is a good indicator of what facebook is worth.\n\n**Con**: It ignores strengths facebook may have over other companies. \n\nThe other way that was used is by **Discounted Cash Flows**. \n\nFacebook made $1Billion in profits last year. That's fine, but we don't care too much about past profit, we care about future profit. We expect facebook to find new ways to generate even more revenue in the future. What is the value of all of those future cash flows \"discounted\" to today's worth? It was decided that all futures cash flows of facebook are worth $100 Billion today.\n\n**Pro**: It takes a look at the earnings and expenses of facebook.\n\n**Cons**: Difficult to predict future earnings, and it ignores current market conditions.\n\n**How Facebook got it's $100 Billion Valuation**\n\nInvestment Banks are the ones that declare the value of a company. Facebook used several different banks to try to value the company. They decided that based on all the information they had, facebook was worth $100 Billion. Now, it may seem attractive for the banks to just say a really high number but that is not always true. What happens is that they buy all the stocks facebook was going to sell for a small discount. They then go and try to sell those to investors. If they can't sell them then they lose money.\n\n**Why that figure isn't ridiculous**\n\nBack when Google first went Public, they were valued at $30Billion. From a revenue standpoint they were in a similar position to Facebook. When the stocks went public, the share price tripled very quickly making them worth $90 Billion.\n\n\n\n"},

What has all of these awesome websites, when I turn my computer and it connects to the modem, where does it go after that?","answer":"The internet is a global network of computers, most of them are computers like yours, or maybe a phone, tablet or some other device. These are mainly used to visit websites and sometimes to send data to them. Then there are servers, computers that solely exist to provide services. Most of them are web servers, when you visit a website your computer is actually connecting to this other computer (the server) and downloading a number of files which are decoded by your browser. The server will probably spend all day sending files out to hundreds or thousands of people, sometimes all at the same time. Sites that are very popular will have server farms, that might have hundreds or thousands of servers because one server can only deal with so many people at once (this is called traffic)\n\nThere are other servers, not just web-servers but the principle is the same, their job is to handle a lot of data"},

This is useful because it allows the heart to regulate itself without having to depend on external stimuli.\n\nAccording to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank%E2%80%93Starling_law_of_the_heart), the extra blood causes the cardiac muscle fibers to stretch:\n\n&gt;The stretching of the muscle fibers augments cardiac muscle contraction by increasing the affinity of troponin C for calcium, causing a greater number of actin-myosin cross-bridges to form within the muscle fibers.\n\n...which increases the contraction force."},
{"title":"ELI5: What the Federal Reserve Bank is? A US nationalized system that oversees the American economy? Is that righT?","answer":"The Federal Reserve is essentially the Bank of the United States, a lender of last resort - essentially a bank of banks. It requires consumer banks to have a certain percentage of their deposits held at the regional Federal Reserve bank. It also supplies credit to banks at a set interest rate. And it manages the supply of US dollars in circulation. In this way the Federal Reserve can increase or decrease the amount of credit in the economy, by changing the money supply and the cost of money. The Federal Reserve does not oversees the money/credit supply, which then influences the economy. But it does not oversee the economy directly.\n\nAlthough the Federal Reserve has a public board, it is a private bank owned by its member banks. Its primary goal is to maintain the integrity of the US banking system."},
{"title":"ELI5: Why are upload speeds vastly inferior to download speeds.","answer":"Think of a broadband connection like an 8-lane road.  Normally, you split it 50/50 and as many cars can go one way as go the other.  For a major freeway coming and out of a city, during rush hour, you might want to have 6 lanes going one way and 2 going the other.\n\nSince most home use is primarily downloading (streaming videos, viewing web pages, etc), it makes sense to use more of your \"lanes\" to download.

How does this stuff work and are there any better ways of dealing with it?","answer":"Water gets hot, evaporates and becomes water vapour. The water vapour hits the cold glass and becomes water again, forming that misty condensation.\n\nThe best way to prevent it is to keep the windows warm. Does your car have a blower? Mine has a blower and a window option. I put oth of them on and direct it at the window and there's barely any.\n\nIt makes the car really warm but shit sucks, it has to happen. On particularly warm days you shouldn't be getting condensation anyway."},
{"title":"ELI5: the MLB standings format.","question_detail":"Mainly, how is it determined at the end of the season which teams will enter the postseason?","answer":"The format was changed starting this year.  The way it works is that the MLB is divided into 2 leagues, the American League and the National League.  Each of these 2 leagues has 5 of its teams participate in that league's playoffs.  The winner of the American League plays the winner of the National League in the championship series. \n\nEach league is divided into 3 divisions, East, Central, and West.  Teams play a disproportionate number of games against the other teams in the same division.  At the end of the year, every team has played the same number of games.  The more wins and fewer losses a team has, the better its record.  At this point, each division has its best team declared a playoff participant (based on the team with the best record).  Next comes \"wild card\" teams.  These are the 2 teams in each league that had the best records among the teams that did not win their division.  So, each league has 5 playoff contenders: 3 division winners and 2 wild cards. \n\nThe first round of the playoffs features a single game between the 2 wild cards in each league.  Whoever wins that game advances to the next round.\n\nThe second round features the advancing wild card team against the division winner with the league's best record.  Meanwhile, the other 2 division winners play each other.  This is a best-of-5 series, meaning that teams play up to 5 games and the first team to get 3 wins moves on to the next round.\n\nThe third round, or league championship round, features a best-of-7 series between the 2 teams in each league that won in the last round.\n\nThe final round is called the World Series.  It's a best-of-7 series between the only team that avoided elimination in the American League playoffs and the only team that avoided elimination in the National League playoffs.  The winner of this series is declared the champion. "},

What are the effects? [The new bottle](http://i.imgur.com/aoFw7.jpg?1)","answer":"Well the way I see it is that sometimes when a grown up wants you to buy something that will say something about it that isn't a lie but doesn't really mean anything. They often use words from science or technology to make it sound like they know what they are talking about, but really it's just what they call 'fluff', for example If I were selling sunglasses I might tell you they were 'HD' and you would think that you can see better with them, but really 'HD' doesn't mean anything when it comes to sunglasses. When something is 'Bio Active' it means that it can effect living things, so calling something 'Bio Activated' might make you think it has something in it that somehow makes you better at sports or something because you are a living thing. The advantage the person selling the thing has is that because the words don't really mean anything you can't go and tell a policeman that the seller lied to you about it to get you to buy it. The good thing is that you're only five and asking these questions, some people never realize there's something funny going on."},

{"title":"ELI5: The rationale behind not vaccinating children","answer":"To go a bit deeper than the whole autism scare thing, it's basically a free rider problem. Because the overwhelming majority of people get the MMR vaccine, for instance, the disease is virtually non-existent in the US. It's very, very unlikely that an unvaccinated person would catch measles. This is called \"herd immunity.\"\n\nThere ARE very small health risks associated with vaccines (though not autism). For example, in a small number of people, the small pox vaccine caused serious reactions. From an individual's perspective, if the risks of contracting the disease are lower than the risk of vaccination, it makes sense not to get vaccinated.\n\nBUT that's a really shitty way to think about, because your basically banking on everyone else taking the gamble for you.

Can someone please explain these or any other commonly touted \"statistics\" that we here abou the lottery?","answer":"If you don't buy a ticket, you have a 0% chance of winning. If you buy one ticket, and there are 20 million other tickets sold, you have a 1 in 20 million chance. That may seem small but it's infinitely bigger than zero.\n\nNow say you buy two tickets. You have a 2 in 20 million chance of winning. This raises your chances by 0.0000005%. Buy as many tickets as you want, each one only raises your chances by that much.\n\nYou can see that if you bought 5 million more tickets (making the total 25 million) your odds would be 1 in 5, or 20%. If each ticket was $1 and the jackpot was simply the total, your odds would be 1 in 5 that you'll make a 500% profit. If you bought 20 million tickets, your odds would be 1 to 1 that youll make a 100% profit. That's better than any game in Vegas.\n\nObviously that's not how it works for many reasons, first of all because you'd have to have that much in the first place, but just as importantly, the jackpot is nowhere near the total of all ticket sales. Something like 40% (at least in my state) goes to parks, outdoor areas, streets, non-profit grants, etc. Plus there are prizes for second place winners, and multiple jackpots split the prize. All of these things reduce your odds greatly.\n\nIt's also been mentione that the sheer logistics of buying, keeping track, sorting, and identifying that many tickets is highly implausible. You could hire hundreds of people to help you, but then you'd still have to pay them even if you lose.\n\nLong story short, there is no way to play the lottery in a way that makes mathematical sense. You have a much higher chance of winning in a casino."},

Why not just say, \"are you a cop\" before or after anything illegal comes into play, like teaching yourself to thoughtlessly say \"excuse me\" when pushing through a crowd?\n\n\nI guess I'm just looking for a broad explanation of the term, just less muddied by complex legal jargon.","answer":"Would the person have been able and willing to commit the crime had law enforcement not been involved?  If not, it is entrapment.\n\nThere are two legal tests for entrapment.  One is the subjective test, \"would this particular person been predisposed to commit the crime?\"  The other is the objective test, \"Is law enforcement's conduct such that an average law abiding person would have been tempted?\"\n\nSo lying alone is not entrapment.

Government, run by a very smart president named Herbert Hoover, who understood economic theory very well, tried doing nothing, then tried helping the banks, but the economy didn't get better.\n\nIn 1933, FDR took over; he had no patience for economic theory, and was willing to just do trial and error (which is actually far more scientific than most economic theory, but that's a different post).\n\nSo if he saw a problem, he (or sometimes Congress on its own) thought up a way to fix it and tried it.\n\nMany of his early tries failed.\n\nHere are some of the solutions that lasted:\n\nProblem: Unemployment. Solution: Unemployment insurance and public works.\n\nProblem: People who couldn't work had no income (even old people who'd saved had been wiped out in the 1929 crash and its aftermath). Solution: Social Security, disability payments, etc.\n\nProblem: Banks failing left and right. Solution: Insuring bank deposits with the FDIC (in exchange for the insurance, banks had to invest the money soberly).\n\nProblem: Wall Street was full of corrupt idiots who had to be watched every minute.

{"title":"ELI5: Why is Pierre Trudeau such a bone of contention with Canadians?? What is the controversy about?","answer":"Some Canadians love Trudeau, whereas others absolutely dislike him. Your position on the matter will depend on what part of the country you're from, and your politics regarding what Canadian society should be. Three major policy positions created this divide. \n\nThe first concerns **oil in Alberta**. In the 1970s, oil prices shot up due to wars in the Middle East. Understanding that Canada has oil reserves, he expanded government control of oil in Alberta to reduce oil prices across the country, redistribute the oil wealth across Canada, and secure Canada's oil reserves. *Why did this create a divide between Albertans and other Canadians?* It depends who you think the oil \"belongs to\". Is it a Canadian resource, or an Albertan resource? Many Albertans, including the private Albertan oil companies, believed it was their wealth, whereas other Canadians believed it should be a shared national commodity. There's *a lot* of money involved with this policy, and when people see how much money *they could've had*, it boils their blood. The policy was ended, and today Alberta is the richest province in Canada. **The result: many Albertans don't like him.**\n\nThe second was the **Quebec issue**. Trudeau was a federalist, meaning he was Canadian before a Quebecois. That meant he was against Quebec sovereignty, and became one of the strongest voices of opposition. 30% voted for sovereignty, which means that 1/3 of Quebecois at that time were anti-Trudeau, clarifying where a lot of resentment against Trudeau comes from in Quebec. In 1995, half of Quebecois voted for sovereignty. Today, sovereignty is no longer an issue. **The result: many Quebecois don't like him.**\n\nThe third was **multiculturalism policy**. This didn't anger Albertans, or Quebecers, but traditionalists and those who only wanted Canadian or Quebec society to be built on one language. Traditionalists didn't like it because it gives recognition to other cultures aside from traditional 'Canadian' values (which for many includes Christian values). This divide sprouted up again after the niqab debate. The Anglophones didn't like it because it made French visible everywhere. Although his Official Languages Act didn't force your child to learn French in school, all traffic signs and labelling had to also be in French. This further angered Francophones who believed French was under threat, as Quebec labelling also now had to be in English. **The result: traditionalists and many conservatives despise him, and many unilingual people dislike him.** \n\n**TL;DR: He angered Albertans because he wanted to distribute the oil wealth across Canada. He angered Quebec nationalists because he was the biggest voice against them. He angered traditionalists by opening Canada up to other cultures. And he angered people who only wanted to read one language in their day-to-day lives with his bilingualism policy.**"},

{"title":"How does an individual type of currency vary in value over time?","question_detail":"You know, like \"the value of the US$ has decreased in value by 30% since 1870.\" What factors into the change in value, and how does it affect the economy?","answer":"The value of the US dollar has decreased by about 95% since 1913.\n\nThere are 2 ways a currency can decrease in value.\n\nOne is that more and more people stop using the currency.  Suppose most people stopped using dollars and they started using Euros.  If I was going to sell my car, I would not want to sell it for dollars, because it would be hard for me to use those dollars because no one else is selling things for dollars.  In this scenario, the dollar has lost its value.\n\nThe other way a currency loses value is when people print more and more of it.  The amount of a currency all by itself doesn't mean much.  The amount you have in relationship to the total amount available is what matters.  So if there were only $10 in the entire U.S. and you had 5 of them, then you would have half of the entire wealth of the United States.  Now, if another $90 gets printed out of thin air, there becomes a total of $100 in the U.S.  Now you no longer have half of the wealth, you have only 10%.  So as more of the currency gets printed, the amount you have becomes worth less and less.  This is called inflation.  In the U.S. the Federal Reserve is responsible for printing more dollars."},

{"title":"ELI5 Chaos Theory","answer":"inc114 is mostly right, but maybe in simpler terms:\n\nSay you have a mountain separating two valleys.  If you place a boulder somewhere on the mountain, you can usually predict where it will end up.  If you place the boulder on the left side of the mountain, it'll end up at the bottom of the left valley.  If you place the boulder on the right side, it'll end up at the bottom of the right valley.  That's classic determinism.  \n\nBut what if you put the boulder on the tip of the mountain?  Well, if you do it several times you can see that it'll sometimes end up in the left valley, sometimes in the right valley.  It looks random.  Chaos theory proposes that it isn't random: it is entirely determined by the exact position of the boulder, the shape of the contact area between boulder and mountain, etc.  The idea is that if you change these, even just a little, in a way that you can't even see with your eyes, it can make the difference between left and right.\n\nIt is not random, but it is due to such small changes in the initial conditions that it looks random: it's chaotic.  \n\nOf course this is a very simple system with only two possible outcomes.  Chaotic systems often have infinite possible outcomes, such as the weather in the world.\n"},

It's squeezed very tightly and is so hot that it jiggles very fast. Atoms generally bounce of each other, but when they hit each other very hard, then they fuse into helium.\n\nWhen atoms fuse, they get cooler and jiggle a little less, but they also heat everything around them and shine a bit. \n\nBecause Sun is so hot and so big, these fusions happen constantly and help with creating more fusions. \n\nNow solar flares and plasma. \n\nPlasma happens when gas is so hot, that electrons have hard time hanging onto atoms. Atoms without electrons have positive charge. When you put a charged particle in a magnetic field, it will strongly react with it.\n\n Sun has a fairly chaotic magnetic field, so sometimes it'll accelerate enough plasma to make solar flare. "},

{"title":"ELI5 General Relativity ","question_detail":"Mostly just the basic concept of it but if you can, add anything that is  more complex. I have been reading about it but just want to make sure I understand the big picture of it.","answer":"First of all, do you know there is a difference between **Special Relativity** and **General Relativity**?\n\nTo get you started here is a long explanation about **Special Relativity**\n\nKeep in mind, no matter what, no matter who, no matter where, no \nmatter when... everyone who measures the speed of light will get the \nsame answer as everyone else all the time. This is an experimental \nfact first observed in the late 1880s and tested over and over again \nand again. It is a fundamental law of physics...everyone measures the \nspeed of light to be the same.\n\nEverything that happens in Relativity derives from this fact. You have to live it, breathe it, know it, own it. \n\nNow imagine you are watching a pulsing light off in the distance... *pulse...pulse...pulse...* You notice that the light travels some fixed distance c between each pulse. You call the time between each pulse 1 \nand you figure that the speed of light is distance/time = c/1 = c. So \nyou measure the speed of light to be c.\n\nNow you know if you ever measure the speed again it will be c, no \nmatter what. Now you start moving toward the pulses. What do you \nnotice? Well, the pulses are coming faster and faster because you are \nrunning into them as they approach.\n\nWhy? Well, the light moves a certain distance between pulses, the pulses \nare coming faster... the pulses are like baseballs being thrown at you... \nthey are pelting you *......pelt......pelt.....pelt.* What happens if \nyou start moving toward the pelts? If you are hit once every second, \nbut it takes a long time for the baseballs to get to you, like 10 \nseconds... that must mean there are like 10 balls in the air on their \nway toward you at any given moment...pelt..pelt..pelt they are hitting \nyou quicker and quicker.\n\nIf your friend is pelting you and you are hit once every second, but \nit takes a long time for the baseballs to get to you, perhaps like 10 \nseconds... that must mean there are like 10 balls in the air on their \nway toward you at any given moment.\n\nNow suddenly you rush your friend and you get there in like one \nsecond.. what happens in that one second? You get hit by all 10 balls \n*...pelt pelt pelt* 10 times in one second, not once a second. Now with \nthe baseballs, if you measured the speed you would measure them to be \ngoing faster and faster, that does not happen with the light so the \nway you measure time and distance must be changing but the speed of \nlight did not change. So what changed? \n\nThe distance must be shorter, but if the distance is shorter it must mean the light is not moving as much. BUT it cannot be slower... how does light move less without slowing down? The light moves for less time. So your time must be slowing down.\n\ntl;dr lThe only way everyone measures light to be the same speed is if time \nslows down and distances get shorter as they move faster and faster."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why the sky is blue","question_detail":"I've never really listened to anyone explain it.","answer":"Air is a blue substance like a blue opal:  it scatters the short (blue/violet) end of the spectrum.   Air is also red/orange like an opal.   If you look through air at very distant light sources, those beams will appear red since they had their blue light scattered off to the side.\n\nOr more visual...\n\nSay you had a giant blob of air far out in space.  Giant = hundred miles across.  (Surround it with a plastic bag so it doesn't just disperse.)  Now if the sun is shining on it, it appears bright blue!  It scatters the blue/violet light to your eyes, while the red-orange light just continues on through.   But the stars behind it appear red.   Now pour your giant bag of air out onto the surface of a planet.  Anyone on the surface will be looking up through a sunlit layer of blue air.   But during sunsets they'd think the air is a red substance.\n\nOK, so is air a blue substance, or is it red?  The answer is yes.  :)  The color of the air depends on the angles of view and illumination.  \n\nAnd no, air is not actually transparent.   If it were, then the daytime sky would be just as black as the sky on the moon, and sunsets would be just as white as the midday sun.\n\nBesides air and opals, there are other materials which contain no blue dyes, but they still appear blue to the eye.  Bluejay feathers do this.  So does [aerogel](http://p25ext.lanl.gov/~hubert/aerogel/aerogel_1.gif).  So does smoke in a dark room.

{"title":"ELI5: What is mitochondrial DNA and what it tells about human evolution","answer":"Your DNA comes from both your parents. You have half from your dad and half from your mum.  By the same reasoning, you have 4 grandparents, so you have a quarter of your dna supplied by each of your 4 grandparents. 1/8th from each of your your great grandparents.  It doesn't take many generations before you can go back to a person in your immediate family linage who is no more genetically related to you than a stranger on the street.  Tracing human evolution in this way has a strength and a major weakness for this reason.\n\nImagine we cloned a person based you, umm.. you!  We do it when you are about 30 years old.  They grow up normally, and when they are 30 we clone them again.  Each new generation of you survives the last generation almost like a regular family tree.  The \"son\" of your \"son\" is cloned through many generations, each on almost identical in DNA.  \"Almost\" because DNA mutations still occur.  The cloning process is not perfect, and the odd error gets through.  These errors are usually not a big deal, but since we are cloning the clones of a clone, any mutation is passed on to the next person.  After 10,000 cloned generations, we can look at the dna sequence and compare it to the original (because in my example I still know what the original sequence was) and we can see, lets say, 5 errors.  5 errors in 10,000 generations: we can almost use that as a method of measurement.  \n\nIf my clone has 4 out of the 5 errors of your clone, it suggests that our clones came from the same linage.  It also suggest that the split from the linage was about 1/5 * 10000 generations ago (2000 generations ago).  Someone else has a clone who has 3 out of the 5 errors that your clone has, so it was split off the linage about 4000 generations ago.  I won't go on, but there are some groovy math/stats things you can do with this information.\n\nIf only we had some cloned dna in our cells.  Wait a minute, we DO!  Inside each of your cells is an organelle called a mitochondria.  It has it's OWN dna!  It's not a combination of your mum and dad's, it's a clone of your mums!  We can use this dna sequence just like in the clone example.  Not only that but we can see that almost every living thing on the planet has mitochondria, we can see the genetic distance between everything on the planet.

Put each in a separate bowl and notice which melts faster.

When you are in a corporation, particularly a large one, it is easy to accept some things as \"true\" just because every one around you does, or because people who don't accept them are treated badly.  Microsoft has likely generated a long list of requirements that IE must meet, and the development team is required to implement those requirements. Even if some of those requirements are things that make users unhappy.     \n  \nSimilarly, they have developed systems  of acceptance, testing, user interface, etc. over many generations of IE.  These are \"how it is done properly\", and have become part of the culture, even though they may result in a product that many users despise. \n  \nIn addition, their view of IE is probably that it is very successful, because empirical data shows that it has many users.  There are logical reasons why that might not be a good metric, but pushing a different metric would probably not make you very popular within Microsoft.   \n  \nThey likely also have data showing that among the people who regularly use IE, most of them are satisfied with it. There's also an obvious flaw with this....the dissatisfied people no longer use it.  \n  \nFinally, IE is given away free with Windows.

{"title":"How exactly does stagflation occur?","answer":"Inflation is when prices in general go up. Now, if one 7-11 raises the price of Slurpees, that isn't necessarily inflation. But if all gas stations raise the price of slurpees, and gas, and hot dogs, and things are *generally more expensive*, that's inflation. Usually this happens because customers have money, and people want more hot dogs and things than there are. The price goes up because people are willing to pay more for them. This isn't a bad thing, and it usually happens because lots of people have jobs and have money to spend. A little inflation is normal.\n\nIt can also happen for other reasons. Stagflation is a bad kind of inflation. It happens when there's not enough of something important, like oil. Oil is used for many, many things, so if there's suddenly very little oil, companies can't make as much stuff. If companies can't make as much stuff, they have to fire workers. When people don't have jobs, they have less money. The people who do have money are spending more to get the stuff, so the stuff becomes more expensive.\n\nSo now there are a lot of people with not much money, and stuff is more expensive than before. Companies have a hard time making enough stuff with less money, so stagflation is very hard to get out of.\n\n[Here's an article from Simple Wikipedia](http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagflation)."},

{"title":"ELI5 What big franchises/retail corporations do with their individual store's money","question_detail":"I don't know why I've been thinking about this a lot lately. I've never been a very savvy financial and business person, so the whole process fascinates me.\n\nSo let's take a place like WalMart, or Target. Obviously these companies make so much money they're essentially printing it. But what happens after I give my money to the Mesa Riverview WalMart, or the In-N-Out Burger down the road? How do the big guys get the money from the individual places?\n\nAnd where do they keep it? WalMart must make an insane amount of gross intake a day, right? So do they just have a giant bank account with millions of dollars sitting in it that they use to fund payroll, operating costs, etc? Or do the individual stores maintain accounts to pay their own stuff?","answer":"What happens is the local Wal-Mart has a local bank account. The cash collected through the day makes its way to the bank the following day after the receipts have been checked against the money taken in. The cash gets to the bank and stays in the local bank until once a month, it is electronically transferred to a Regional Financial Officer, or a budgeting secretary. The money is now in the Regional Financial Officer's account where it get combined with the money from the other stores in the region. \n\nThere may be several levels of regional managers, and with Wal-Mart being an international corporation, there will even be international regions. Either way, there will be a schedule for when the next higher level financial officer gets briefed on the money taken in. At some point, a financial report is given to the chief financial officer. The CFO takes the numbers off the piece of paper and the other chiefs try to get their share of the numbers. \n\nSo, cash is brought to a local bank. From that point on, the money is only numbers on a spreadsheet, but the money is lumped together for accounting purposes. At least that's how it worked when I was in management for a Target like store. "},

{"title":"[American politics] What exactly is a brokered convention, and what instances or near-instances has that happened in history?","question_detail":"The news seems to talk about it every four years but I've yet to see it happen.","answer":"At the national convention for a political party (such as the Republican party) there are delegates that vote on who should be the nominee for President.  The delegates are chosen through a Primary/Caucus system, and the rules are slightly different for each state, but most states \"bind\" their delegates to vote for a certain candidate.  For example, if candidate A wins the primary in state XYZ then all of the delegates from state XYZ are required by state law to vote for candidate A.\n\nIn order to become the nominee, you must receive over half of the delegate votes.  In the current Republican nomination process, there are 2,286 delegates, which means you must receive at least 1,144 delegate votes to become the nominee.\n\nIt can happen that no one gets 1,144 delegate votes.  For example, one candidate might get 1,000 delegate votes, another might get 900 delegate votes, and a third might get the remaining 386 delegate votes.  When this happens, you have brokered convention.  In a brokered convention, the delegates are released from their \"binding\" and they can vote for anyone they want.  They can even vote for someone who wasn't running for President.\n\nSo they take a second vote from the delegates.  If one candidate gets at least 1,144 votes, then that candidate becomes the nominee.  If still no one gets that many votes, then the process repeats and the delegates vote a third time.  It keeps going until one candidate gets 1,144 votes or more."},

{"title":"ELI5: File Compression, .ZIP, .RAR, etc.","answer":"I'm actually doing a course on data compression at the moment :D\n\nIn addition to dictionary-based compression (as AnteChronos describes below), there are actually lots of ways to compress data. \n\nOne of the most common is Huffman coding. \n\nOrdinarily, characters take eight bits each to transmit - just enough information to hold any one of the 256 different values a char can hold. (let's ignore unicode and such for now). \n\nHowever, some characters tend to be a lot more common than other characters, depending on the kind of file you're looking at. So Mr. Huffman back in 1952 came up with a harebrained scheme that actually works: use much shorter bit-patterns for the most common characters, and longer ones for the rare ones. It's a little fiddly, as you can't use just any old codes - but follow the algorithm and you can get significant savings. \n\nOr then there's run-length encoding, where if you have a bunch of the same character in a row, you specify the character once, followed by the number of repeats - so instead of storing \"YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!\", you store the equivalent of \"YES26!\", which can save a whole lot of space as well. \n\nThere's even a bit of arcane magic called the Burrows-Wheeler transform, which imposes a partial (and reversable!) sort on a file, greatly increasing the number of repeated characters, thus greatly improving the savings that run-length encoding can attain. \n"},

{"title":"ELI5: The difference between acne and herpes","question_detail":"I know they are different, but they can look similar. I was just wondering what causes both of them.","answer":"Acne vulgaris is a disease.  It's caused, usually, by an increase in testosterone, a hormone associated with male development and hair growth.  Despite it being associated with males, everybody has it.  Since most males get their first big dose of testosterone in their teens, teen males most commonly have acne.  This increase makes the skin increase it's oil output, and hair growth, hence the beards.  The problem is, this can clog pores, and then bacteria can grow inside the pore, growing infected, which causes swelling (inflammation), redness (called erythema), and eventually can lead to pus buildup, like whiteheads.\n\nHerpes is a virus, with different strains.  Herpes simplex virus 1, or HSV-1, is an infection virus that is contracted from skin to skin contact.  Any skin contact with someone infected can transmit, they do not need to be breaking out.  The most common area for HSV-1 to transmit is the mouth, via oral fluid transfer.  HSV-2 is a sexually transmitted disease, and causes sores primarily in the genitals and anal area.  \n\nNote: these manifest as sores, usually open and dark, and at times painful, with or without discharge.  Sores are irregular, and repeating in the same general area, whereas acne follows the grain of hair, and appears primarily on the face, shoulders, back, and chest.\n\nThere is also herpes zoster, also known as shingles.  Shingles causes a strip of the body to grow painful blisters, after an initial infection of varicella zoster virus, or chickenpox.  Of all versions of herpes, this can look most like acne.  These will be rash-like in appearance, appear on any part of the body, and most importantly, they hurt.  Acne should be sore, but you don't want to scratch and dig it.

{"title":"ELI5:  Where do thoughts come from, how are they formed?","answer":"That's an excellent question, and the short answer is that no one really understands that yet.  We kind of understand some small parts of the picture, but not the whole picture. Its kind of like knowing how metal is mined out of the ground, and seeing how a watch works, and then trying to figure out how to make a watch. \n  \nYour brain contains cells called neurons, and they branch out at the ends like roots on a tree. The ends of one neuron can then come close to touching the ends of many, many other neurons. Through the use of small electrical signals and specialized chemicals called neurotransmitters, one neuron can send signals many neighbors, and each of those can affect many of its neighbors, and so on.  Let's call one set of many neurons that talk to each other a \"path\". \n  \nBecause of some tricky ways that those neurotransmitters work on the neurons, it is possible for one of these paths to be easier to send signals on, or more difficult. Using the same path over and over might make it easier for signals to move on it later on, and might make nearby paths more difficult to send signals on.

","answer":"A strike is a last resort. It costs the workers money and it costs the employer money. Think in terms of the MLB. If the players want a higher salary (which it seems they always do) they ask the union to get them more money. The owners don't want to pay more so they say, \"No.\"\n\nPeople from both sides try to work out a deal. The thing is, the longer the owners hold out on paying more, the longer the players have to play for lower pay. So the players decide they ain't going to play anymore. The owners can't sell tickets to games when nobody takes the field, so they might be willing to work out a deal. \n\nYou really don't want to try to take a job from the Major League player because you know as soon as you do, the fans won't come to the games, and the owners will agree to the players demands or at least a compromise for both. \n\nIt works the same for every union. If the truck drivers strike, there is nothing moving on the highways and a lot of spoiled meat in rest stops. Anyone breaking the strike by crossing picket lines looks at a temporary job at best. "},

Never go to a website and supply personal details (or logon details) if someone has just told you to go to that website and given you a link.\n\nFor example, if you're sent a link to go to your bank site and update some personal information (or any other reason) and they supply a link to do so, delete that email.  If you want to verify if that was really necessary type in the url yourself, same with sites like amazon/paypal/ebay/ect.\n\nPeople seriously overestimate they're ability to notice a scam website, phishers (who \"phish\" for your personal details) are extremely good at making you believe you are at a real site, and at making you believe they are actually who they say they are."},
{"title":"ELI5: What is a VPN?","answer":"This is how I understand it. When you connect to a website, this is hows its connecting:\n\n     Home &lt;--&gt; ISP &lt;--&gt; Website\n\nThe data goes through your ISP. Now when you use a VPN, you tell your ISP to connect to the VPN. The VPN then connects to the website and sends you the data back encrypted. So now the diagram looks like:\n\n     Home &lt;--&gt; ISP &lt;--&gt; VPN &lt;--&gt; Website\n\nEssentially, without VPN, you say, hey ISP, connect me to thepiratebay.se, and the ISP knows that you visited thepiratebay. With the VPN you say hey ISP, connect me to the VPN. The VPN then connects to thepiratebay, and sends back the data encrypted which can only be unlocked with the key that only you and the vpn has. So all the ISP is seeing is that you are sending and recieving encypted data to and from the VPN.\n\nBandwidth costs money, and thats why VPN providers charge for the service.\n\n*Disclaimer: I'm not an expert on this and this is my understanding of info I read on the internet so I don't know how accurate this is."},

{"title":"ELI5/AskComputerScience: How do CAPTCHAs work and why can't computers solve them?","question_detail":"Aren't they generated by a computer? Why can't computers solve them?","answer":"CAPTCHAs are designed to necessitate tasks that computers are bad at, but humans are good at. This generally involved image processing, because it's something that human brains are amazingly good at.\n\nLets take a simple example; the user is asked to click on the picture of a cat, out of a cat and several dogs. Now, that's easy for you, but...well, how do you explain to a computer what's different about the cat? The answer is a combination of relatively subtle features that the brain is good at recognising, but none of them are obvious from just looking at the pixels of the image. A computer trying to solve the question would need some very sophisticated processing to achieve any degree of success.\n\nAnother common case, that of heavily distorted letters, is quite similar. We're very good at recognising letters from their essential features even under heavy distortion, but it's very hard to put down in words exactly how we do it.\n\nThat said, computers actually are good at many captcha kinds of tasks, which in part has driven the advance of more sophisticated captchas. For instance, one kind of poor captcha is a question like '5+3=' and the user has to insert the answer. If this is just expressed as text, it's very easy for a computer to strip out the text and calculate the answer, because it's already all in language the computer understands."},

{"title":"ELI5: What is an RRSP in Canada and why do I need it?","answer":"An RRSP is a savings plan that is designed to help you save for retirement.\n\nIt allows you defer taxes for income gained in the account, as well as give you a tax credit for money that you put into the account. Taxes on the money in that account are deferred until you withdraw them from the account, and that acts like income at that moment (there is also a with-holding tax, but more on that later).\n\nLet me explain with an example, and that will make more sense to you. I'm going to make up some numbers to make it easy to follow.\n\nAssume you are making $100000/year.  And assume that the Canadian government allows you to put in $20 000 that year into your RRSPs.  Any money you put into that account is not taxable.  And assume that the top $20 000 of your $100000 salary is taxed at a rate of 50%.  So since you put in $20 000 that year, you only need to claim $80000 on your taxes. \n\nIf you work at a job that automatically pays your taxes out (almost all jobs), then when you do your taxes at the end of the year, the government sends you a check for a tax credit since you used your RRSP.  In this example, the government would give you a $10k tax return since you were taxed for $100k but deferred $20k of it through your RRSP. \n\nSo for that year, because you put into your RRSP's, you didn't have to pay the taxes on the $20000 you made.  But since it's in your RRSP account, you can't actually use it to buy things.  What you can do with it is invest in something so that your money grows to help you retire.  You can invest in various things, like bonds, stocks, or GIC's.  Any money you make through your investments inside your RRSP will NOT be taxed.  \n\nHowever, if you decide you want to pull your money out of the RRSP, it will act as income.  So let's say you make $100k/year and you pull out $20k from your RRSP.  For that year, your income becomes $120k.  And since the $20k you pulled adds to your taxes at a rate of 50%, you have to pay the government $10k out of that $20k.  There are other penalties applied too, depending on your province.\n\nThe reason you want RRSP's is three-fold: 1)it reduces your current taxes for the year, 2) it allows you to make investments that don't have any taxes attached to the gains, and 3) it allows you to bank up money for retirement.\n\nWhen you're of retirement age, you can use a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) to withdraw from your RRSP to pay for your living expenses. Since you're retired and your income will be less, you will be paying less taxes on your withdrawn savings at that point in time."},
{"title":"ELI5: the three major political parties in the UK (Liberal Democrats, Labour and Conservative).","question_detail":"What do they stand for? \nTheir manifestos?\nAnd any other useful pieces of information are greatly appreciated.","answer":"The Conservative party is a right wing party. They think that they government shouldn't interfere with people's lives too much, that free-market capitalism (leaving companies alone to do their thing) is the best thing for the economy and that Britain should be strong and independent from Europe (it should still be a part of the European Union but the EU should have very little say in how the country should be run). Taxes should be low and social welfare and unemployment benefits should be kept to a minimum. Immigration should be restricted. Historically, it is the party of the socially conservative (people against sexual liberties, divorce and homosexuality) and the wealthy with strong support from the elderly, rural areas and the South East.\n\nThe Labour Party is a left wing party. They think that they government should make sure everyone in society is looked after. Traditionally it favoured trade unions and protectionist economic policies (taxes which gave British industries an advantage over imports) although in recent years it has moved to a more free-market capitalist stance. Britain should have a strong voice within Europe, taxes should be progressive (higher for the wealthier), immigration is a good thing and the social welfare system should be very strong. Historically it is the party of the working class, with support in poorer and urban areas, the northern part of England and from the Asian (Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi/Sri Lankan) and Black communities.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats are a centre party. Their major policies are of 'libertarianism' - everybody should be able to do whatever they want free from government control. They think the electoral and political systems should be reformed to make voting more representative of smaller parties, and that the House of Lords (sort of like Congress but not elected) should be abolished. The government should be reduced in size and citizen's privacy (in things like CCTV, police and government records, fingerprint databases etc) should be protected. Their political ideology is close to that of the Conservatives, but often their policies on important issues are closer to Labour's (for example, on the raising of university tuition fees). Because of the voting system in Britain the amount of the vote they get is bigger than the number of seats that they win (15-20% of the vote, 3-9% of the seats). Their vote is usually widely distributed (not particularly popular in one area or with one group) but they have a strong base in Scotland."},

I have yet to see any proof of his death or the manner and time of his death other than the word of Mr. President Obama. \n\nThe closest thing I ever seen too real proof was in Dec. 2001 when it is said that he died shortly after leaving the American Hospital in Dubai. Afterwards he had a will reading where he apologized to his wives and children for giving them a difficult life followed by a small funeral and he was officially declared dead due to kidney failure by his friends, family and followers, not to mention the local and international news papers.\n\nBut the US news said that was all just a lie to confuse us because he was still alive. And we believed that without proof as well. \nAnd now, 10 years later All we know is that Obama said he killed him and that was that. \n\nAnd of course we all know that Mr. Obama and/or the US government would NEVER EVER lie to us common peasants, but I have to ask the question: How gullible are we that we accept the every word of our government without a single shred of proof what-so-ever.\n\nObama: We got him!

{"title":"ELI5: How to write a symphony?","question_detail":"The basic structure and what have you, I've been reading up on Mozart and have found myself rather curious.","answer":"The basic structure of a symphony is that it has four movements.\n\nThe first movement is typically in sonata form, which is a pretty highly structured way of building a piece of music based on a few musical ideas. It's usually quite fast. I can try to explain Sonata Form like you're five if you really want...\n\nThe second movement is typically a slow movement. It doesn't have a particular structure, but is likely to be more reflective in mood.\n\nThe third movement is traditionally a dance - a minuet and trio. This is sort of a pre-cursor to a waltz, and is in three time, and quite fast. You have the \"minuet\" section, then the \"trio\" section which is a change in tune/mood (and isn't actually related to three in any way), and then a repeat of the \"minuet\" section again.\n\nThe fourth movement is fast again. It can be a rondo, which is a structure with a tune that you keep coming back to, then a bit more music, then the original tune again, and then more music etc.\n\nAs well as knowing the basic structure of a symphony you'd also need to be familiar with the instruments in the orchestra, what you can do with them (eg, strings you can have playing long sustained notes or you could have them pluck the strings for a different sound), and what sounds good with what (eg. if you get the brass to play loud and the strings to play quiet, the sound of the strings may not come through). \n\nFinally you would also need to know about harmony, as in what notes sound good together, and which ones don't.\n\nDifferent composers have done different things with symphonies, but generally it's a good idea to know what the Classical rules are first so that you can break them effectively. :)"},
{"title":"ELI5: Why is classical music titled by a musical note?","answer":"Like howboutme said, it designates the key that the piece is in.  A piece can be in a key starting with any of the 22 notes.  There are far more than 12 **names** for all of these notes (for example, C# is the same tone as D^b), so you can see any mixture of these.\nOn top of having the letter note designated, a key also designates the \"mode\" of the piece, which basically gives you its \"mood/feel\".  A piece will most popularly be in major or minor.  Major keys are written with capital letters, while minor keys are written in lowercase.  So if I want to write a piece in E-flat minor, it would look like e^b while F-sharp major is simply F#."},

{"title":"ELI5: the culture that surrounds the Grateful Dead.","answer":"The Grateful Dead are, despite scoffing by people who don't \"get it\", very good musicians, and early on they started dealing with themes that resonated with the counterculture movement (even though they started as a pretty generic blues band, if I remember right).  They happened to be in the right time and place to become associated with the hippie movement.  Unlike many of the other bands at the same place and time (e.g. Buffalo Springfield, Jefferson Airplane) they never changed all that much and they never stopped touring or enjoying their own music.  \n\nAs the hippie movement hit a high water mark in the 1970s and sloowly faded, they were constant enough to remain a focal point for a movement that at one time was at the forefront of the national consciousness.  \n\nThink of them as sort of like the Beatles in their own genre, without the amazing hype of Beatlemania or the flameout after the self-discovery.  They more or less hit a groove and kept grooving until their bodies (well, Jerry's) gave out.  Like the Beatles, they did stuff that was really amazing and creative, and also stuff that was banal.  Also like the Beatles, they did a lot of stuff (especially live) that was amazing and new but now seems hackneyed because everyone has borrowed it, and the zeitgeist has moved on --  but their best stuff remains powerful and fresh, even today.\n\nBecause they were a focal point for the hippie movement for so long, many people grew to associate their music (one of the trappings of the back-to-nature alternative-lifestyle movement) with the movement itself.  That is not surprising, because their live shows were sort of like miniature Rainbow Gatherings, often with more people *outside* the show hanging around than inside the show -- especially at outdoor arenas.\n\nTheir live shows were indeed amazing things -- they had a way of evoking many of the same feelings normally attributed to religious experiences (and I say this as someone who has been to a lot of Dead shows and never taken drugs at one).\n\nFor more on the connections between the GD and the origins of the 60s counterculture / hippie movement, you could do worse than to read Tom Wolfe's still-awesome \"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test\" (mostly about Ken Kesey and LSD, but the GD figure in it).  Like all Wolfe, it's extremely approachable and engaging, as well as thoroughly researched and vetted.  There are a *lot* of books that focus more on the grateful dead touring lifestyle, especially later in their career, but TEKAAT is readable and engaging and enlightening.  You should dig up a used copy and read it.\n"},

I don't know who wrote the first two, but they were all gibberish to me and I'm closer to austrian than neo-keynesian (mainstream economics).\n\nThe current mainstream sees the economy as an equation which needs artificial balancing. They contend that the market is so efficient that it is in constant equilibrium and certain divine interventions (i.e. price fixing, subsidiaries, inflation/deflation) are an improvement on as long as it is gradual and calculated. \n\nWhereas austrians believe the market is run by people, who's rationality cannot be described by equations or fooled by price-fixes for all of eternity. And that the only intervention should be to prevent fraud and other violent behavior.\n\nMany Austrians predicted the housing bubble, the nasdaq bubble, the 15-20% interest rates of the early 80's, the 15% annual inflation in the 70's. Whereas no mainstream economist to date AFAIK have predicted any of them short of the point at which they are actually in austerity. At which point they point the finger elsewhere (OPEC in the 70's, dotcom businesses in 2000, derivatives in 2008).

Therefore your friends and family would be dead while you still be almost as you are now.\n\nMy problem with this is that speed/velocity(?) is relative. You can only measure your velocity in relation to something else. You can say you're moving with the speed near the speed of light but then everything around moves as fast the other way. So why it's you who would experience this fast-forward in time and not the rest of the Universe - so that you'd be old or dead and the rest would experience only few seconds passing. \n\nLet's say there are two trains passing each other.

If you *did* have them meet up, you'd have to decelerate the trains somehow, and the results depend on how you did that. If you stopped one train, and then accelerated it until it got back to the other train, the train you accelerated would experience less time.\n\n"},

Why would Paquiao not consent to that? \n","answer":"The consensus is mainly that Bob Arum who promotes Paquiao doesn't want to the fight to happen.  He risks his cash cow losing and being worth less later on.  Normally Arum stages fights where he is the sole promoter usually both fighters are from his stable.  His fighters mainly fight inhouse.  Floyd used to be under Arum but left and has been promoting himself (also through golden boy promotions owned by Oscar De La Hoya) meaning he gets far more money.  So there is some bad blood from Arum as he seems to hold a grudge against Floyd.  Arum won't agree to be a co-promoter with floyd/golden boy for this fight.   Floyd won't agree to a fixed price and Arum getting all the pay per view money.  Arum has been ripping off fighters for half a century, and doesn't seem to like not being in control.  As for Paquiao not consenting to drug tests, it's a tough one.  By refusing it makes him look guilty of using performance enhancing drugs.  It could just at his ego won't let him agree, as there hadn't been any suggestion of being a drug user in his career until the mayweather camp brought it up.

I was ok up until the last 30 minutes with the blue box. Then the movie stopped making sense. ","answer":"A talented and attractive but deeply insecure young woman (Diane Selwyn) moves to Los Angeles hoping to become a big-time actress, where she falls deeply in love with a more confident, successful actress (Camilla Rhodes) who helps her kick-start her career and allows her to mix with some Hollywood bigwigs, earning her a few minor movie roles. She is eventually rejected by her fame-hungry lover who becomes romantically involved with a well-known director, flaunting her new relationship in front of Diane at a dinner party. Diane suddenly finds herself alone and scared in the cutthroat world of show business, and feels she is now doomed to failure. Despondent and in a jealous rage, she hires a hitman to kill Camilla, thinking this will make her feel better. However, when she receives confirmation that this has been completed (blue key), the reality of what she's done hits her and she sinks into a deep depression which eventually turns into a paranoid psychosis resulting in her suicide.\n\nAt the very beginning of the movie, before we know of this backstory, Diane falls asleep one last time, her tortured and delusional mind causing her to dream of a world where she is the polar opposite of what she has become. In her dream, she is still a fresh-faced, innocent young girl, confident and in control. She is the one the big director wants but can't have, only due to circumstances beyond their control (Mafia intervention in the film's casting process), she is the strong one in the relationship protecting her friend and lover and helping her navigate a dangerous world. Still though, people and places she saw while she was planning the real-life murder keep creeping back into her perfect fantasy world, causing the more nightmarish moments of her dream (For example, the scared man in the diner was a guy she saw paying for his meal while she was meeting with the hitman in real life. In her paranoid state, she seemed to at least subconsciously suspect that he knew what she was up to, this becoming another fear in the back of her mind manifesting itself in her dream). The blue box signifies Diane's consciousness, the blue key triggers her memory, forcing her to open the box (awaken). She awakens back to her horrible reality and reflects on the events that led her to the crushing emptiness and despair that she now has to live with. Here we see what happened to cause the twisted nightmare we just saw, and eventually her suicide.\n\nDavid Lynch is portraying the corrupting and dehumanizing nature that underlies the glitz and glamor of the Hollywood film industry. It's a big middle finger to those in the industry that perpetuate and thrive off what he sees as a soul-crushing environment.\n\nThis is just my \"abbreviated\" take on the story, sort of an overall picture, and there's plenty that it doesn't explain. I've tried to stick mainly to explanations that are typically not disputed in the hundreds of threads out there on this subject, since just about everything in this film seems to be open to some interpretation. Sorry if it's not 'ELI5' but Mulholland Dr. is not exactly one for the kids.\n\nEDIT: changed \"figure\" to \"finger\""},
{"title":"ELI5: How is a least squares regression line calculated?","question_detail":"Analogies very welcome!","answer":"I'm assuming you can find the formula elsewhere, so I'll describe the idea.   \n  \nThe least squares regression line is the line drawn between a set of points such that when a line segment is drawn at right angles from the regression line to each (x,y) point, and the length of those line segments are each squared and then are all added up together, that sum is the smallest possible number.   \n  \nWhy square the length of all of those line segments? It makes it easier to avoid having negative numbers when you do the math.   \n  \nWhy do all that? Because that line's equation is the best guess for the equation that describes the x,y relationship of those points. If it wasn't the best guess, then the line segment squares would add up to a larger number. If the equation of the least squares regression line is a perfect fit, then the sum of the squares of the line segments will be zero....every point will lie on the least squares line."},
{"title":"What is single side band?","question_detail":"I have had a strange interest in CB radios lately and I want to know how SSB works. Can people overhear a conversation on an SSB channel?","answer":"Single sideband is a type of *modulation*: one of a variety of techniques for putting information into a radio signal and decoding it at the receiver site.  The more common type of modulation in CB is called **amplitude modulation**, and abbreviated AM (as in AM radio, which works this way too).  SSB is a more advanced type of modulation that allows for twice as many channels, and makes more efficient use of transmitter energy (can reach father).\n\nIt does nothing to prevent people from overhearing a conversation.  They just tune in to the same channel as you, use the same sideband setting, and they can listen in or jump into the conversation."},
{"title":"What is Objectivism? ","question_detail":"what does it mean as a political ideology?\n\nedit:grammar","answer":"Objectivism is a bunch of ideas put together by a woman named Ayn Rand in the middle of the last century. She took some ideas from math, logic, philosophy, and economics and put them together into a big system of ideas. Objectivists say that Ayn Rand had the world's greatest ideas ever, but a lot of other people say that they are not.\n\nAyn Rand wrote novels based on her ideas. Her most famous novels are *The Fountainhead* and *Atlas Shrugged*. They are mostly about strong men who stand up for themselves and who don't let other people boss them around. They are also very long and kind of weird, for novels; *Atlas Shrugged* has one part where a character gives a lecture that goes on for dozens of pages. But people who like Ayn Rand say that they are the best novels anyone ever wrote. She also wrote some other books like *Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal* which are not novels; they are non-fiction books about her ideas.\n\nObjectivists call Ayn Rand a philosopher. But a lot of philosophers don't think she really was one. Philosophers like to argue with each other and hang out with people who disagree with them, because disagreeing is interesting and that lets them figure out what they really think. But Ayn Rand mostly liked to hang out with people who agreed with her, and sometimes she would stop hanging out with someone if they disagreed on philosophy or even on music.\n\nThere are some famous people who used to be friends with Ayn Rand when she was alive. One of these is Alan Greenspan who used to run the Federal Reserve, which is the big bank that is in charge of money in the United States. So a lot of people have heard about Ayn Rand because someone said that she was friends with Alan Greenspan.\n\nYou might have heard about people who are called \"libertarians\". Libertarians think that nobody should get to boss around other people unless they agree to be bossed around. Ayn Rand thought that too, but she didn't really like libertarians very much because they didn't always agree with her. (Libertarians care about some weird things that Ayn Rand thought were dumb. And they didn't always agree with her about the *philosophy* of not-being-bossed-around even when they agreed on the *general idea.*) But some libertarians like Ayn Rand's books anyway even if she didn't like them very much. People who don't like Ayn Rand *or* libertarians sometimes tease them about that."},
{"title":"ELI5: The difference between .jpg and .png files and other similar files.","answer":"The most important thing to understand, and which the majority of computer users, even some people who make a living working with computer images, don't understand, is that *JPEG is designed specifically for photographs*. And this means that if the image is not a photograph - for example, a screenshot of this page, or an animated cartoon image, or a pie graph - using JPEG will get you bad results. The edges will be poorly defined and solid blocks of color will be blotchy. JPEG lets you adjust the compression level, so you can make the files really small, but then they will really look like crap.\n\nPNG is not optimized for photos. So for images which are not primarily photographs, this is the recommended format. Edges will be sharp, and solid colors will be solid. Also, PNG can have transparency, which JPG images cannot.\n\nGIF is an older format, similar in use to PNG, but which has the limitation of 256 colors.

{"title":"ELI5 Why Amsterdam stopped selling weed to foreigners","answer":"It is popular to think of Europe, and in particular states like Spain or the Netherlands, as being liberal countries compared to the United States. One often forgets that there are conservatives there as well. \n\nMarijuana was decriminalized in the Netherlands in 1976, under a left-wing coalition government (Den Uyl's). The current government of the Netherlands (Rutte's) is a center-right coalition. \n\nConservatives in the Netherlands have three major concerns about Amsterdam.\n\nFirst - the Netherlands has become associated with drug use. They do not like this. \n\nSecond - there is a major issue of foreigners who enter the country to use drugs, and in the process, overuse and end up hurting themselves in a myriad of ways. This costs the Dutch government money, because these foreigners do not pay for the services they may use. In the current European environment of austerity, saving money, any money, is a goal - though some may say that the money they bring in (air fare, hotels, food, taxis, etc) outweighs the expense. This is a political issue. \n\nThird, and perhaps most importantly - it is a major international issue due to drug trafficking. Many drug dealers in France, Germany, or other BeNeLux countries obtain their product from the Netherlands. Drug enforcement is a contentious issue between these two countries, and harms relations. \n\nAs a result of these three reasons, the Dutch government, while not willing to criminalize it outright, has limited the sale to foreigners.

{"title":"Civil unions, marriages, and rights. Please ELIF","question_detail":"Could someone please ELIF the differences, rights, what it all means? I'm pro LGBT, but woefully undereducated on the differences between all of the terms. ","answer":"Sometimes a grownup loves another grownup very much, and they want to tell everyone that they are promising to be together forever, so they get married, which is like telling the government that you two will be together forever. When you tell the government this, they give you special rights that people who aren't married don't get, like being able to stay with them if they have go to the hospital, or being able to keep their stuff if they die.\n\nSome people are very protective of the word \"marriage\" because they think that only a man and a woman should be able to have one. They feel like their own marriage is not as good if men are allowed to marry other men, or women are allowed to marry other women. But sometimes men love other men very much, and sometimes women love other women very much, so, \"civil unions\" were created. A civil union is a marriage and gives almost all of the same rights as a marriage, but they don't call it a marriage to keep the people who are protective of the word \"marriage\" happy. \n\nBut, some other people do not think that a civil union is as good as a marriage. If you saw an animal with a beak and wings, you would think that it's a bird, right? If it flies like a bird and has a beak like a bird, why is it not a bird? So these people want to let any two people who love each other and promise to be together forever be married. \n\nThere are already lots and lots of laws and rights that people who are married get to have. If we create a \"civil union\", we have to remember every time a law about married people or marriage is changed, that we also have to change the law for civil unions too. This makes twice as much work for the government and the people in civil unions might get forgotten about.\n"},

Many major hospitals have already began using EMR technologies, and its use should continue to grow rapidly from here on out. In fact, the government is pushing for the technology to allow patients to have online access to their own records 24/7. EMR is facing a lot of resistance because people are concerned about the financial, security, and privacy risks involved. A lot of that criticism is valid, but to me, it seems like people are afraid of change. Kind of like each time Facebook changes its UI.

Also, it doesn't look like she's wearing high heels. There are 2 ways to do that. Easiest one is finding a picture of shoes being worn and photoshop these feet into the picture. \n\nI've found something like that [pic](http://imgur.com/a/6x0eM#m7K6N)\n\n * Open picture of your sister and picture of a shoe. Select the whole leg (ctrl+a) and copy it (ctrl+c) then paste it to your sister (ctrl+v). You've added another layer to your composition. It's a bit large, so adjust size (ctrl+t) so it fits into the canvas (don't make it too small, because we need to erase the background). \n\n * Use magic wand tool (W) and click on a background - it will select similar colours. Play with tolerance a bit (32 should be good, but you may go higher) and press delete. \n\n * You might want to create another layer (ctrl+shift+n), fill it with green and put it behind your shoe to provide better contrast.\n\n * Use Eraser tool (E) to get rid of the rest of the picture. Use [] to adjust size of the brush and {} to adjust hardness. Toggle capslock to change from point view to shape view of the tip of your brush. Remember, if you make a mistake click ctrl+z go back one step and ctrl+alt+z to go further back.\n\n\nIt should look like this: [pic](http://imgur.com/a/6x0eM#yIb5f) (notice I've made it fade a bit with soft brush. It'll help later)\n\n* Now we need to put it on you sister. Delete green layer, select shoe layer and use transform tool (ctrl+t) to make it fit.\n\nIt should look like that: [pic](http://imgur.com/a/6x0eM#gxDXx)\n\n* A bit of old foot is sticking out. Click background layer and use Clone Stamp Tool to cover it. While holding alt click area you want to take your sample from and start retouching. \n\nIt should look like this [PIC](http://imgur.com/a/6x0eM#lbIDO)\n\n* Now this is the tricky part. Use burn/dodge tool (both under O) to get glare/shadow effect, go to image/adjustments/curves and play with it to get right balance. I needed to also go into .../adjustments/vibrance and get it a bit down, along with saturation to get the colour right... you need to experiment to get matching skin. \n\nYou could do it much better with a little practice, but end result looks like this: [pic](http://imgur.com/a/6x0eM#Jy6Zv)\n\n-----\n\nBONUS!\n\nYou can select areas with Lasso Tool (L) and then change their hue in image/adjustment/hue/saturation (ctrl+U). That way you can make different colours of the same shoe. Also ctrl++ and ctrl+- and clicking while holding \"space\" may come in handy.\n\n----\n\nEDIT Spelling and typos"},

{"title":"ELI5: The difference between credit cards and debit cards","question_detail":"How does each of them work?  And how do you go about getting good credit?  I've heard from my friends that it's good to use your credit card once in a while, but I've also read that it's better to use cash because of hidden fees and things like that.","answer":"When you use a credit card, each purchase you make is a small loan from the bank.  Your credit limit is the maximum amount the bank is willing to lend you for all of these small loans combined.  At the end of your billing cycle (which might be the end of the month) they add up all of your purchases and give you 2 totals.  One is the minimum payment amount (which is usually like $25 or 1% of your total purchases) and the other is your new balance amount (which is the actual total purchases).  If you pay the new balance amount before the due date, they won't charge you any interest.  If you pay the minimum amount, they'll charge you interest on the amount you didn't pay.  If you don't pay anything or if you pay less than the minimum, they'll get really mad at you and charge you a lot more money.\n\nDebit cards are different.  Debit cards take money directly out of your checking account for each purchase, so you are never getting a loan.\n\nA credit card can build good credit, a debit card doesn't do anything for your credit.  There are a few factors that make up a good credit score.  The major ones are how long you've had credit, paying your bill on time, how much credit you have available to you (your credit limit), and how much credit you use each month compared to how much you have available.  So, it's good to always pay on time (and always pay in full to avoid paying interest).  It's also good to only use 30-50% of your credit limit; if you consistently use more than that, then it looks like you're in financial trouble, and you should probably ask for a limit increase or get an additional card.  It's also good to get a credit card early and hold on to it for a long time."},

I am not condoning the use of torrents for copying material illegally. \n\nOk, a torrent file must be opened by a torrent client program. There are many different ones, just like there are many different programs to browse the web. The most common client is \"Microtorrent\", but it is written as \"utorrent\" (the Greek letter for u is the scientific symbol for \"micro\"). You can get that program for free, very easily. Once you install it, you can use it to open torrent files. Opening a torrent file connects you to other people who have the stuff you want so you can start to download it. In the torrent client, there will be a readout on how much of the file is downloaded, how fast it is coming, and also how fast YOU are sharing with others (by default, you will be uploading info to other people). \n\nThere is no real way to guarantee that a file is safe. Trust me, there are many, many bad files out there that can mess up your computer. However, many torrent sites will have a comments section where people will leave notes about whether the file had viruses.

{"title":"ELI5: How do oil speculators contribute to the rising gas prices?","answer":"Hope this gets a better response, but I did take one economics class in college. From what I remember:\n\n\nBasically, these speculators want to buy low and sell high. They drive up the price of oil when it is low by buying it. They also sell the oil when they think the price is high enough. \n\nThese speculators do not ever really need to store the oil themlselves, they can just kind of bet on what the price will be in the future, and have buy oil from somebody today to sell it in a couple years or so. If I estimate the middle eastern oil will dry up in 5 years, I will buy a bunch of oil now lets say $100 a barrel. In 5 years it happens to be at $250 a barrel. I then sell my stockpiles at the higher price. This raises the price.\n\nThe good thing about speculating is, if the price were to go above a certain number, certain speculators would start mobilizing their reserves (prevnting an energy crisis or even higher prices). You kind of have to play a game of storing your stockpile and making money, but also selling it when the price is at it's highest and before other speculators sell their stockpiles and drop the price again.  \n\nThis process causes stockpiled oil to be sold at a higher price, but also causes oil prices to be more stable. \n\nAgain, there will likely be a much better explanation from someone who knows more about economics!"},

Apparently, objects exposed to hard vacuum get stuck together. Is it real? There seems to be some dispute. Why does it happen? How long does it take? Are there any practical applications for construction in space?\n\nP.S. No *Rama* spoilers please, I'm only on Chapter 12:\n\nEDIT: The relevant passage from *Rendezvous With Rama*, chapter 5, emphasis mine:\n\n*Norton had travelled only a few metres when he came across an interruption in the smooth, apparently metallic wall. At first, he thought it was some peculiar decoration, for it seemed to serve no useful function. Six radial grooves, or slots, were deeply recessed in the metal, and lying in them were six crossed bars like the spokes of a rimless wheel, with a small hub at the centre. But there was no way in which the wheel could be turned, as it was embedded in the wall.*\n\n*Then he noticed, with growing excitement, that there were deeper recesses at the ends of the spokes, nicely shaped to accept a clutching hand (claw? tentacle?). If one stood so, bracing against the wall, and pulled on the spoke soâ¦*\n\n*Smooth as silk, the wheel slid out of the wall. To his utter astonishmentâfor he had been virtually certain that any moving parts would have become* **vacuum-welded** *ages agoâNorton found himself holding a spoked wheel. He might have been the captain of some old windjammer standing at the helm of his ship.*","answer":"First, awesome book. \n\nSecond, \"vacuum weld\" is something of a blanket term that covers a few different happenings.\n\nTo begin with, there is a process called \"cold welding.\"  This is something I first learned from mountain biking.  The seatpost on your bike, if it isn't coated in a thin layer of grease, can cold weld to the tubing of the frame on your bike.  It's cold welding because typical welding involves huge amounts of heat to join two metal pieces.  Instead, what if we took the same amount of heat, and instead of a single direct application that lasts less than a second (as in \"hot welding\"), we distribute that heat in the form of pressure, over the course of a year let's say.  Remember, pressure and heat are closely related. \n\nThe pressure comes from the bicycle frame, if there's a big gap between tube and seat-post your seat wouldn't stay in the same place.  There's also pressure from you sitting on it, and riding over lots of rocks, and going off jumps.  You could almost think of it like the difference between microwaving a bowl of soup for a minute, or throwing ingredients in a slow-cooker for 12 hours.  The end result is similar, but the process takes much longer.  \n\nNow, on to Rama.  The process referred to in the book is actually cold welding, I'm pretty sure.  I'm trying not to reveal any spoilers, but I believe it was a part of the ship itself that had \"vacuum welded\"?  Not a separate object?  If so, then it was cold welded.\n\nIt's almost impossible for two separate objects to vacuum weld, like say two satellites crashing into each other.  First, because it's in a vacuum, their inertia would likely cause them to separate.  If we pretend some parts somehow became entangled, and the two satellites stayed coupled, cold welding is still very unlikely to happen because there simply wouldn't be enough pressure.  Gravity can cold weld two items, given a long enough amount of time.  In space there simply isn't the weight of one item imposing on the other, since they're effectively weightless.  If both satellites had engines that ran infinitely, pushing both satellites directly against each other, cold welding might take place.\n\nAnd finally, there is a technique called vacuum welding developed by NASA awhile back.  Now, have you ever seen a [vacuum chamber?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_chamber)  They're freaking HUGE, because if you create a vacuum, nature tries really really *really* hard to fill that vacuum, so the chamber needs tons of reinforcement.  Well NASA figured out how to use this to their advantage.  Put two metal plates really close together, and create a powerful vacuum between the two edges you want to join, and blamo!  The force of filling that vacuum causes the required heat/pressure necessary to join the two pieces.  "},
{"title":"ELI: Why buying in bulk is cheaper?","question_detail":"I guess an example is: if a factory will be producing a good \"infinitely\" anyways, why is buying in bulk amounts cheaper? ","answer":"Would you rather have a guaranteed 1 million dollars, or a 50-50 shot at 2 million dollars?\n\nThat's the same basic principle. When you buy in bulk, the company is comfortable making less profit because you're guaranteeing the sale of lots of items. When you buy one at a time, they need to make more profit per unit because they have no guarantee as to how much you'll buy. They're trading some profit for some security, just like you did when you presumably chose a guaranteed $1m over a gamble on $2m.\n\nThere are other factors, too, like the cost of distribution, and the fact that you'll likely just buy more when buying in bulk (if they didn't sell 24-packs of Coke at the store, would you buy 24 individual cans when you went shopping? Probably not), but that's the main point."},

{"title":"ELI5: Boltzmann Brain","answer":"From what I understand, it goes like this: \n\nEverything in the universe is a game of chance. Take a deck of cards, for example. Shuffle it a few times and ask yourself: What's the probability that the shuffled deck will end up neat and ordered by suit and number? Very very low, but there is a chance.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, let's say that when the deck is scrambled and messy, it has high entropy, and when it's neat and ordered, it has low entropy. \n\nThe universe is like the deck in that it's constantly shuffling around but with atoms instead of cards. You've probably heard of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which says that the universe tends to increase in entropy over time. Well, instead of a law, it's more like a really really strong suggestion. It's overwhelmingly probable that the universe will shuffle itself into a mess (just like a deck of cards), but, given an infinite amount of time, the universe will eventually shuffle out a neat configuration.\n\nA Boltzmann brain is a local pocket of neatness conspired out of the random fluctuations of atoms. It's like having a 10-J-Q-K-A of spades together in a 52 card deck. This brain is self-aware, has (false) memories, and disintegrates rapidly after it forms. This ties in closely with the [Omphalos hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omphalos_hypothesis), a very interesting read. \n\nContrast this with a \"regular\" but stable evolved brain that came from an ordered planet (like having a totally ordered deck), which is many orders of magnitude more unlikely than just having a small brain rise out of disorder. \n\nThe crux of the idea is this: if these tiny Boltzmann brains are much likelier to pop into existence than a regular brain, aren't you and I much likelier to be one of these Boltzmann brains?

{"title":"ELI5 - Single electron transistors.","question_detail":"What purpose do they serve? How are they made? How do they work? ","answer":"Transistors are used primarily to do two different things (there are some others, but these are the main ones). One thing they can do is to amplify signals.  I don't think SETs are ideal for that. They have some very desirable characteristics, but you'd also need a lot of them to do \"high gain\" amplification of a very small signal into a very large one. Other types of transistors are more useful for most amplification circuits.\n  \nBut the other thing transistors are used for is as an on/off switch, such as inside of a microprocessor chip. For that, you want a transistor with various desirable characteristics. Some of those characteristics are that the \"off\" state conducts as little current as possible, and that the \"on\" state conducts as much current as possible, and that the transition between on and off can happen as quickly as possible.  If the off state is very good (the transistor doesn't \"leak\"), then the other transistors don't need to have as much on current and the transitions can happen faster, because control signal current doesn't get wasted by leakage.  \n  \nSingle electron transistors are very good at not leaking when they have low voltages on their gate terminal. (Normal Field Effect Transistors always leak just a little bit.)  They are usually (but not always) made by forming a region of the transistor with a \"quantum dot\", a very small island of silicon or other appropriate material. FET transistors don't have this feature. A quantum dot is small enough that at very low temperatures, it can only have one excited transistor on it at a time. So once one is there, no new ones can move on, and the current is completely blocked. If voltage is applied to the quantum dot, it lets elecrons move on and off, still one at a time, but the current is now flowing."},

I thought Sarkozy was pretty popular actually. So I guess what I'm asking is, what happened in France in the last few years and what place is there for Hollande's economic views in France and in the EU crisis. Thanks!","answer":"First of all, the Socialist Party in France is not an extremist party. It is the equivalent of Labour in Britian or the Democrats in the US. They are centre left and not far left or extremists in France. The French Socialist party ruled France from 81-95, in the middle of the Cold War. They are not exremists, but centre left even though that is more left than the US. You can say they are socialist by name only\n\nSarkozy lost popularity because people dont like his style, more than not liking his policies. Also France is in an economic crisis so its not surprising that he would lose popularity\n\nThe FN is more extreme. They have been gaining ground because of the economic crisis aswell added to the increase of globalization. They are very against immigration but also put importance on economic issues- they want more protectionism so French jobs stay in France and dont get outsourced to Asia, they want to get out of the Euro, more subsidization to rural areas.\n\nHollande is against austerity. So he is against the EU plans that will impose austerity. He wont do anything radical. France and Germany need to work with each other to get things done. Hollande is not an extremist, in fact, he is one of the most right wing in the Socialist party. In france however, rich people will feel more taxes."},

With springs, potential energy is proportional to compression, so with a REALLY big spring, you could increase elastic potential to a very large figure.  Then, just don't let go.  The more elastic potential a spring has, the more kinetic energy converted when you let go, so the more likely it is to do some damage.\n\nBut then that depends on what you mean by \"too much\".

This will not be used for stargazing. ","answer":"Some telescopes use mirrors, others use lenses.  Lens telescopes, also known as refracting telescopes, are generally cheaper but the lens may blur the things your see, an effect called aberration.  Mirror telescopes, or reflecting telescopes (newtonian, cassegrain etc.) produce sharper images but at increased cost.  The larger the lens or the mirror, the more light it can gather, making more distant objects appear more visible.  The f-ratio number is a measurement of the magnification power of the lens or mirror.  It's the ratio of the focal length to the diameter.  The higher the f-ratio, the smaller the field of view.\n\nIf you're just using it to check out a view (or for some nefarious purpose) a refracting telescope will work just fine.

I took one Macroeconomics course and somewhat understand CDOs and CDSs, if that helps you explain Market Derivatives to me like Im 5.","answer":"There is no such thing as a 'market derivative'. What you are talking about is the Derivatives market - the market that derivatives are traded on.\n\nA derivative is a contract between parties for goods that is derived from the value of something else. For example. You own a lemonade stand and you want to buy lemons from farmer Joe when his lemons will be ready to harvest in 30 days. Now, Farmer Joe needs to prepare for his next planting, however he needs money to buy seeds. Meanwhile, you don't want someone else to buy Farmer Joe's lemons when they are ready, so you and Farmer Joe comes to an agreement - a contract to buy Farmer Joe's lemons in 30 days. This is called a future.\n\nHowever, there is a problem. The price of lemons are known to be volatile, and Farmer Joe wants to sell the future lemons to you at a fixed price so he can starts his preparation for next season. Let's assume that the contract is for you to buy 1,000 kgs of lemons at $1/kg. The value of this future is $1000 (value = what Farmer Joe gets paid).  Meanwhile, the value of potatoes is also $1/kg, however, the potatoes market is known to be stable - the price of potatoes doesn't change as much as lemons does. \n\nTherefore, you and Farmer Joe comes to a new agreement. In 30 days, you will buy 1000kg of Farmer Joe's lemons. However, the payment for Farmer Joe (the value) will be calculated not by the market value of lemons, but by the market value of potatoes (the value of the lemons future is derived from the value of potatoes, hence derivative). \n\nNow, 30 days has past. The price of lemons has dropped 20% to 80 cents per kilogram, while the price of potatoes has stayed still. As per contract, Farmer Joe receives $1000 for 1,000 kg of lemons, where as he would have only received $800 for 1,000kg of lemons. As you can see, this allows for speculation. By speculating that the price of lemons will drop, Farmer Joe was able to earn $200.\n\nNow, in the financial world, derivatives are used for this 'lock in' effect. Banks for example, speculate on the interest level for their loans. Assets (lemons), can be used to speculate on the value of bonds, currency etc (potatoes). For example. If a Bank speculates that the interest rates will soon rise, they can use derivatives to lock in the interest rate to something stable (e.g., the U.S Treasury bonds). This allows you to, if you speculated correctly, to continue borrow money at 3% interest when the interest rate is up to 10%. Conversely, if you think the interest rate is going to fall, you can sell futures that derives their value from something stable, and thus allow you to lend money at 10% interest rate while the interest rate is at 3%. \n\nThe problem of course, arises when the value of the good that the derivative is derived from changes unexpectedly. This is for example, how the Global Financial Crisis started. Many derivatives were created based on bonds that were rated AAA - that these bonds were very stable, and thus their value can be counted on to remain relatively the same. However, these bonds turned out to be trash. Lets go back to our previous example. After 30 days, the price of lemons dropped from $1 to 80 cents, however the price of potatoes dropped unexpectedly from $1 to 40 cents because they weren't as valuable as everyone thought they were. Now, Farmer Joe will be only paid $400 for 1,000 kgs of lemons, and this isn't enough for him to plant the next crop, and thus he is bankrupt."},

An excerpt:\n\n&gt; **Brown Liquors**\n\n&gt; * Whiskey (Everywhere but Scotland): Distilled from malt, rye, or corn. Rye whiskeys tend to have more \"complex\" flavors. Whiskey from Canada is a crime against humanity. The default liquor. Recommended drink: Manhattan.\n\n&gt; * Bourbon: A whiskey made primarily from corn. Specific to a certain area (Bourbon County, KY). Tends to be sweeter and more complex than your average whiskey. Recommended drink: Old Fashioned.\n\n&gt; * Scotch Whisky (AKA \"Scotch\"): A whiskey made only from malted barley. Technically all Scotch is made in Scotland, but copycats in Japan have also proved delicious. \"Single malt\" means the brew comes from a single batch. \"Blended\" means various batches have been combined. Recommended drink: Scotch, neat. Anything else would involve crap scotch, or you ruining good scotch.\n\n&gt; * Brandy: Made from grapes. Essentially it's what happens when you distill wine. Cognac and Armagnac are brandies from specific regions in France. Tends to be more \"fruity\" than \"caramel-y\" when compared to whiskeys. Sadly unappreciated by White America. The VSOP stands for \"Very Special Old Pale,\" a high level on the brandy grading rating system.

{"title":"ELI5: Zipf's Law","question_detail":"Can't get my head around this law to do with natural language processing. Tried reading and re-reading Wikipeida's explanation several times and still understand it no better. Can anybody help me out? ","answer":"Basically, Zipf noticed something really interesting in the frequencies of words.\n\nHere's the basic observation. If we look at a given text--let's say *Moby Dick*, we find that the the most frequent word is *the*, and it occurs 13,721 times. The second-most frequent word is *of*, and it occurs 6,536 times. The third-most frequent word is *and*, and it occurs 6,024 times. If we keep going all the way down to the *hapax legomenon* (words which only appear once in the text), we find that these more or less form a straight line ([see this chart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Moby_Dick_Words.gif)).\n\nThis straight line shows the inversely proportional relation of the frequency of the word to the rank of the word. This means that the higher a word's rank is, the higher it's frequency is.\n\nSo we would expect a word that is ranked ~~25th~~ 8th to be less frequent than a word that is ranked 1st. In *Moby Dick*, this is indeed the case. The 1st-most frequent word is *the*, with 13,721 occurrences. And the ~~25th-~~ 8th-most frequent word is *him* (off of my rough estimate), with 1,058 occurrences.\n\nZipf found that this doesn't just hold true for *Moby Dick*, it holds true for any sizeable text (or corpus) we would want to look at (the Bible, the script of *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*, etc.). And it isn't just in English, either. As far as we've found, it holds true across all languages.\n\nHowever, it isn't perfect. Very small texts usually don't work very well, but we'd be talking about *really* small text. In my own personal corpus of Ainu, I have about 8,531 tokens (1,779 unique words), yet Zipf's law appears to hold true.\n\nAnother issue is in the lower tail--that is, the very infrequent words--Zipf's law also doesn't hold.

Who loses the money?","answer":"Stocks are a reflection for how much money a company makes.  So what you are basically asking is, how do companies create wealth seemingly from nothing?\n\nAll wealth is created in the same way.  Wealth = resources + productivity.  If you find a stick on the ground, and whittle it into a flute, you have created wealth.  You have created something of value that didn't exist before.  You combine a resource and your time to add value that didn't exist before.\n\nIf people really like your flutes, you might start a company, and people might invest in your company's stocks, which would tend to go up over time.  But all of that is based on combining resources with productivity to create wealth. "},

How does the selling of something intangible help the environment?","answer":"Not an area of expertise, but when I have any idea and there are no answers I like to try and at least help. So I shall try.\n\nCarbon credits are part of the [cap and trade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_and_trade) scheme. To understand them, you'll need to know the (very) basics of cap and trade. It is the cap and trade system that, theoretically, helps the environment. The *cap* is a limit: Only X units of a given pollutant may be emitted. So firms either receive a default allotment of permitted emissions or buy them. The permission to emit comes in the form of *carbon credits*â\"A carbon credit is a generic term for any tradable certificate or permit representing the right to emit . . . [pollutants].\"  The transfer of carbon credits represents the *trade* in cap and trade. \n\n\"Carbon credits create a market for reducing greenhouse emissions by giving a monetary value to the cost of polluting the air. Emissions become an internal cost of doing business and are visible on the balance sheet alongside raw materials and other liabilities or assets.\"  Essentially, as a market forms around carbon credits, saving and selling them is incentivized."},

{"title":"ELI5: Game theory","question_detail":"I've always been interested in it, but have never understood how it works, even very basically. I recently read a novel by Desmond Bagley (*The Spoilers*) in which one of the characters is presented with this situation:\n\nThey are in a ship full of valuable cargo being pursued by another ship. The other ship can not yet see them. They can either turn in towards the coast, or go out to sea. If they go out to sea, they have a 30% chance of survival if they encounter the other ship. If they go towards the coast, they have an 80% chance of survival if the other ship catches up with them. If the other ship turns in the direction other than the one they went, they have a 100% chance of survival.\n\nThe character in the book solved it by making five sheets of paper, one marked. They put them in a hat, and picked.  If they got the marked one, they would go out to sea. When the other characters asked him why, he responded with something along the lines of \"I'll tell you later\" and \"game theory\".

I would love for someone to explain a bit of it, and why this particular situation was resolved that way.","answer":"It seems way better to go toward the *coast*, right?

You know that it is better to go toward the coast than toward the sea, but you have to choose unpredictably to avoid getting caught. \n\n**So you pick randomly but with a higher chance of going toward the coast.**\n\nIf you do a bunch of math you will find out that you should go toward the coast 78% of the time, so the captain's plan with 5 sheets of paper is a good plan."},

{"title":"How do black holes work?","question_detail":"Mainly - Where does what ever it sucks up go? ","answer":"Think of a sheet that you have stretched out and tied between four bedposts. Not too tight, a little loose, Just enough to give. This is space/time. Space/time is also one of those super expensive sheets made of reinforced carbonfiber Kevlar that cannot possibly break. (they totally exist) \n\n Now take a golf ball and place it into the middle of the sheet. We'll call this \"Saturn\". Saturn has mass, so it makes a dimple in the fabric of space/time around it. Let's call this gravity. Anything that get's really close to Saturn gets pulled in towards it, but not too bad, you can easily just push it out of the dimple. \n\nNow take a bowling ball and throw it into the middle of the sheet. We'll call this \"Star\". Star is much bigger and heavier than \"Saturn\" It sinks WAY down into the sheet, making a much bigger dimple in the fabric of space/time. Objects approaching \"Star\" start to be pulled in much further away and with much greater force. \n\nNow take a marble, called \"Singule Airity\" marble, only this marble actually weighs as much as a car, throw it onto the sheet. Now this tiny, tiny, GIGANTICLY heavy object stretches and stretches the sheet, it sinks down into the fabric SO deep, that the sheet literally wraps around the top of the singularity. Now at this point, it's important to understand that space/time is not flat, like a sheet, but our entire universe is like a giant bowl of jello....like fruit salad...with golf balls and bowling balls and marbles all in it, each making a dimple in a jello of space time around it. You don't sail on the Space/time sheet like a boat, you're tunneling through the jello.  Now going back to Singularity. Its SO heavy, that it creates a little pocket of space-time around it, where there is no way \"out\". This is called the \"event horizon\" of a black hole. Once you tunnel into that pocket, once you cross that threshold, it doesn't matter how fast you go or how hard you push, you just going around in tiny little circles inside that pocket, and every direction leads into the middle. \n\nAs to where you go. You and the black hole become VERY intimate....like 80lbs of crap in a thimble, intimate.

{"title":"ELI5: How people are injured by bombs?","question_detail":"I don't quite get how bombs are actually deadly. I understand that people can get thrown up in the air or against walls and be injured but what moves them? Shock waves? How? Is it the actual metal parts of the bomb exploding like shrapnel that can harms? Does dropping a bomb from an aircraft make it more powerful?","answer":"Firstly bombs have fuel which burns, so you get lots of heat. (You actually land up with two of these blast waves from most explosions, but I won't go into that)\n\nBomb fuels are specially chosen to let off a ridiculously large amount of gas in a very small amount of time, which is in a very compact area. The gas needs to get out, and it does so very quickly. Too quickly in fact, because all the other gas that was made by the bomb is pushing it away. The gas is pushed so hard that it is forced to move faster than it normally can, and this forms a blast wave (which is similar to a shock wave, but with minor technical differences that I won't get into here). You can think of a blast wave as an instant change in wind speed. One second the air is still, and then the next second you have a wind blowing at several hundred miles an hour. Remember that this wind is very hot, because it comes directly out of burning fuel. \n\nCarried by the wind, you have the metal bits from the bomb (shrapnel), but also dust and sand and bits of everything else that was between you and the bomb. That works like sand paper, and basically just rips your skin. Don't forget that this skin is probably already quite badly burned from the really hot wind.\n\nThen you get your body's own reaction. The blast wave isn't stopped by your body. Your body is soft and squishy and the the wave has no problem passing through your organs. Your organs don't like that, and it's not unusual for one of them to tear or burst. Your bones are solid though, and the blast wave and put up quite a bit of resistance to the shock wave. The shock wave pushes back, and often one or two bones can't take that pushing and snap. Your body is pushed backwards really quickly, and often your brain hits the inside of your skull, which can cause major damage.\n\nOccasionally, the wind can lift you and throw you around, but that's not normally the main cause of damage.\n"},
{"title":"What does does the polarity refer to in a molecule?","question_detail":"missed a lesson, now im having trouble grasping this concept on my own. Help please!","answer":"Basically a molecule consists of protons, neutrons, and electrons.  Protons have a positive charge, neutrons have no charge, and electrons have a negative charge.  The electrons have some freedom in where they go.  At any given moment, the electrons can be more on one side of the molecule than the other.  This can be due either to random chance, or because there is an especially electronegative (meaning it attracts electrons) nucleus at one end.\nAs a result, the protons and neutrons at the end with fewer electrons will not be fully balanced out and that end will develop a slightly positive charge.  On the other hand, the end with all the electrons will develop a slightly negative charge.\n\nThe polarity effectively is the measure of the extent to which this occurs.  In cases where the molecule is well-balanced based on its electronegativity, there may be a small polarity because by random chance, more than 50% of the electrons end up on one side (because they fly around like crazy in not so predictable ways).  Then this causes a slight imbalance in charge and the molecule next door can perceive this change and its electrons will be slightly attracted to the positive side of the first molecule.  The electrons of the neighbor on the other side are repelled by the negative charge.  As a result, these molecules are weakly attracted to each other and can remain in liquid or solid form at low temperatures.  One good example would be butane or propane.  It doesn't take much to break these forces.\n\nOn the other hand, if you have one end of the molecule with a very electronegative nucleus, it attracts the electrons more than random chance.  The same thing happens with the next-door neighbors, but there's the additional pull caused by the molecule's inherent structure and lack of electronegativity balance.  It takes much more energy to break these bonds and make a gas (think of water).  These are dipole bonds.  A hydrogen bond is a strong dipole bond where hydrogen is bonded to a very electronegative element and the polarity can be rather strong (water has 2 of them and DNA is held together by hydrogen bonds in the middle).\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5 atomic bombs","question_detail":"what makes them go off? what is inside of them?","answer":"First of all, basically we can fuse small elements to release energy and create bigger elements, and we can split really big (and unstable) elements into smaller elements, also releasing energy. We need both of these processes for an atomic bomb.\n    \nA basic atomic bomb has 3 levels.\n\nExplosive outer core. When this detonates it squeezes the inner core, think of squeezing a small rubber ball in your hand. \n\nThe inner core has two pieces, all the way inside is a small \"hydrogen pellet\" and that is surrounded by a uranium shell.\n\nWhen the ball is squeezed, the pressure is so high the pellet fusses and that releases a bunch of neutrons. The neutrons are like little bullets and fire outwards from the very inside of the inner core to the outer uranium shell.\n\nThis is when all the magic happens. If you can get enough uranium into a small enough space, called a *critical mass*, and if you can get some neutrons flying around... the neutrons will hit the uranium atoms and split them. This will release even more neutrons which will hit more near-by atoms.\n\nAs long as you have a critical mass and you have some neutrons flying around you can start the *chain reaction*. The squeezing of the rubber ball by the explosive outer layer serves two purposes, it creates the critical mass by squeezing the uranium, but it also, and this is very important, squeezes the hydrogen pelllet and fusses it, that fusion releases some neutrons and starts the chain reaction in the critical mass.\n\nThe original explosion of the outer layer does not create enough energy to split atoms, that takes neutrons fired like bullets, so the tiny \"hydrogen pellet\" is used as a fusion trigger to start the chain reaction of splitting atoms.\n\nThat is a basic atomic bomb.\n\nA hydrogen bomb, uses this process to create a bunch of energy but instead of merely a small \"hydrogen pellet\" a much larger source is used. When the outward atomic blast from the spitting atoms happens that also causes an opposite reaction of intense squeezing and the larger source of hydrogen is fused and with clever geometry and amazing blast many many many times stronger than an atomic bomb can be created.

I feel like the horses would rip right through that car as though it weren't even there. Is it really based on horses?","answer":"Horsepower, in an automotive context, is basically just twisting force that has been divided by RPM.\n\nSo, if you twist strongly but not very fast... low HP.\n\nOr if you twist fast but not very strongly... low HP.\n\nTwist fast **and** hard *at the same time*... high HP.\n\nTechnically HP is a measure of energy, or work. But when it comes to cars, the above description is a lot more real-world accurate.\n\n\nIn your thousand horses example, the horses win because they have more friction. All their hooves digging into the ground easily overpower the car's very small contact patches where the tires touch the road. To make the test more \"fair\", you should hook both the car and the thousand horses up to a big weight,  and see how fast they can drag it up a steep hill. It takes energy to drag things uphill. How fast you can drag a heavy object up a big hill is a decent measure of how much energy you can throw down."},

Maybe some guy in Texas just found a big new oilfield and now there is more oil on the market than there was the day before. Then the price would go down.\n\nCurrency is not that different. If people are buying stuff from another country (in this example Mexico), they will need to convert whatever currency they have (be it US Dollars, Euros etc) into Pesos, which is the currency that Mexicans use. If a lot of people are doing this, the value of the Peso will rise. If relatively fewer people are doing it, the value will fall.\n\nBut governments can also affect the value of currencies.

That no other nation in the history of the world had been born out of similar circumstances, and no other ever will. \n\nConsider:\n\n* There is nowhere on the planet remaining that could be colonized like the Americas were.\n\n* The United States was created during the Age of Enlightenment, and was positioned to take advantage of social advancements, without having much of the cultural baggage of Europe. And its founders were from the countries at heart of that movement, in contrast to, for example, the Spanish Americas.\n\n* The nineteenth century saw the devolpment of transportation technology that allowed mass immigration from overseas and expansion across the continent.\n\nBecause it is special in this way, according to exceptionalism, it has a mission or responsibility to lead the world in progress. \n\nIt's like if you were in school/college and there was this one kid who was lucky enough to be smart, popular, friendly, from an affluent family, and a nice guy. Everyone would be saying \"Hey, YOU ought to be student body president.\" And it's difficult for him to refuse, even if he doesn't want to be prez. He's so exceptional, it's his mission, his destiny.\n\nAdded to this, or as a consequence of it, there is an aspect of exceptionalism that says it's not just historical circumstance, it's a divine calling  - that \"we're on a mission from GOD.\" \n\nPersonally, I think the divine calling part is dangerous nonsense, but the main foundations of American exceptionalism - the unique historical circumstances - are valid."},

{"title":"ELI5: Latency or \"Ping\"","question_detail":"What is latency? In many games it is referred to a little coloured dot and a number. If the latency is low, it is green, medium - is yellow, and really high - it's red. But what does it mean? And some people actually knew where I was from just from looking at the latency I have. Please, someone explain like I'm 5.","answer":"A **ping**, in Internet terminology, is a special message, also called an ECHO_REQUEST, that one computer can send to another. When a computer gets this message, it automatically sends back a different message called ECHO_RESPONSE. The point of these messages is to let us test the network; they don't (usually) carry much else in the way of information.\n\nYou can send these messages using the `ping` program from your command prompt. You tell it what machine (IP address or hostname) you want to send the requests to, and it will tell you how long it takes for the responses to come back. Since the requests have to go out from your machine to the other one over the network, and the responses have to come back, there is a *round trip* involved: all the way from your computer to theirs and back.\n\nGamers often use the word \"ping\" to mean *round trip time* for other messages besides actual pings â for instance, messages from your computer to a game server that actually carry information. Network and systems people would call this **RTT** (for \"round trip time\", of course) instead, and it can be different from the ping time.\n\n**Latency** (or \"lag\", or \"delay\") is a less precise idea. It just means \"how long it takes a message to get from here to there\" and engineers often use it to mean the *one-way* time as opposed to the round-trip time. (It depends, though. Sometimes we say \"latency\" to mean RTT, too. But it's important to know which you mean.) The latency from A to B can be different from the latency from B to A, but the round-trip time includes both.\n\nThe word \"latency\" comes from a word meaning \"hidden\" and it means the amount of time that a message isn't at the sender or at the receiver, but somewhere \"hidden\" in the network in between them. You can think of the network between two machines as a big pipe â if you pump stuff through the pipe, it takes time to travel from one end to the other. When the stuff is in the middle of the pipe, neither the sender or the receiver can see it â it is *latent* or hidden.\n\nBut how fast messages travel (the latency, in seconds) is separate from how big the pipe is (the bandwidth, in bits per second). If you multiply the two, you get the amount of traffic (in bits) that is \"in transit\" at any moment.\n\nAnother problem on some networks is **jitter** or changes in latency. If a link is usually very fast (say, 15 milliseconds from here to there) then you might expect it to *stay* that fast all the time, but it probably won't. There will be times when it gets a little slower due to congestion or other problems. Jitter causes trouble for streaming media, voice chat, and real-time games.\n\nBut none of these are the easy way to tell where someone is. The easy way to do that is **geotargeting** which means looking up their IP address in a big list of ISPs and locations."},

{"title":"ELI5: How video game emulators are created.","question_detail":"It seems kinda crazy how old video games systems are ported identically onto computers. Since I'm sure there are quite a number of technical details, hopefully someone can explain to me how they're made.","answer":"A video game console is basically just a computer, and every computer has a processor. Each processor can be described by its **instruction set**. The instruction set is the complete list of things a processor can do. A simple example of an instruction set would be something like this.\n\n    LD regA, addr           ; Load number\n    ST regA, addr           ; Store number\n    ADD regA, regB, regR    ; Add two numbers\n\nThe ADD instruction does exactly what it sounds like. It adds two numbers together. In this case, it takes the number from register A, adds it to register B and stores the result in register R. A **register** is just a place for the processor to keep a number. However, most processors only have 8, 16 or 32 registers, and most programs use a lot more data than that. That's why there are the LD (load) and ST (store) instructions. This lets the processor move data to and from the computer's **memory**. The details of how this works aren't important, but memory is a place where millions or billions of numbers can be stored. Every location in memory has an **address**, so the load instruction fetches a piece of data from memory at a given address and saves it in a register. Store takes a piece of data from a register and puts it back into memory at a certain address.\n\nSo, all a program is, is a list of these instructions, which move numbers around and use them to do math. The problem is, different processors essentially speak different languages. Every processor is going to have load, store and add instructions, but one processor won't be able to understand the load instruction of another processor. Kind of like how lots of languages have a word for cheese, but unless you speak those languages, you wouldn't know that \"KÃ¤se\" is the German word for cheese, or \"fromage\" is the French word for cheese.\n\nIf I want to write an emulator for the original Nintendo (NES), I need to find out what type of processor it uses. Once I know that, I need to look up the instruction set for that processor. Now, I need to write a computer program that can understand the instruction set of the NES's processor. That is just how you build one part of the emulator, but the other parts are going to be somewhat similar. In order to render the picture, I need to know how the processor sent information to the television. It might be something like, the processor wrote data about the picture to addresses 100 through 199, in a particular format. That means that I then have to write another part of the emulator to turn that data into a picture.\n\nPut simply, it's a lot of careful reading about how the old gaming system worked, and writing programs that handle data the same way the original hardware worked."},
{"title":"ELI5 - I'm surprised this hasn't been asked; The current state of Congo, and how it go the way it is.","question_detail":"*got the way it is","answer":"There is a book called \"King Leopold's Ghost\" that is a great history of the Congo, very easy read. Here's what I remember from Geography of Developing Nations class:\n\nDuring the European colonization of Africa in the 1800's, European countries like France and Germany explored and staked claim to large areas of Africa, even though there were relatively advanced civilizations living there. Europeans began to harvest these resources and use them to turn a high profit or sustain wars at home. \n\nBelgium was kind of late to the party. They got a foothold in Congo and started looking for resources they could use/sell. The main one was rubber. Rubber vines were a source for latex to be used in textiles and machinery. Artificial latex would not be discovered until WWII. The European colonists forced the native people to collect (often) unreasonable amounts of rubber sap from the forests or face mutilation (hands, feet chopped off, people killed, entire villages burned). \n\nThis went in for many years, even after most European countries pulled out of Africa. Finally, Belgium allowed Congo to become its own nation, but at that point things were pretty much wrecked. I don't know much about the more recent history of civil war and such, but most of the instability is due to abuse at the hands of colonists and their subsequent pull out, leaving a country with no leadership and a horrible, horrible past to deal with."},

{"title":"ELI5 why do submarines need to be pressurized.","question_detail":"Aren't the outer shells hard enough to protect the crew?","answer":"Most submarines are pressurised at basically normal atmospheric pressure, like military submarines, so the crew can work and breath just like on the surface, even if they are far underwater. These subs have really strong hulls that are able to keep the enormous water pressure out, even with normal atmosphere inside. These subs are usually really big, heavy, and expensive - and even though they can dive pretty deep, they mostly can't go to the really deep places in the ocean.\n\nOne way to make a submarine able to dive deeper, and require a less bulky and expensive hull, is to make the air pressure inside the sub much higher than normal. This means it a little bit easier for the hull to keep the water pressure out, since there is a little less difference in pressure. It is of course, much harder for humans to live and breath normally in this high pressure air. Different concentrations of oxygen in the air have to be used, and often the air is mixed with weird mixes of different gasses just so the people can breath in the high pressure air. But if you want to dive really deep, and not have a crazy massive hull, sometimes its necessary to have high pressure inside your vehicle, so you can keep the water pressure outside from crushing your submarine."},
{"title":"ELI5: How do sunglasses work and are fake ones dangerous or bad for you?","answer":"Polarized sunglasses are worlds better than sunglasses with just darkened glass.  Polarized sunglasses block light which is polarized in the opposite direction as the sunglasses are polarized.  An explanation of polarization is beyond the scope of this post.  \n\nEssentially, what this means is that reflections off of horizontal surfaces, such as a lake, or a car, will be at least partially blocked by the sunglasses.  Since these are what tend to blind you while driving or boating, this is very important.  \n\nSunglasses with just darkened glass reduce all polarizations of light equally.  However, due to the way your eyes and brain respond, they end up doing basically nothing after you've adjusted to the new, lower level of light.  "},
{"title":"ELI5: How do two different colors combine to make a completely different color? How does our mind process this (instead of just seeing a mix of blue and yellow we see green)?","answer":"Our mind processes the mix of light, not the mix of paint.  Light and paint mix differently.\n\nThe more light you add, the brighter it becomes.  This is called additive color space.  The primary colors for that are [Red, Green and Blue](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/AdditiveColor.svg).  Our eyes have special sensors that can identify these three colors.  When several of the sensors are activated, our brain mixes them as different color, like red and green will make yellow.\n\nThis is how a TV works: it's a dark screen with tiny red, green and blue lights that send colors directly to our eyes.\n\nIn paint it's different.  You start with white, which reflects all light rays towards your eye, and the more paint you add, the darker it becomes.  This is called subtractive color space.  The primary colors here are [Cyan, Magenta and Yellow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SubtractiveColor.svg), which happen to be the complementary colors of Red, Green and Blue, which will make sense below.  Some art teachers will use blue, red and yellow as primary paint colors, but that's only an approximation.\n\nIn paint, a color works by absorbing some of the light.  Cyan absorbs mostly red lights and reflects green and blue, which our brain will interpret as cyan.  Magenta absorbs green, so it leaves red and blue which make magenta.  Yellow absorbs blue, which leaves red and green that mix in our mind to make yellow.\n\nSo when you mix a bright blue (mostly cyan) and yellow, you have a color (cyan) that absorbs red, and a color (yellow) that absorbs blue.  So the only light that is reflected, *way before it even reaches our eyes*, is green.  That's why we see the mixture of cyan and yellow as green.  Our brain did nothing for the mix, it's purely the absorbing properties of the paint.\n\n**tl;dr:** When you mix colored lights, our brain makes the mix.  When you mix colored paint, the absorbing properties of the paint make the mix."},
{"title":"Why Games Install DirectX For Every New Game?","question_detail":"http://i.imgur.com/6exk1.png\n\nIs it not all the same DirectX? Are these redundant copies? What does DirectX even do that can't be reused?","answer":"DirectX is a set of tools released by Microsoft that help programmers use your computer efficiently without having to know exactly how it is set up. The game programmer can just ask Direct3D (the graphics portion) to draw a yellow cube, instead of having to have 15 different yellow cube drawing bits depending on your computer. The programmer also benefits because he knows that the DirectX bits (usually) won't be the cause of any errors; it was likely him telling D3D to draw a red cube, instead of D3D changing he color.The way that DirectX does this is through *dynamically linked libraries,* or DLLs. A DLL is a blob of pre-assembled code that other programs can use without having to have their own individual copy. When you install DirectX, you are actually installing a bunch of DLLs, so programs don't have to have their own individual copies of DirectX inside the .exe.\n\n\nThere is a problem though. There are dozens of versions of DirectX, and a game is compiled (changed into machine code, an .exe) assuming that the version the *programmers* had is the one *you* have. If you have DirectX 9.0.c, but the game needs 9.0.a, then the program will crash. DirectX attempts to solve this by allowing multiple overlapping installations, letting you have 9.0.c and 9.0.a *at the same time*. unfortunately for people installing things everywhere, the only way a game company is allowed to install the version of DirectX they need is to use the installer that is bugging you so much. \n\nThis *does* have some benefits though. By using the installer, the game is *guaranteed* to have the DLLs it needs, since the installer will check and fix your copy of DirectX if it happens to be broken."},

{"title":"ELI5: If light travels forever, why isn't it always daylight?","answer":"I'm going to assume that your question is related to why the night sky is dark.\n\nThis is actually a really good question and the answer to it explains one of the fundamental breakthroughs of 20th century physics. Scientists used to believe in a static universe. That is, one that doesn't change and has always existed. They also thought that it was uniform in every direction. So, no matter where you looked in the night sky, your vision should eventually intersect with a star.\n\nIn 1929 Edwin Hubble realized that almost all of the galaxies that he could see were moving away from us. He also realized that the further they were from us, the faster away they were moving. If you graph these two things out (distance and speed) you find that it's a very smooth curve.\n\nThe logical conclusion is that if you pick a galaxy far enough away from us, it would be moving away faster than the speed of light. But wait, you say, nothing can move faster than the speed of light. That's only partially true. Objects cannot move through space faster than the speed of light. But, it turns out space itself is expanding and that expansion can indeed happen faster than the speed of light.\n\nImagine that you have a balloon and you glue a few pieces of confetti to it. The balloon represents space and the confetti the galaxies. If you inflate the balloon, the pieces of confetti move away from each other without themselves moving.\n\nGoing back to your original question. There is a limit to how far we can see. Anything beyond that limit is moving away from us so fast that the light will never reach us. This limit is known as the galactic horizon. So, there are a limited number of stars that we can see and that's why the night sky is dark."},

Lightning is something similar. Clouds are like a big fluffy rugs that are constantly rubbing against other fluffy rugs. When enough charge is accumulated, they zap the Earth.\n\n----\n\nIn a bit more detail: when you get enough power, you can zap through anything and create size of a spark you wish. To make that kind of power, you need to have difference between positively charged particles (ones that had electrons snatched from them) and negatively charged particles (those with too many electrons). \n\nWater and ice particles in clouds are constantly bumping into each other. These collisions tend to steal electrons from ice and give them to water. Because ice is less dense, it tends to stay higher in a cloud. Now we have a cloud with a lot positively charged ice particles on the top and a lot negatively charged particles at the bottom. These changes tend to accumulate to the point where discharge is inevitable. "},

When one of these bugs can be exploited to reveal information or give an unauthorized user access, we call them just that - en exploit.\n\nA 0-day exploit is one that the software vendor is not yet aware exists. This means that no fix is under works because the developers don't even know there is a problem.

You can buy one of those from your local dealership, although the one that won the championship had a lot more stickers and some well-paid engineers tinkering with the engine.\n\n24 hour Le Mans is also enclosed wheel, they're all cars that you can go out and buy yourself. This is supposed to add to the excitement because you're working with a standard product and doing the best you can with it. 24 hour Le Mans, by the way, is who can go the furthest in 24 hours. It's held in Le Mans, France. Petit Le Mans uses the same idea but runs for 10 hours around a track in Georgia.\n\nThese are endurance races (who can go the furthest in a set time). Most races are who can complete a distance in the shortest time. Either around the track at the same time, or by completing a route one after another.\n\nOpen wheel cars look like [this](http://www.hdwallpapersarena.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/formula-1-cars.jpg). You won't have seen anything like this parked on your street, as they're purpose built. The excitement here is that they're much faster and the science and techy geeks love the fact that they've been built from scratch. They're thoroughbred racing machines.\n\nFor both types of racing, each country generally has its own national leagues (or championships, as they're called in auto racing). These are usually ranked lower than the international championships, where the best in the world all compete on one track. Often a young driver will prove himself at national level and then graduate to international.\n\n'Formula' denotes the type of racing, and generally, the lower the number, the faster, more powerful and more prestigious the championship. So Formula 2 is a slower version of Formula One. Formula One is often seen as the pinnacle of all motorsport, and that's where the drivers are paid tens of millions of dollars per year and become international celebrities.\n\nAs with many sports, American racing such as Nascar is not very popular outside of the States and what is popular with the rest of the world (Formula One, touring cars, the World Rally Championship) rarely makes an impression within the States.\n\nAuto racing is a huge and wide-ranging topic. I'm not sure if I've covered everything you were hoping to learn, but those are the basics. If you want to know anything more specific, let me know."},
{"title":"ELI5: How torrents work.","answer":"Like your 5 (and by that I mean I'm giong to draw a metaphor):\n\nThere are three kinds of downloading.  Downloading from server that allows multiple connections, Peer to Peer, and BitTorrent.\n\nLet's start with Peer to Peer and use the copying and transfer of puzzle pieces as our example.  You and your friend Katie both have have \"Super Transfer Tube 4000\"s.  Each STT4 has 10 connection ports that allow you to connect to other STT4s.  8 of those tubes are inputs, and you can get 8 different things at a time.  That's pretty cool because that's a lot of things.  The other 2 tubes are outputs, so you can send stuff to other people.  Also, these tubes only can handle one thing per second if they're being used (much much slower than the internet but, stick with me).  Following so far?\n\nAlright, lets move on.  Katie has a puzzle she made that she wants to send to you.  It's a 100 piece puzzle.  Katie connects her two output tubes to two of your input tubes so you can transfer all 100 pieces in 50 seconds (2 pieces per second).\n\nNow to Server Downloads:  Katie's puzzle has become really popular.  Reginald, who just got a STT 7000 (which has 10 input tubes and 10 output tubes!) gets a copy.  Now, if one person is connecting to Reginald, they can connect all 8 of their input tubes to his output tubes and get the puzzle in about 12 seconds.  But if two people want to download from Reginald, they can only connect 5 tubes each and get the puzzle in 20 seconds.  Still better than the original 50 seconds though.  So everyone can get it faster than the original peer to peer download.\n\nHOLD EVERYTHING:  Now there's this new \"Super Transfer Switcher Box\" that's just come out and can connect you to any STT that's been registerd.  The STSB takes as many of your input tubes as you want it to take, and it takes as many output tubes as it you want it to take (probably say 7 inputs, and 1 output so that you still have one of each free to play with your other friends).  So now you go register your STT4 with the STSB and tell it that you want to have a copy of Lindsey's puzzle.  The STSB looks at all of the other STTs connected and finds 7 connected outputs from others STTs and it connects their outputs to your inputs.  Now you can get Lindsey's puzzle in 15 seconds.  At the same time somebody else is getting Lindsey's puzzle from you.  The beneifit here is that, you can almost always be sure that you'll have 7 connections because there are a lot of people on the STSB and if each one gives at least one output tube, you're almost guaranteed to have the most number of tubes connected.\n\n----\nExplanation\n\nBitTorrent revolves around the fact that as a subscriber to an internet service provider, you almost always have a ton more download bandwidth than you have upload bandwidth.  In peer to peer downloads, you can only download as fast as your peer can upload, so it's not very fast.  In server downloads, you can count on a server to have paid more to their ISP for better upload speeds since that's what they primarily do but, they're still throttled because you can only connect to what they have to spare for each user trying to get data from them.\n\nIn bit torrent applcations though, you connect to multiple people so you can get the file in small parts from person A, person B, and person C at the same time.  Since  you can do it at the same time, the bottleneck of person A having a really bad upload connection isn't nearly as limiting because you can always connect to person D and get a small bit from them to.  This lets the bottle neck be how fast your download speed is instead of how fast someone elses upload speed is.\n\n----\nAnywho, I hope you found my metaphor to be somewhat amusing and I hope it helped explain thigns a little bit.  I also hope that you, or someone else, can take away something from the more technical explanation."},
{"title":"ELI5 how America became a superpower","answer":"The US had **largely been undeveloped**, so it had ample untapped natural resources that older ares did not have. \n\nIt is **geographically isolated**, leaving the possibility of invasion at near zero since we got on good terms with the British colonies that made up Canada. Europe by contrast was in a near perpetual state of war until the fall of the iron curtain.\n\nIt was **early to industrialize**, it was one of the first countries to do so beyond Britain.\n\nAfter World War I, **the US Dollar** became the default international currency for commodities trading which gave American businesses an advantage by getting cheaper goods.\n\nThe **New York Stock Exchange** is by far the biggest stock market in the world, bigger than the next biggest by triple. This further solidifies the US (particularly New York) as the financial center of the world.\n\n**During World War II we suffered no damage** and was largely the source of goods for the rest of the allied forces. After the war we were about the only industrial power that still had intact factories. It gave us decades of advantage over the rest of the world as they had to spend time and money rebuilding.\n\nFrom the mid 19th century until the 1980s we invested massively in our **infrastructure**, giving the US some of the best infrastructure in the world which helped boost productivity. \n\nThe US also has some of the best **post-secondary education** on earth, which attracts some of the world's best and brightest which helps the economy by leading to innovation before the rest of the world and giving the US an early and often permanent advantage. Think of Hollywood, Silicone Valley etc.\n\nNot to mention no other industrialize power has the shear number of people the US has. This gives American businesses **the largest possible domestic market** so that when they go abroad they have a greater base to draw from like Wal-mart or McDonalds.\n\n**Militarily** we have lead the western powers since World War II, and outspend the next 17 largest armies combined (of which 13 are our allies). Our navy is on tonnage along larger then every other navy combined including 33 of the 44 active aircraft carriers in the world. \n\nOur lead in **space** is basically without equal since the mid 1960s. \n\nDiplomatically, **the UN** is headquartered in New York. While there are UN agencies elsewhere the center is still New York.\n\nAnd finally, it should not be overlooked that the US is simply **powerful because of its size**. We are the fourth largest nation by both population and by size. This means that even when we were not the best per-capita, we were still the best by raw volume. Norway may have more money per person, but with just barely five million people that is less than New York alone. The US is by itself 20% of the world's economy and is the center for whole industries. \n\n**TL;DR** the US is much larger than any other nation, had more natural resources than almost any other nation and it hasn't been damaged by any wars in the last 150 years. It's size makes it a natural \"leader\" and that leadership position helps the US to become even stronger by being a center of trade and technology."},

I barely understand the other stuff in my 11th grade math class but at least I'm able to do it with enough time. So I'd like to learn how to graph but my math book apparently expects me to already know how too (Which I probably should) and just skips straight to graphing inequalities (Without explaining how to graph in the first place. Which is why I could use any help). So can anyone give me a hand with the simplest explanation possible? And then also what am I supposed to actually graph on? Am I suppose to do it in my head, or on paper, or is there some place online I can use to draw the actual lines for the graphing part? Thanks!","answer":"Start by understanding what a function is. A function is a process you apply to one number to get another number. If you change the starting number, you get a different answer. Some functions are very simple, others can be very complex.\n\nOften, you call the input number of a function âxâ, and the output number of a function âyâ. So we could start with the most basic function: x=y. So when x is 1, y is 1. And when x is 2, y is 2. Or we could have the function 2x=y. So when x is 2, y is 4. These are very simple functions. Another famous kind of function is quadratic functions, which can be written as ax^2 + bx + c = y, and it depends on the problem what values should be used for a, b and c.\n\nA graph can be used to work with functions very easily, because you have two axes â one for the input, and one for the output. For each value on the x axis, there is a corresponding y value, which is the output of the function. So for instance, for the function x=y, the graph looks like a straight diagonal line, because whatever value you choose as x is mirror as the value for y. However, a function like x^2 = y looks like a curved line, because the y value gets steadily bigger (the y values go 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49 etc). This is really useful, because now if you're given a value for x, you can just use a ruler to follow along from that x value until you reach the line of the graph, and then use a rule again to read across to find the value for y.\n\nYou can plot graphs on paper, using some calculators (if you have a smart phone, there are some great graphing calculator apps around), or on some web-based calculators like Wolfram Alpha. Practice plotting some simple functions on paper so you get the hang of it (try plotting 3x+1=y as your first one), but when you get on to more complex functions, no one will mind if you use a calculator, so long as you're able to understand and explain it."},

You shouldn't be embarrassed to ask your friend to tell you about them.\n\nAnyway, very briefly, Thomism is a school of philosophy based on the extensive thought of Thomas Aquinas, the 13th century Catholic philosopher and theologian. He is the major figure in medieval philosophy, and one of the first great thinkers of the western world's re-awakening from the dark ages. \n\nFranciscans are followers of the life and teachings of Francis of Assisi, a Catholic saint who founded a religious order (an organization of monks) around the beginning of the 13th century. St. Francis was especially known for his humility, poverty, and his love for everyone and everything - he is said to have preached sermons to flocks of birds and other wild animals. \n\nActually, famous short biographies of both Thomas Aquinas and Francis of Assisi were written by G.K.

{"title":"ELI5: Rudamentary Social Behavior","question_detail":"I was recently reading a thread on askreddit, and one comment stood out to me. A poster stated that while someone tells a story, he will ask questions he knows the answer to in order to keep the story flowing smoothly. This was criticized as being rudamentary social behavior, but I realize that these are skills I lack. I would like to become a better storyteller and conversationalist, can anyone help explain social behaviors that you think others should know?","answer":"Honestly, when you spell out actual instructions for conversation, it just sounds weird, and trying to follow instructions will feel weird. More than anything, just make sure you do these things:\n\n1. Give the other person affirmation that you are interested in what they are saying.\n2. Make then break eye contact regularly. It can be creepy to stare into someone's eyes through the a whole conversation, but not looking at them at all is rude.\n3. Ask questions that will keep the other person talking (doesn't matter if you already know the answer).\n4. Smile and laugh at appropriate times, but don't overdo it. Just a quiet chuckle will do."},
{"title":"ELI5: What is a political machine, and why are they significant","answer":"A Political Machine (in the US at least) was talking about an older system of **\"bosses\" who control almost every elected official in a city**. These bosses weren't always elected, but they made decisions in regards to policy rewarding those who were loyal and helping defeat those who opposed them. They had the loyalty of elected officials, businesses and usually quite a bit of money backing them up. It almost always **involved some kind of corruption**, either bribes to keep people loyal or demanding \"tributes\" from those below you. There was also often cases of voter fraud involved to keep elections going the way the boss wanted.\n\nThere are still a few, but **bosses are much more rare now** than they used to be and much less powerful. They only ever existed in the US as city or state machines, there has never been a national \"boss.\" It is much more difficult for them to exist now because anti-corruption laws are stronger and evidence gathering is easier (wire taps etc). But a lot of the corruption that still exists, particularly at city levels, is a kind of continuation from that early system.\n\nA good example was a guy named **Pendergast**. He was the **boss of Kansas City**. He was not elected to anything but he was in charge of the local Democratic Party so **he chose who ran in elections, he helped rig elections so that they would win, and in return he expected them to do as he said**. He used his power to have the city give his construction company many no-bid contracts to build roads and government buildings at very inflated prices. He personally profited to the tune of tens of millions of dollars (and this is 1930's dollars) which he used as bribes to keep elections rigged and politicians loyal. He even used his power to hand pick the Governor of Missouri and Senator of Missouri Harry Truman. Eventually he was taken down on Tax evasion and soon after everything else fell apart. That was the Pendergast Machine.\n\nLots of cities in the US had similar people who rigged elections and \"ruled\" the city, but they don't exist to that level of power any more. They were political machines."},

{"title":"ELI5 chair conformations","question_detail":"I have an organic chemistry test tomorrow and I don't understand how to write chair-chair interconversion. Could someone explain it to me?\n\nThanks!","answer":"The easiest way for to ring flip is to number the positions on the first chair (1-6). If the left side of the chair is pointing down in your first chair, after you flip it, the left side should be pointing down. Also, all axial positions become equatorial, and all equatorial positions become axial. The most stable conformation will be the one with the most equatorial positions. However, when you do a ring flip, up/down does not change. For example, a Br on position 1 of chair one that is axial pointing down will be Br on position one of chair two and equatorial, but still pointing down.

","answer":"As an outside observer it seems as though the main catalyst was the revelation that [a quite small proportion of US citizens are in control of the vast majority of the country's wealth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_of_wealth#In_the_United_States).  \n\nThere are plenty of other factors that tie into this like the way the US economy and banking system works and the universal trend of the rich to get richer and the poor to get poorer.  Not only that but the US real estate industry is tied up with the banks and it seems as though a number of people have been foolish, greedy or irresponsible with the money involved.  I'm sure I don't have to tell you about the size of the US national debt.  The US populace in general also bears some responsibility for the situation on account of the proliferation of credit card use and other such debt schemes.  \n\nSo to make a long story short, the US has money troubles the likes of which have never been seen.  This doesn't bother the rich people of course because they're at the top and they'll stay at the top.  So the weight of this trouble falls, naturally, on the poor people.  The everyday, minimum wage worker who has to stretch every dollar as far as it can go.  A lack of surplus income means that you have no way to better yourself, no way to improve your self or the quality of your life.  Bearing the brunt of someone else's irresponsible mistakes turns you into a cog in the big business machine.  Of course, how much blame belongs to whom is up for debate.  \n\nThe Occupy movement is a response to the perceived injustice of the situation.  It's an effort towards redress and reform.  It's a rebellion of elements of the system against representatives of the system like bees gathering together to sting the hive.  \n\nI feel like this explanation has been fragmented and confused but I'm not surprised because it's a fragmented and confusing situation.  There are a lot of variables to track and a lot of arguments to consider and I don't think anyone will ever know the full story.  You could think of it as the proletariat versus big brother, the little guy versus the man, the people versus the corporations.  You could just as easily think of it as the inevitable meltdown of a financial system that was always doomed to failure.  You could see it as the turning point where the US realised it wasn't in the 50s any more and that it really needed to pull its socks up.  \n\nI've been writing for way too long now so I'm going to leave it there and hope I've given you some kind of idea of how the Occupy situation looks from someone who is outside and far away who doesn't have a stake in the outcome.

{"title":"ELI5:Magnetos in a Cessena 172","answer":"Aircraft use magnetos, which are driven off the engine instead of a battery, making them more reliable at the cost of some performance.  Remember, a car with a busted ignition will fail and coast to the side of the road, a plane with a failed ignition will turn into a glider and crash.  Think of magnetos as a crank generator hooked up to a transformer stepping up voltage to neon sign levels.  This high voltage is used to create a spark.  As long as you have a turning engine, you'll have a spark to keep things going.\n\nYour Cessna has a dual spark system, which improves efficiency and redundancy, two separate magnetos power a two sets of sparkplugs, independent of each other.  Switching the ignition key to isolate each magneto as part of your pre-flight checks will show you that both ignitions work.\n\n[More info](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignition_magneto#Aviation)"},

{"title":"ELI5: the differences between alternating current and direct current in regards to electricity.","question_detail":"Electricity always confused me. Just curious about the differences, pros, and cons of each. Feel free to add any additional information they may be useful. ","answer":"Basically AC and DC refers to the flow of electrons, in AC the electrons change direction sinusoidally (Think wavey sine curve). In the UK the frequency is 50Hz, in America land it is 60Hz (I think?). In DC the electrons will carry on flowing around the circuit without changing direction, they will not show the same up and down pattern like AC. \n\nAC is used to transmit power over long distances for a few reasons. Firstly, electricity comes out of the generator at the power station as AC. Secondly, it's easier to 'step' up and down the voltage of AC electricity to convert high voltage/low current to high curren/low voltage. To transmit over long distances, AC offers the advantage because resistive losses are minimised with the use of high voltages."},

So I guess what my question is how?","answer":"Suppose you took an orange and split it into 8 wedges.  Then, if you take every other wedge, and scoot all of those wedges to the side, you'll get two half-oranges that kind of look like [the Umbrella logo](http://i.imgur.com/fMLbA.png).  Half of the \"orange\" would be empty, half would be from the original orange.  Walking around the circumference of these half-oranges would give \"orange-empty-orange-empty-orange-empty-orange-empty\".\n\nNow suppose you split the orange into 16 wedges and did the same thing.  Then each wedge and each empty space would be smaller still.\n\nNow suppose you split the orange into a billion such wedges.  Each half-orange would look like a very dense collection of very thin orange wedges.  Assuming that your knife was very sharp, and the orange didn't fall into a heap of pulpy mess, each half-orange would look very similar to the orange you began with, since the gaps between the orange wedges are very small.\n\nIf you were to perform this for an infinite amount of wedges, and kept everything in math-land where knives are infinitely sharp and orange construction is infinitely precise, then the gaps between adjacent wedges would go to 0 and you get two exact copies of the orange you began with.\n\nThe above argument is not exactly what's going on in the Banach-Tarski paradox, because they get away with only using a finite number of segments, whereas I just used an infinite number of orange slices.  The real proof instead assumes that each of the finite pieces are infinite scatterings of points rather than traditional solids, and the proof gets a little more complicated, but this is the general idea."},

That still doesn't explain anything for me. I've also been told that time travel works, essentially, by accelerating until the aging process is slowed. In that case, how is cryostasis not time travel?","answer":"In regards to the speed of light think of it this way.\n\nIf you were to be driving in a car at 100mph and I were to throw a ball beside you at 110mph it would appear as if it's going 10mph to you, the balls speed - your speed. The same goes that if I throw it at you it will appear to be coming at you at 210mph, your speed + the balls speed.\nIf you were to be travelling at close to the speed of light, say 2.8*10^8m/s, and I were to shoot light beside you it would appear to be travelling the speed of light, not your speed - the lights speed.

Thank you. Now I have another question though.\n\nIf you were to be born an American citizen and by at least 2 generations back is American born too, it will be quite hard to get Dual-Citizenship? If there are countries that allow this, which ones?","answer":"Each country sets, separately, its own rules for who is born a citizen, how a non-citizen may become a citizen, and how a citizen may lose their citizenship.  \n\nThe rules between countries are not at all coordinated; the USA doesn't ask Mexico to comment or approve on US citizenship law, or vice-versa.  Because of this, there are situations where a person may be a citizen of more than one country according to each of those countries' laws.  For example, somebody born of one American and one Canadian parent is an American citizen at birth by US law, and a Canadian citizen at birth by Canadian law.\n\nUsually each country, when dealing with dual citizens, just pretends that the person is just a citizen of that one country; so US law, for example, does not \"recognize\" dual citizenship in the sense that dual citizens are simply treated as any US citizen, with all of the rights and obligations.  So for example, for tax purposes you can't escape obligations by claiming that you're a citizen of a different country if you're also a US citizen.\n\nNote that multiple citizenship isn't necessarily something that a person seeks out; it's something that they may have involuntarily.  For example, many Iranians fled political persecution after the Iranian Revolution of 1979, and many of them came to the USA and became naturalized US citizens.  As part of naturalization, you swear to renounce all other citizenships you haveâbut of course, since each nation sets its own citizenship laws separately, just because you renounce Iranian citizenship in an American naturalization ceremony doesn't mean that Iran recognizes you as no longer their citizen.  Here's, for example, [the US State Department warning about this](http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/tw/tw_5703.html):\n\n&gt; Dual national Iranian-American citizens may encounter difficulty in departing Iran.  [...]  U.S. citizens of Iranian origin should consider the risk of being targeted by authorities before planning travel to Iran. Iranian authorities deny the U.S. Interests Section in Tehran access to imprisoned dual national Iranian-American citizens because Iranian authorities consider them to be solely Iranian citizens [...]  The Iranian government does not recognize dual citizenship and will not allow the Swiss to provide protective services for U.S. citizens who are also Iranian nationals.\n\nA similar issue has happened several times with Korean-Americans who go on a trip to South Korea only to find that, unknown to them, the government there considers them citizens and that they are obligated to enroll for military service.  (This is, by the way, why the crazies who claim Obama can't be president because he is or was once a dual citizen of the USA and Kenya are wrong.  Natural born US citizens who have a second citizenship can be President of the USA because US law does not recognize dual citizenship.  This is the right rule to have because you can be a citizen of another country without wanting to if that country's laws say you are.)\n\nSo how do you get multiple citizenships?  You just do whatever you need to do to get citizenship for multiple countries.  Complications:\n\n1. Some countries may require you to renounce other citizenships before acquiring theirs.\n2. The countries whose citizenship you renounce might recognize the surrender of citizenship, or they might not."},

The only way to cut diamonds is with other diamonds. For other materials they usually get their strength after some sort of treatment. Take steel for example. Raw steel is relatively malleable and easy to form. If you bake the steel, and then dunk it quickly into cold water (called quenching) then it becomes much harder. So first you form the steel then you quench it, and now you have a strong product. Different materials require different types of treatment, but once you figure out what it is you can now make stronger machines that might be able to form the tougher material even after treating it."},
{"title":"ELI5: How do patents work and what is involved with obtaining one?","question_detail":"I am interested in an easy to understand explanation of how one gets a patent (and the costs involved) and the different types of patents. ","answer":"If you're interested in getting a patent you also have to consider the cons. My understanding is that if you get a patent, the design is public for anyone to see. The patent protects you from other people using your design as-is to create the same product, but they are able to modify it enough that it doesn't breach your patent and then market it.\n\nFor some things that isn't an issue - for example, if you've designed a \"better mousetrap\" someone can probably reverse engineer it anyway. For other things it might be bad. If I'm not mistaken, companies like Coca Cola, KFC, etc don't have patents and instead keep their products as \"trade secrets\". That's where things like industrial espionage come into play; the products aren't protected by patents, so if you can somehow get the trade secrets you can legally reproduce it."},

Even the mainstream X rated films of the time (Midnight Cowboy, Behind the Green Door, Debbie Does Dallas) didn't show actual penetration or the money shot. The underground porn films did and the cops thought they could bust the participants for prostitution. \n\nThe case went to the Supreme Court. The Court basically said that they won't mess with \"art\" whatever that is, but the law read that prostitution involves paying someone for your or their sexual gratification. Look at the shooting schedule of a pornographer, the lighting arrangements, the hassle of non-existant erections, and you see that the person doing the paying is the only person who is not getting off. \n\nWhat the Supreme Court did, in essence, was make it legal to make porn in California. No other district wants to try because they don't want to have a lot of porn makers in their hometown. "},
{"title":"ELI5 the structure and hierarchy of the Catholic church.  ","answer":"There are basically three types of people in the eyes of the Catholic church: bishops, priests, and plebs (Well actually you could add a fourth: unbelievers. But let's overlook them because they're on the outside.)\n\nLet's start at the bottom first: to become a basic card-carrying member of the church, you need to be baptised, confirmed, and had your first communion. Then you're in and set for (after-)life. (They don't actually give you a card though.)\n\nBut in order to keep the people, the buildings, the community in check (and also to perform special holy rituals like baptism and confirmation, plus others like administering the last rites and exorcisms) (Ho yeah you read that one right!) you need more than just ordinary Christian laity. You need a separate class: a holy class. (Why do you *need* that? Cos God sez so. Who says God sez so? The holy class. Ah I see. You see? I see.)\n\nBottom rung there is the typical common or garden variety priest, who lives like part of a local community. He takes care of his own parish, which is a small area about the size of a town or so. So grassroots stuff.\n\nThat priest has a boss he has to report to: the bishop. And the parish is only a small part of a larger domain: the diocese. (Parish : Priest :: Diocese : Bishop.)\n\nThat bishop has greater religious power than a priest, but he's basically one who proved himself as a very excellent fellow who was deserving of the promotion. Yes, the Catholic church has a career path like the Sims.\n\nBishops in turn report to other bishops who get called archbishops or primates. Those guys' stomping ground is called a province.\n\nAbove them (although they don't report to them as such) are the cardinals. The cardinals all hang out in Rome and act as advisors to the big cheese himself: the Pope.\n\nAnd the POPE is...kind of a big deal.\n\nOk! All clear?\n\nNow let's do it again, only start at the top this time.\n\nWay back when, Jesus founded a church. Yeah! That guy! He had a message and followers and all. You may have heard of him? Maybe because of that message thing?\n\nNow if we were all super-divine, we could see the universe as it exists outside of time and recognise that Jesus is always and ever was and will be the head of the church. But we don't have enough shrooms for everyone to see things that way, so instead the big man made things easy for us upon his death by passing his leadership on to his disciple Peter.\n\nSo Peter was the first pope. (There's a pun in there about \"the rock on which my church was built\" and his tomb being underneath the Vatican...yeah, don't bother. It wasn't even funny the first time.) The Pope is the temporal head of the church and God's representative upon this green earth. He's the guy who makes sure everything's running according to plan. On every pope's death, a new one gets elected to take his place, which makes sense right?\n\nThis was a fine system, but as the church grew it became impossible for the pope and his homies to look after every community under their care. So before long they started delegating and bingo: hierarchy. Bishops and priests and all that whatnot.\n\nNow if things were straightforward that'd be that, but there's a whole heap of developments happened in between that (particular account of) history and today, so as you can imagine things have gotten a little...complicated. But essentially Rome became the seat of the church and had to do a lot of fighting to establish the orthodoxy of the church and that emphasis continues to this day. So even though there're only three types of people in the church, it *feels* like there are four: the laity, the priests, the bishops, and the cardinals/Pope/Rome.\n\n**TL;DR** [Laity] -&gt; [Priest] -&gt; [Bishop -&gt; Archbishop -&gt; Cardinal -&gt; Pope] -&gt; [GOD]\n\n(This is the redux version. I didn't even mention how monks, nuns, deacons, patriarchs, etc etc etc. fit in. Be glad. You can't maintain an organisation for 2000 years and *not* end up with a ridiculously byzantine structure.)"},

When you are less dense than the stuff around you will float or rise.\n\n&gt; What does any of that have to do with wind? Well, the Sun heats the Earth and the hot Earth then warms the air right next to the Earth's surface. The warm air expands and then rises. As the warm air rises the near by air comes rushing in to feel the empty space. That rushing air is wind.\n\n&gt;That is really over simplified, but it gives you a start. Do not read any more if you are happy with the explanation so far and do not want to go down the rabbit hole any more.\n\n&gt;Also related is the fact that the equator gets more direct sun than the poles so the air near the equator is heated more than the air near the poles. that means the air near the equator will rise up more than the air near the poles.\n\n&gt;This will cause a circulation of air rising up from the equator and flowing toward the poles, with the low cooler air from the poles will move toward the equator to fill the gap left by the rising air.\n\n&gt;Now mix in the fact that the earth has a \"right hand\" rotation and the air will bend toward the west as it moves toward the poles, this will cause a counter clockwise rotation in the north and clock wise rotation in the south.\n\n&gt;Now also figure that the air over water heats differently than air over land and all kinds of crazy weather patterns can emerge.\n\n&gt;You can also explain why there seem to be desserts on land the same distance from the equator in both directions from the above circulations (at about 30 degrees).\n\n&gt;tl;dr Heat rises, cool air rushes in."},
{"title":"Do you ever actually touch anything?","question_detail":"Last year I learned about atoms and all the cool stuff that is and like isn't the only way your hand or something can't go through a door because the atoms in your fingers repel the atoms of the door so your hand stops. So if at the atomic level it's magnetic repulsion, are we ever truly touching something? Or are we just feeling the resistance from our atoms? Idk if that made any sense but if someone out there understood it and could explain it to me i would love you.","answer":"Yes, when you touch something your atoms aren't actually coming into physical contact with the atoms of whatever you're touching. There is a bit of space in between and you feel the force of the electrons in your hand repelling the electrons in whatever it is you touch."},
{"title":"ELI5: Allergies? Specifically like a peanut allergy!? How is it deadly?! Evolutionary what does it serve?","answer":"As no one has tackled this important point yet, let me mention: the portion of the immune system that medicatemenow describes - and fairly accuratly - involving mast cells and type E immunoglobulin is **intended to fight off parasites** of a larger nature then bacteria.  Aggressive protists, worms, and various other infectious parasites are targeted and attacked by the immune system in ways not unlike how bacterial infection is fought, but with more specialized tools.\n\nAn allergy is essentially what happens when this system misfires, targeting things like pollen or peanut oil as a parasite and causing inflammation (and so forth), which can become deadly if extreme.  There are several studies that suggest that this is due to the system being largely unused in modern culture.\n\nBasically, because the modernized cultures of the world live cleanly, the chance of parasitic infection for us is rather low; given that, the anti-parasite portion of our immune system is only rarely challenged.  It is thought that this may lead to the system overreacting when presented with rather minor stimuli as mentioned.\n\nThis is supported by an interesting medical use of parasites - in some patients which have allergies, if they are infected by a parasite (say, an intestinal worm) their allergies lessen or vanish.  Similarly, the incidence of allergies is less in regions which frequently encounter parasites.\n\nSo there's your answer - its evolutionary purpose is an anti-para cite system which can become hypersensitive.  The basic mechanism of their working is the activation of certain granulocytes like mast cells which release antibodies and particles which stimulate inflammation, which in turn can be harmful in extreme cases to the organism.\n\nAny questions?"},

{"title":"ELI5: In physics, what is \"action\"?","question_detail":"Apparently it has the units J *  s (or kg * m^2 * s^-1), so I figure it should be just another quantity like force, energy, momentum, pressure, etc. Planck's constant is apparently a tiny bit of action, so it seems quite important to get a grasp of what action is before trying to understand anything about quantum mechanics and such. The wikipedia article for it is horrendous at explaining it.","answer":"ELI15, because a 5-year-old doesn't need to know:  Action is the integral of kinetic energy over time.  It is important because, as discovered in the 19th century, mechanical processes generally *minimize* the total action of the moving parts of the process.  That is a huge discovery and led to Lagrangian mechanics, which more or less reduces all possible problems in classical mechanics to simple plug-and-chug (it gives something close to a closed-form solution, to practically any dynamics problem that can be solved).\n\nNobody really understood the action-minimization principle (in the sense of knowing why the Universe would act like that) until the advent of quantum mechanics.  It turns out that *energy* and *frequency* are closely related -- all elementary wave functions oscillate with a frequency proportional to the kinetic energy of the system.  That means the wave functions end up with a *phase shift* that is proprtional to the action.  \n\nThat's pretty cool, and is the underlying physical principle that drives IAmMe1's answer: physical wave functions tend to take paths that leave *stationary* *phase* -- i.e. the final phase of the wave function is the same between several nearby alternative paths through spacetime.  Paths like that usually either minimize or maximize the action, for the same reason that most stationary points in functions f(x) that you are likely to encounter are the extrema of f(x) -- local maxima or minima: in order to be a local maximum or minimum of f(x), a point *has* to be a stationary point of f(x), while it would be a huge coincidence for any non-extremal point to be stationary.\n\n"},
{"title":"ELI5: Why do clothes wrinkle?","question_detail":"What causes wrinkling in clothes? How are clothes made to be wrinkle-free? How do some dryers have a wrinkle-free setting?","answer":"Cotton is a planet-based fiber, which is generally very strong and flexible. The fibers hold their shape well, and are very durable. But it also absorbs water really well. When they absorb water, they swell and become limp, like a sponge.\n\nWhen the water leaves, the fiber goes back to it's rigid state. Unless the fibers are smoothed out and flattened, they will dry in whatever shape they're currently holding which is how creases/wrinkles form.\n\nIroning works like this: steam or water is applied to the fabric. The fibers absorb the water and become floppy again. The hot iron presses the fabric smooth and dries it out so they become rigid again.\n\nWrinkle-free shirts are chemically treated so they're basically water-proofed; the fibers can't absorb water so they won't swell/dry out/wrinkle.\n\nI don't know about wrinkle-free dryers settings."},
{"title":"[ELI5] Why does currency loose on value when demand exceeds supply?","question_detail":"and why does it gain if supply on the market exceeds demand?\n","answer":"Bear in mind that what you are referring to is *aggregate* supply and demand, which are really very different concepts from the supply and demand that we talk about in micro. They look a little bit the same, but they're real different.\n\njoshyelon did a good job of explaining it. Just remember that when the price level goes up, that's exactly the same as saying that the value of money has gone down, and vice versa. If all prices double tomorrow then the money in your bank account buys exactly half of what it would have bought today. Your money has halved in value. And when you draw the AS/AD diagram, you've got *price level* on the horizontal axis. So go ahead, draw an AD curve and a short run AS curve, and then move the AD curve to the right, which corresponds to an increase in aggregate demand. The price level moves up along the AS curve, and the equilibrium price level ends up higher than it was with the old AD level."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why do phone companies issue phone numbers rather than static IP addresses?","answer":"because phone numbers and IP Adresses are basically the same thing, they are numbers used to identify you on a network, Phone numbers were created to be used to reach somebody on a cellular network, which existed before the internet. when the internet was created they needed a way to separate machines like the cell network needed ways to separate phones, so they invented IP Adresses to serve pretty much the same purpose as phone numbers.\n\nNow as for why the cell companies hasn't changed from phone numbers to IP adresses after the internet became popular is because first of all there was and still is no need to do so since phone numbers work well for people and they are not in short supply, secondly changing phone numbers to IP adresses would break compatibility with pretty much all cell network equipment and phones."},

Like if I drop an egg from 1 m, it'll probably crack, but if I drop an egg in a spongy-case, the impulse is higher so the impact force is lower (Impulse = F*deltaT).\n\nI just don't see how these plastic cases really make a difference, especially for non-iPhones that don't have glass backs.  Does it have something to do with the hardness of glass?","answer":"Everything you said so far is correct.

{"title":"ELI5 Why/how is the electoral college still relevant in the current political structure?","question_detail":"I've never understood the point of voting when the popular opinion does not matter, and how the electoral college plays a role in the current political structure","answer":"The electoral college was invented as a compromise for the smaller states who would just get crushed in a popular vote. It is still effective for that purpose.\n\nThe thing you have to remember about this issue is that there ARE semi-independent states in our country, 50 of them. This is **key** because funding goes out to the states themselves and not directly to the people. Think about it this way: You could make a lot of people happy in a hurry if you promised the most populated states more money than the rest. (Yes they could do that now, but the electoral college helps prevent this exact thing.)\n\nIf it was a popular vote huge swaths of the country would have almost no say in electing a president. All the money would go to urban development, mass transit, and city parks. (Not too much of an exaggeration, really.)\n\nSmaller states have a bigger say in the election of the president than is proportional to their population. I figured in ND their vote is worth about 4 times a Californian's vote. That's because they get the 2 Senators on top of their (1) electoral college rep. This is a way of mitigating the power that highly populated staes already have. (You guys have the House to begin with!)\n\nI live in ND and have never once had our state support the candidate I voted for. I still support the electoral college becasue although we have to decide together, once we decide we can bring more force to bear. In essence, we are greater than the sum of our parts with the electoral college."},

Why? ","answer":"\"Muscle contractions are stimulated by electrical currents that flow\nthroughout the body via minerals including sodium and potassium.  Each\nmuscle cell contraction involves a lightning-fast exchange in which\npotassium molecules inside the muscle cell and sodium molecules\noutside the muscle cell switch places.

{"title":"Does lightning strike the surface of large bodies of water(pools, lakes, oceans, retention ponds, etc.), and what effect does it have?","question_detail":"It seems kind of obvious since water is a conductor, but what if it's enclosed in a material that doesnt conduct? ","answer":"I'm going to give this a try based on my limited understanding of electricity. If I'm wrong on any of this, please feel free to correct me.\n\nLightning happens when there is an imbalance of positive/negative electrons in a cloud than on the ground or in other clouds. The electrons jump from one to the other to balance themselves out, which is what lightning is.\n\nWhen electrons jump, they want to do it as easily as possible (yeah I know I'm anthropomorphizing electricity... sue me). When they are trying to get to the ground, that means looking for something nearby (tall) and something conductive. Conductive just means that it's a material that electricity can pass through easily. Things like metal and water are very good conductors, but things like rubber and wood are not (they're called insulators). The reason trees get struck by lightning even though they are made of wood is because they have a lot of water inside of them, and water is a good conductor.\n\nWhen you have a large, flat surface like an ocean, the electrons still need to get to the ground, but there aren't always tall objects to help them. (This is one of the reasons it's dangerous to be on a boat in a lake during a thunderstorm - your boat might be the tallest thing around!)\n\nSo, yes - lighting can strike large bodies of water, and is able to travel efficiently to the ground. \n\n(I could be wrong about the next part)\nSo, let's say that there is a giant sea of water, but it's completely enclosed in rubber, which electricity can't travel through. The lightning still needs to travel to the ground, but it can't use the water to get there because it's not grounded. (Grounded means that electricity can travel through it to the ground.) Theoretically, lightning would not strike that body of water - it's needs to get to a destination, and that water can't help it get there.\n\nI think it would be similar to lightning striking a flying airplane: airplanes are usually made of metal, which is a very good conductor, and they're also closer to the clouds than almost anything else. However, they're not grounded. Sometimes lightning will \"hit\" an airplane, but it travels around the fuselage (made of metal) and keeps going towards the ground or towards other clouds. The people and instruments are not affected because the electricity had no reason to go through them - it was simply traveling to a destination and happened to travel around a plane on its way there. \n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: How glow-in-the-dark plastics \"store\" light","question_detail":"Why is it that glow-in-the-dark materials have to be \"charged\" by placing them under light before they'll glow?  Why is it that *any* light source will charge these materials equally as fast as any other (sunlight vs fluorescent light, etc)?","answer":"They're actually storing the *energy* from light and re-emitting it at a slightly lower energy. If the incoming light has wavelength(1) and the outgoing light wavelength(2), wavelength(1)&lt;wavelength(2). This corresponds to energy(1)&gt;energy(2).\n\nAnyway: all matter(substance) is made of atoms and molecules. Molecules are collections of atoms connected by electron interactions. Atoms consist of a nucleus (protons and neutrons) which are orbited by electrons. If light of sufficient energy (i.e. low enough wavelength) for a particular electron in that substance to be excited hits the substance, the electron can be promoted to what's called an *excited state*. For atoms, this can be visualised as the electron gaining enough energy to move slightly further away from the nucleus.\n\nWhen the electron is in it's excited state it can do a bunch of things. One of them is to vibrate and lose it's energy as heat. Another is to \"flip it's electron the other way round\" (changes it's spin; [intersystem crossing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersystem_crossing)). Another is to lose it's energy as light again - it emits a photon of lower energy than that which excited it (some of the energy was lost in vibrations etc.).\n\nNow, we've various different excited states. Put simply, one is where the electron spin is the same as it was before, one is where the spin has been flipped. If a photon is emitted from the originial spin state we have [fluorescence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florescence). If it's emitted from the state with the spin flipped then we have [phosphorescence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorescence).\n\nFluorescence occurs faster than phosphorescence, but the light usually has a shorter wavelength (higher energy). Why does it occur faster? Because the excited state with the original electron spin is *less stable* than that with the spin flipped. This is because electrons pair together with opposite spins (eg. +1 and -1) when they're in the same orbital/state, but when one of them is excited and they're in different states (one in the *ground* state and one in the *excited* state) it is more stable to be *spin parallel* (eg. +1 and +1). So flipping the spin makes it more stable - a *metastable* excited state.\n\nAs to why charging is the same for different light sources, technically it isn't, BUT it's because the incoming light (photons) only has to be of sufficient energy to excite the electron in the fluorescent materials you've seen. It just so happens that the fluorescent materials you've seen have been designed so that \"sunlight\" and \"fluorescent light\" and anything that the consumer would use will cause fluorescence/phosphorescence to occur. See the [electromagnetic spectrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum) for the energy of different lightsources.\n\nHowever, if you go to really high energy light (such as a gamma ray) you might actually stop fluorescence/phosphorescence from occuring because you have so much energy that rather than become excited, the electron just leaves. And if the light is of really low energy, like a radio wave, it might not have enough energy to excite the electrons in the material.\n\nAs for the \"charging\", you have to place it under that light source for a while so that lots of different electrons can be excited. If you only put it there for a second then it's possible only a few of the electrons have been excited and the material won't contain so much energy yet."},
{"title":"ELI5: How the system behind web translators work and what are the challenges to make them more accurate?","answer":"Some work by basically breaking down the sentences you put into the translator and sort them by various grammar rules, then reversing this process with words with meanings close to them in the language you want (sentence -&gt; types of words -&gt; find the definition of word you wanted -&gt; swap word out for the word that seems to fit best in another language -&gt; re-builds sentence out of the new words based on the new languages' grammar). This can be bad because many words have multiple meanings, slang of any kind will not translate, and some words don't have translations that work the same way in different languages (such as the \"a\" sometimes placed before names in Spanish). The other kind of translator uses statistics that the translator derives from massive amounts of language data, such as software documentation that is professionally translated into multiple languages, to find patterns in how humans translate language and uses those statistics to find the translation that is most likely accurate. It works by taking the sentence, looking up the same sentence or the most similar one to it and giving you back the translation that was deemed the most statistically likely to be correct. The problems that this type faces are: if an incorrect translation is statistically common, it may be used instead of the correct one, and grammar is often skewed because it doesn't really check verb tense or mood, and doesn't often translate that with it, so result may be like \"I was run to the park\" instead of \"I was running to the park\", and the less you translate at once, the more unreliable the translator becomes. If you use that type of translator to translate an entire page of a language, it is usually pretty accurate, but it is extremely unreliable for single words, mainly because of the \"multiple definitions\" problem, as well as synonyms and other things that can skew the data, and getting large enough amounts of data to create an accurate translator of this sort is also extremely difficult."},

That said, a lot of them can be simplified down into common problems and then how they successfully (or unsuccessfully) dealt with them.\n\nBuilding things often requires huge capital expenditures on factories, machinery and other physical assets. If you're in the car business, you have to spend billions to ramp up to the point where you can produce a certain number of cars. If you've spent the money to be able to produce 10 million cars a year, but since the economy has hit tough times, you're only able to sell 5 million cars per year... you've got a serious problem. You still have to pay for all that equipment whether you need it or not. and it isn't easy to sell car-making-equipment to other companies when they're in the same boat as you. \n\nThen you get other dilemmas - like a company that is growing too quickly. Sometimes you'll get a product that is so hugely in demand that a company has to grow incredibly fast to keep up. But is it a good thing to spend lots of money (which you probably don't have) to ramp up, or to ride it out as best you can because it's hard to say whether the good times will continue forever.\n\nThen there are ethical dilemmas.

This involves adjusting the tempos and keys of songs to match each other, as well as recognizing certain aspects of the songs that go well together. \n\nA DJ may also \"cut\" during a song, which means they use turntables to produce a distinctive scratching sound. \n\nDJ's also use their equipment to add certain effects to songs such as delay, reverb, or equalizer. They often remix popular songs, adding their own effects and beats. \n\nHowever, the amount that a DJ \"does\" during a performance depends on the individual. Some insist on adding effects and mixing songs live, while others have a pre-prepared set. "},
{"title":"ELI5: OP-amps","question_detail":"I know that there are multiple functions for operational amplifiers, but I would like to understand how they perform some basic functions. I know some different terms(inverting, non-inverting, summing) but I don't understand what they do or how they work.","answer":"A differential OpAmp is essentially a three terminal device (not counting the power supplies):  a (+) input, a (-) input, and the output. The OpAmp will drive the output depending on the difference between the + and - inputs. An OpAmp has very very high voltage gain, so a very tiny difference between the inputs will make a huge signal at the output. So much so that if nothing else is done, the output will tend to be at its maximum positive or negative range, depending on which of the two inputs is larger, even with a very small difference. So in this mode, it can be used as a \"comparator\".   \n  \nComparators are useful, but OpAmps have many other uses. Typically the output is tied back to one of the inputs in a fashion that provides negative feedback. Doing this allows the OpAmp to implement a variety of different functions, where the OpAmp acts more like a traditional amplifier. It is easy to make active filter circuits, differentiators, integrators, level detectors, etc.   \n  \nUsing an OpAmp simplifies circuit design because you can just \"drop in\" an amplifier into your circuit without having to worry about a lot of the details of designing the amplifier, and can instead focus on what you want the overall circuit to accomplish. For example, an idealized OpAmp has infinite input impedance, which makes a lot of circuit analysis simpler. "},

{"title":"Why do we have a terminal velocity? ","question_detail":"I went skydiving recently and wondered why we(or any object) have a terminal velocity.","answer":"Moving air exerts a force; you know this if you've ever been blown over by a gust of wind (or if you've ever seen a sailboat).  Once air is blowing fast enough, the force it exerts equally balances the force exerted by gravity.  When this happens, you don't accelerate any more.\n\nWhen you skydove, you would have had a parachute.  When you deployed it, you increased the force of air, thus slowing your terminal velocity to a safe level that you could easily land on.\n\nA corollary of this is that if there were no air, there would be NO terminal velocity, and you would accelerate until you hit something.  If you tried to skydive on the moon, your parachute would do nothing, and you would smash into the moon at an extreme rate of speed."},

{"title":"ELI5: Cylinders in cars, the engine Liters and how this affects fuel consumption. ","question_detail":"I am looking at buying my first car and I am kind of confused with how many liters the engine is and the cylinders and how baby liters of fuel it will use.\n\ne.g. Two of the same cars. One has a 4 cylinder 2.1L engine. And the other has a 6 cylinder 3.0L engine.\nWith fuel being so over priced at the moment, this will affect my choice with cars.\n\nCheers","answer":"The actual Litre size/cylinder number doesn't matter in theory.\n\n\nI will make the assumption that both cars use regular unleaded gasoline.  Gasoline is necessary for combustion along with air (oxygen).  For regular unleaded gasoline, there is specific mixture where you use all of the gasoline and all of the air in a tiny explosion, and none is left over.\n\n\nImagine that you have a blimp full of air but only a tablespoon of gasoline.  If you mix the air and the gasoline and toss in a match, there will be a small explosion, but most of the air will still be in the blimp while all of the gas is used up.  It's the same idea if you have a large amount of gasoline but only a tiny amount of air.  You will have an explosion that uses up all of the air but not all of the gas.\n\n\nThere is a perfect mixture, let's just say 1/2 gas and 1/2 air that, when ignited, will use up all of the air and all of the gasoline at the same time.  This is the most effecient in a car engine because the engine does *just enough* work to bring air in, but doesn't waste any energy bringing in too much.\n\n\n\nThat being said, all cars are controlled by a computer chip so that the mixture is near that perfect amount.  Whether you have a 3.0L or a 2.1L, they will have the same mixture ratios as long as they use the same type of gasoline.  \n\n\n\nNow what that number, 2.1L or 3.0L actually describes is how much air is drawn into the engine every time the pistons complete a stroke.  If a 4 cylinder is 2.1L, that means that each piston pulls in .525L of air individually.  If the perfect mixture is 1/2 air and 1/2 gas like we said, then the engine will also use 2.1L of gas with each stroke.\n\n\nThe 3.0L on the other hand, would use 3.0L of gas with each stroke...but that doesn't make it less effecient.  The extra gas and air used in the 3.0L engine will result in a more powerful explosion, and thus more power to the car.\n\n\n\nSo...theoretically, it's the same.  But in reality, smaller displacement cars are made more fuel effecient because you don't actually *use* all of the power a 3.0L gives you.  You could make an engine that is 1 Billion Litres that would be just as \"effecient\" as a 2.1L, but a single stroke would use enough gasoline to get you to the moon.  If you only need to go down the block, it's overkill.\n\n\n\nAlso...5 year olds wouldn't ask a question like this so you didn't really get an answer for a 5yo."},
{"title":"why does it seem like supply and demand are \nbackwards in some in some industries?","question_detail":"Supply and demand *should* regulate pricing. But it now seems that in some industries the reason for upping the price (example Cable) is because people aren't using as much. How does this work?","answer":"Your question is one about the economic concept of *elasticity*.\n\nAn elastic good is one where supply and demand track closely; if supply goes up and demand stays the same, price goes down and vice versa.\n\nAn inelastic good is one where the supply and demand don't see to track that closely. For instance, US gas prices go up, but people keep consuming the same amount of gas.\n\nThe industry you refer to is one that is currently being \"disintermediated\". This is a fancy word for saying that a business like the cable company makes money by acting as an intermediary between two parties. In this case, the cable company takes shows and movies from show and movie makers, and distributes it to you.\n\nHowever, with the web and ever faster speeds, many people are \"cutting the cord\" to their cable company. Some customers simply don't need cable companies any more to get the shows they want, they can download them off the web. Hence, the intermediary is no longer necessary.\n\nIf they perceive their service to be inelastic, which to some extent it is, they'll keep raising the price until demand goes down and their profits suffer. This is exactly what happens in reverse when competitors enter a market and they go through several rounds of trying to undercut each others' prices. At some point that stops as well."},
{"title":"ELI 5: How do good quality digital cameras remove \"red eyes\" from photos?","answer":"In addition to what afcagroo said, there is another method commonly used:\n\nRed eye in a photo is caused by light from the camera's flash reflected off of the back of your eye (the inside of it) and back into the lens.  It is red because of the blood vessels back there.  \n\nIf you turn on the red eye reduction before taking a photo, you'll likely notice a bunch of flashes that happen right before the picture is taken, in addition to the one that happens *while* it's being taken.  Those initial flashes are meant to overload your eyes and make your pupils shrink way down before the picture snaps.

Does anyone have a great explanation?\nThanks.","answer":"PureStealth's blog looks very detailed and well-researched. You should definitely check it out, but if you want a more TL;DR version:\n\nThe nuclei of large atoms are inherently unstable. If you \"shoot\" a neutron into certain kinds, they will be pushed over the edge and split into two (or more) smaller nuclei. If you add up the masses of these new nuclei, you find that a little bit of the original is missing. This was the **binding energy**, which was released in the reaction. This teeny tiny bit of mass became an enormous amount of energy, according to Einstein's famous equation E = mc^2.\n\nSometimes, nuclear fissions will also release more neutrons, which each have a chance of triggering another fission reaction nearby - a **chain reaction**. If the reaction is **supercritical**, the number of neutrons being generated is greater than the number being consumed, and the whole thing can quickly go out of control. If fewer are being generated, it's **subcritical**. In a nuclear reactor, we want the sweet spot where they are exactly equal - **critical**. We can use **control rods** to absorb some of the neutrons to get the balance exactly right."},

I came across this newly designed website for Disney's California Adventure the other day and was curious about how it worked. From what I can tell it appears to be some kind of Javascript. The site becomes animated as you scroll down. I've never seen anything like this before so I thought it would be nice to know how it is done in a way that I can understand. Thanks Reddit!\n\nhttp://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneys-california-adventure/","answer":"A nice thing about reddit is that they made their software open source. That roughly means that their software has to be freely available. So they host their code at [github](https://github.com/reddit/reddit). That's where I get most of my information about how reddit exactly works.\n\nThe first thing you have to understand is how a website (in this case reddit) gets to your browser. This works as following:\nImagine Alice, the browser, speaking to Bob, the reddit server: \"Hello Bob, I'm Alice, please give me the site /r/explainlikeimfive/\". Bob responds: \"Ok, I got this site, let it show me to you\". Now Bob hands out all the html files, css files, javascript files, images, etc. to Alice. Because Bob knows Alice, he will give her some nice pink css styles and a picture of her as profile image.\nNow I go a bit more in detail for what Bob does. Bob is like an accountant: At home he has got some huge shelves with folders full of reddit posts and similar stuff. For example: He has a folder named \"Alice\". In that folder there is a page with personal stuff (i.e. username and password, etc.) and some other pages for custom things like: \"Alice wants her front page to be pink and additionally only showing /r/askredit/ and /r/explainlikeimfive/\". That's why Bob knows what to hand Alice out when she requests the site. But that's not the only thing Bob does. For example he also has got a folder that contains all the information about which subreddits exists what their names are and so on. But it is important to say that Bob doesn't really care about how all these posts, subreddits, etc. will actually look like for Alice. He has got some folders describing how the site could look like (i.e. css-stylesheets, etc.), though, and most friends of Bob including Alice will make the site look like almost exactly as described, but Bob really doesn't care about this.\nBut that was not the end. Alice was ready to see the things Bob gave here. So she gets a page from a folder that reads, that the title of the site is \"Explain like I'm five\" (that would be the HTML-site). She also has got another page that reads \"All normal text should be blue with a pink background. Additionally headings should be bold and twice as big as the normal text\" (that would be the HTML-Site). And because Alice and Bob are fancy and that is not enough, she gets a third page, reading \"If you click on that image make it bounce back and forth and when you type something in the search bar go ask Bob for interim results before even clicking on 'search'\" (that would be the javascript stuff). As you can see, those instructions are not really precise. That's the reason why some other friends (i.e. other browsers) will get a slightly different version of the site.\n\nThat was a broad overview of how reddit (or any other site) works. Feel free to ask if you want to know stuff more detailed (I could easily write a text twice as long about technical details if you are interested)."},

{"title":"ELI5: How do amphetamines such as Adderall and Ritalin work and why do they sometimes trigger anxiety?","answer":"Amphetamines and similar substances (methamphetamine, methylphenidate, etc.) act by causing dopamine to \"pool\" in the brain. Dextroamphetamine (Adderall, Vyvanse) is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, which is what causes this build up of dopamine. I'll assume you know what dopamine is, so in addition to being a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, dextroamphetamine (and other similar substances) also cause elevated heart rates due to a drastic increase in epinephrine and norepinephrine.\n \nAlso, just for the record, methylphenidate (Ritalin) can cause blood vessels to constrict, which can lead to headaches. Cocaine does the same thing, because cocaine and methylphenidate are extremely similar, only coke is helluva lot more powerful (and addicting, by extension.) On a somewhat related topic, dextromethamphetamine has basically identical effects to dextroamphetamine, only much more powerful, and, by my understanding, dextromethamphetamine causes a cascading release of dopamine and subsequently blocks the reuptake of it, whereas dextroamphetamine just does the latter (which is why even small doses of dextromethamphetamine can cause euphoria, whereas higher doses of dextroamphetamine don't usually cause a true euphoria.)"},

{"title":"Why is soy so common in food these days?","question_detail":"Is soy just very easy to use? Does it grow with less intervention or in more climates than other plants? Is it because of subsidies? Some other reason all together?","answer":"Soy is:\n\n1.  Very common and easy to grow, so it is cheap.\n2.  Very nutritious, non-toxic and all natural, so you can claim health benefits from it without using artificial ingredients.\n3.  Very mild in flavor so you **can** add it to everything.\n4.  Very well researched, so we know how to extract and make the most out of the compounds found in the plant.\n\nIts commonness is mostly from its versatility and food companies being cheap in their recipes.  For example:\n\n* Soy lecithin is used to make things mix better, you could use lecithin from eggs, but you'd have to pay more for the feeding of chickens while soy is fed by the sun for free.  \n* Soybean oil is highly processed so it will stay stable for a long period of time extending your product's shelf life.\n* Textured vegetable protein is made from the remains of soybeans that have had their oil extracted, it is used as a high-protein meat filler, making your beef last longer, or as a meat substitute in vegetarian cooking."},

{"title":"ELI5 what led to the economy crash in 2007 and how the banks were or weren't at fault. ","question_detail":"Wondering how an what actually led to the recession and how the banks and housing bubble was involved. Any other relevant info is welcome. Thanks \n*edit for spelling*","answer":"In ELI5 language...\n\nCasey the Consumer is looking for a home. But all the homes that are for sale are way to expensive for him. He can't afford the monthly payments. So his desire for home ownership seems unattainable. There are many consumers like Casey.\n\nLisa the Loan Officer talks to Casey the Consumer, and thinks she can help. Lisa can give Casey a loan that he can afford. But since Casey can't afford much of a down payment, the terms of the loan are very strict, and he has to take more time to pay back the loan. But more time means that the loan earns more money for Lisa! There are many loan officers like Lisa.\n\nBarry the Banker sees Lisa the Loan Officer making more money on her loans. Barry tells Lisa to make more strict loans like she made for Casey. And according to the rules of banking, Barry's bank can count the profit from the whole loan right away, not just the part that Casey has paid off. There are many bankers like Barry.\n\nSally the Stock Buyer sees that Barry's bank has a whole lot more money than it had before. Sally believes that Barry's bank is doing well, and invests her money in it. But Sally also knows that Casey may not pay back his loan. So she looks for a way to hedge her bet. There are many stock buyers like Sally.\n\nDanny the Derivatives Trader has a solution for Sally. Danny can sell Sally both the stock, and a derivative. Just like buying a stock hoping the price will go up, Sally can buy a derivative in case the price goes down. That way, if the stock goes down, she can sell the derivative to get some of her money back. There are many derivatives traders like Danny.\n\nUnfortunately, Casey the consumer was not able to make the payments on his loan, so he lost his house and his credit is ruined. Lisa the Loan Officer had to foreclose on Casey's house, but nobody else is able to buy it. Barry the Banker has to subtract all of Lisa's loans that were not paid off. That means Sally loses her stock money, so she sells her derivative. But everyone else is selling their derivatives too, so they are worthless. And since derivatives are worthless, Danny goes out of business."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why is marijuana illegal?","question_detail":"I know this could end up in a huge debate but I just don't get what the reasons are that it's illegal. I think our country could tax it and benefit tremendously from it.","answer":"It's a rather complex issue in terms of reasoning, but an easily explained one - there's just a lot behind it. It's more about the history behind marijuana (cannabis) than the drug's actual effects. I'll point out the main reasons without going into too much depth. If you aren't much for reading, here's a great documentary on the subject: [The Union: The Business Behind Getting High](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HLzmH9VB6A)\n\nImmigration/Race-\nDuring the early 1900s, the US became even more anti-immigrant than before. \"Marijuana\" was popular among Mexicans and African-Americans. Making it illegal provided an excuse to arrest, deport, or encourage people to leave.\n\nAlcohol- \nIn the past as well as during modern times, the alcohol industry has been very much against recreational use of cannabis for obvious reasons. They pour significant amounts of money into anti-marijuana lobbying every year.\n\nClothing and Paper Manufacturing-\nPerhaps the greatest reason for marijuana being made illegal in the first place is due to the influence of the lumber and textile industries. Hemp, when used as a fiber can be used quite efficiently to produce paper or cloth. \n\nPolice and Prison Spending- \nThe US spends very large amounts of money on prisons and on police funding. If cannabis were to be made legal for recreational use, prisons and police departments (particularly the large ones) would receive less funding. As a number of prisons in the US are privately-owned, their owners find that lobbying against legalization is a great way to protect their businesses. If marijuana is made legal, suddenly there's significantly less people being locked up, which means profits being cut almost entirely. Look up statistics as to how many people are locked up for marijuana related offenses, you'll be unpleasantly surprised.\n\nThe Governments Historical Position- \nThe government, having taken the stance for many years that cannabis is a dangerous substance is unwilling to change its position. In addition, the position held by the government for all those years has led many Americans to believe that cannabis is a dangerous substance. Programs like D.A.R.E hinder progress as a society and create anti-legalization groups who will always vehemently oppose any attempts to legalize drugs of any kind. \n\nIn conclusion-\nAs I said before, there's a lot to it. I could write a book on the subject and not feel satisfied with my explanation. If you've got any questions though feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer. "},

{"title":"ELI5: The difference between a 32 and 64-bit operating system","question_detail":"Always been interested in the difference between these two.","answer":"The answers referring to memory addresses are mostly correct but somewhat incomplete, because the 32 or 64 bit actually refers to the processor type. A 64-bit OS only runs on 64-bit processors, a 32-bit OS is written for 32-bit processors (but also runs on 64-bit processors). So, what's the difference between those two?\nBasically a 32-bit processor handles numbers in the size of 32 bits and a 64-bit processor handles 64-bit numbers. For example, a 32-bit processor can only add 32 bit numbers. \n\nAbout the memory:\nIf we want to store some number in the memory, the processor has to know where to put that number. To do that, each byte in memory has its own address. For the processor to use that address, it has to handle it somehow, so the length of the address has to be 32 bit in a 32-bit processor, which creates the limitation of 4GiB.\n"},
{"title":"ELI5: How taste buds work","answer":"Back in the days of early human evolution (before humans even, but let's simplify this), some poor fellow found out that eating that black mushroom growing in the grass made him really sick and ended up killing him a few days later. This kept happening until human evolution started associating the taste of that mushroom as \"bad\". Now, what's bad? It's all relative, but, generally, if it's not good for you, it tastes bad. The chemical composition of the mushroom became associated with death, aka bad. \n\nThe opposite holds true for things that are healthy for you. Bee honey is a great energy source and always bacteria free (when it isn't mixed in with water or other liquids), so it tastes good to us.\n\nBut how do we taste? Think back to chemical compositions of certain foods. Chemicals that are capable of binding to the taste receptors on the tongue bind and send signals to the brain. That food then is given a \"taste\". Later health consequences of that food are taken into account by suggestion (I'll explain this in a bit), and the body determines the taste of that food as good or bad. \n\nNow, suggestion is the same thing as the mushroom example, but it's not *always* clear cut. If you eat something and it makes you sick everytime you eat it, the brain will associate the taste of that food as repulsive. But, let's say you eat something that's bad for you and then have the best sex of your life. You might get a headache from eating the food, but if you have mind blowing sex everytime right afterwards, your body will actually find that food good (not in all cases, but you get the idea). \n\nThere are also some foods that are incapable of binding to the tongue, even if they're bad for you, so you never associate that taste as bad. And even then, some foods might taste bad, but they kill you so quickly, you and your later generations never find the taste of that food bad until certain mutations or a stroke of luck let a few people survive their encounter with that food. \n\nThis little bit is also interesting. People can *force* themselves to hate unhealthy food by associating certain foods with bad thoughts, feelings, or effects. You can even try this yourself. If you're unhealthy or just curious, you can take a bar of chocolate, and, before eating it, think of the most depressing moment in your life. That might be a bit dark, but you can also look at a picture of something disgusting whilst eating the chocolate. Your brain will end up associating the chocolate with something horrible, even though the chocolate itself might not be, and \"give\" the chocolate a repulsive taste (just like the mushroom example). This could take a while, but it does definitely work. "},
{"title":"ELI5: How do guitar pickups, microphones, amplifiers, and the like work?","answer":"All sound is a series of air pressure changes. All any music technology is electronically or digitally capturing these changes. In an analogue circuit, the wave is captured as an alternating current, with changes in air-pressure becoming changes in voltage. In digital systems, the computer makes a digital list of different voltages and reads them out one at a time. When those voltages are applied to the speaker, it wobbles just right to create the exact right air-pressure changes to hear the sound."},
{"title":"ELI5: how does Adderrol work?","answer":"Your brain is made up of a whole bunch of different parts, all working together. \n\nOne of these parts sorts the important things to think about from the rest, so you can concentrate on what you're doing, instead of getting distracted by every single thing you see. \n\nSome people have a condition called ADHD, where this part works too slowly and gets tired easily, and can't keep up with all the unimportant sights, sounds and thoughts that it's meant to be filtering out. \n\nBecause of this, ADHD people *are* constantly distracted by silly little things that don't matter, because they can't help thinking about them instead, and forgetting what they were doing before. It also means they get bored super-quickly if they have to sit and do just one thing. \n\nNow, Adderal, Ritalin and a bunch of other medicines given to ADHD people are called *stimulants* - they make the brain go faster and have more energy. \n\nIf you give ADHD people just a little bit of these stimulants, it lets that slow, tired part of their brain get faster and more energetic, so it can keep up with all the stuff it sees and thinks about, and properly sort out the useful thoughts from all the other passing junk.\n"},

Can someone explain the possible effects, and what could happen by raising taxes, as well?","answer":"Starting in World War 2, America had very high taxes on the rich, and reasonably low taxes on everyone else.\n\nFor decades, things went fine with that setup. Rich people complained that taxes were too high, but nobody listened much.\n\nThen in the 1970s, taxes on ordinary people went up (it had to do with something called bracket creep--never mind what it is).\n\nNow rich people's claims that taxes were too high found an audience, Because taxes really were too high. Ronald Reagan promised to cut taxes, so people elected him.\n\nReagan cut taxes sharply, *but only for the rich.* In fact, he *increased* taxes for everyone else.\n\nEver since, Republicans have promised lower taxes, people have listened because their taxes really are too high, and then Republicans have cut taxes in ways that went entirely, or almost entirely, to the rich. \n\nIn fact, it's pretty clear now that Republicans *don't want* to cut taxes on ordinary people; after all, someone has to pay for all of the federal subsidies, military contracts, and bailouts that are the reason that many rich people are rich in the first place.\n\nAlso, these tax cuts were supposed to bring great, widespread prosperity. They haven't. If rich people really were job creators, we would be awash in jobs right now. We aren't. \n\nSo the effects of lowering and/or raising taxes depends on who you're lowering and raising them on. Ordinary people really should get more tax relief--they would spend the extra money, creating jobs and prosperity. They would probably spend the money more efficiently than government can. But rich people should pay more taxes--cutting their taxes hasn't worked. And rich people buy stupid things with their money--government can be more efficient with money than rich people, for the obvious reason that you buy everything you really want with your first million dollars. By your hundredth million, you're just wasting the money on an eighth house or a private jet or a giant yacht that isn't even fun to sail on."},

New York might face the problem more acutely because space is so tight to begin with.\n\nThe Good:\n\n* Usually safer - the people doing the gentrifying tend to be able to get more positive police presence to actively drive out criminal elements.  They also push for things like community benefits areas which effectively tax local businesses to pay for supplemental services like extra trash cans and litter removal.\n\n* Generally \"nicer\" - wealthier people like nice things, so they encourage better stores, nicer storefronts, etc.\n\n* Citywide tax benefits (maybe) - the nicer areas encourage wealthier people to move to the city, either from other cities or from the suburbs.  These wealthier people pay more in city income taxes and pay more sales taxes.  The increased property value also increases city property taxes.\n\n* Cheaper housing - gentrifying neighborhoods are cheaper than established neighborhoods, allowing people who possibly couldn't afford a decent place in the city to move in.\n\n* Cultural mingling - the newer people coming in (usually wealthier and whiter than the current residents) get to interact with the current residents.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n* It gets expensive - current (poorer) residents face higher rent and higher prices in local stores.  This usually leads to the displacement of current residents because they get prices out of their own neighborhood.\n\n* Destroying social fabric - a gentrifying neighborhood supports different types of cultural institutions than the original neighborhood did.  You can see this with a huge spate of black churches shutting down in Harlem because of financial reasons - the white people moving in don't go to black churches.\n\n* Cultural animosity - the flip side of the last good point.  Often the current residents feel threatened by the incoming residents, and the incoming residents often don't do a great job at outreach.  This leads to conflict and bitterness.\n\n* Too squeaky clean - a lot of establishments that \"make\" a neighborhood cool in the first place don't fit well with the newer and richer residents.  Bars and clubs get kicked out, gritty little ethnic food shops get replaced by national chains, the annual whatever-the-heck street festival gets cancelled because it's too rowdy.\n\n* Obnoxious hipsters - self-explanatory"},

For example, if a college student decides not to go to his philosophy class because he is hung over, Hegel would say that despite the student choosing to stay in bed, his choice is not truly a free choice (or he is not truly free) because he is failing to fulfill the purpose of his present time/being/duty/responsibility, aka being a college student, going to class, and learning something useful that is meant to apply to the world and better your mind for your life purpose/ultimate destiny/true freedom.

{"title":"ELI5: Currency ","question_detail":"As far as I know you can no longer exchange money for gold nor is currency made of gold anymore and hasn't been that way for a long time.(At least in the United States). How does this system work? It seems like it would collapse because it isn't backed by anything worth value.","answer":"Before there was currency, things were tricky. Say I grew potatoes and wanted a shirt. I could try trading potatoes for a shirt, but what if the shirt maker doesn't want potatoes but rice? Well then I have to find a rice grower who wants potatoes so I can get rice to trade for a shirt. It's a terrible way to do trading because it relies on the *\"coincidences of like needs\"* where person A has something person B wants and person B has something person A wants.\n\nSo early on people started using metals and other things as kind of a lowest common denominator. That way I can sell my potatoes for gold/silver/copper/salt whatever and use that currency to buy a shirt. \n\nBut this had a few problems, if you set a specific value to a physical good like gold, then you kind of paint yourself into a corner if the market changes. Say $1= 1/32 oz of gold, what happens if someone finds a massive deposit of gold somewhere in Colorado? Gold is suddenly not worth as much and therefor the value of a dollar changes even though almost nothing else about the economy changed.\n\n*What if the economy keeps growing but we never find more gold?*\n\nThen the value of a dollar changes drastically which effects the whole economy even though it's only the mining businesses that should be affected by a lack of gold. It would create deflation which is horrible to an economy.\n\nThe other thing that doesn't work is *credit*. Banks give credit and loans with the assumption that they will be paid back over time, but they create more dollars worth of credit than they have dollars worth of gold. They are \"creating\" money by using the value of time. If you need $40,000 for equipment to start a business that will make at least $55,000 in ten years, the bank can give you a loan for $40,000 and essentially create that new money as an advance on future payments.\n\nThat kind of banking is a big reason why the West grew so much quicker in the last few centuries than anyone else, only that kind of banking could have allowed the kinds of investments needed for the industrial revolution to have happened. \n\n*But then where does that leave gold? If new money is being created faster than gold is being extracted from the ground what does that mean?*\n\nIt means money can't be tied to anything physical, because it is far to inflexible for a modern economy. Credit used to lock up every couple of years in \"panics\" during the 18^th and 19^th centuries. By removing money from anything physical, it can be governed based on the needs of the whole economy and not just the availability of a finite resource.\n\n*So, you might ask, if money isn't backed up by anything physical, what value does it have?*\n\n**Money only has the value we all agree it has.** When I walk into a store and give the clerk a piece of paper with a $20 on it, we all agree that means I can take with me $20 worth of goods from that store. What that $20 buys changes slightly over time, but the change in value is controlled, slow, and unrelated to how much shiny things we find in the ground.\n\nA big part of what makes money stable is how stable the government is with money. The US has never missed a single payment on any debt since before we were officially a country, a 230+year perfect credit history. And considering we are ~20% of the world's economy, the government doesn't print too much money and has a perfect credit history, everyone assumes a US dollar will continue to have value. But if a country misses payments, people start to not trust the currency. If the government prints too much new money the currency wouldn't have value because there is more of it than there is demand for it. That's why a Zimbabwe one hundred trillion dollar bill for a couple of US dollars.\n\n**TL;DR** Currency is needed to be a lowest common denominator in trades. It used to be based off of goods like gold but that became very ridged and slowed down economic growth. Now the value of a currency is set independent of anything physical by a combination of the free market (how much do private people and businesses trust the money) and a government's central bank (how much money is being printed).

{"title":"ELI5: How misted water and sunlight make a rainbow?","question_detail":"Always been especially fascinated by how the sunlight is hitting the individual droplets and the light is being bent in each one individually, but the size of the rainbow from red to violet can be HUGE...","answer":"White light is actually composed of all the colors of the rainbow--  work with a prism (something that 'refracts' light) will show you how the light breaks up as it is bent.  [Picture](http://apollo.lsc.vsc.edu/classes/met130/notes/chapter19/graphics/prism.jpg)  \nMany people did not know what to make of this phenomenon, until Newton showed that the light could be returned to white by using a convex lens.  [Picture](http://www.physicssource.ca/images/newton_prism_01.jpg)   \n  \nNow, understanding that light can be refracted is the first step towards understanding how a rainbow forms.  Water can retract light in the same manor as a prism does. \n  \nEach falling droplet of water is acting as a prism and bending the light.  Based on your viewing angle, only certain bands of light will be visible-- this is because the different bands of light travel at slightly different speeds as the light is bent.  The slower it travels, the more sharply it is bent.  \n\nThe raindrop at the top (red band) of the rainbow is at the angle where the light is bent so that you only see red light coming from it. \nThat drop falls (obviously), and as it does the angle between you and the sun changes as well--  as it falls it will appear each color of the rainbow while passing through the appropriate angle.  \nDon't worry though, thousands of other drops are falling next to it which enables you to see the band of light.  Thousands more drops fall after it, which means you get to see all the colors at once.  \n  \nI'm not very artistic, but perhaps some one could draw an image to make this more understandable. "},

When you are writing a stream of data two a RAID 0 config, the stream will alternate every on every bit which drive to write on. Thus you get two times the write speeds becasue your writing twice at once. this is the same for the read speeds. The problem with this is because all the data are slip evenly between the two, if one drive failes you lose All your data. \n\n\n\nRaid 1 (again only using 2 drives).\nRaid takes two drives and make it look like one. The second drive in your system mirrors the first drive. its good becasue if one drive failes, you lose nothing\n\nRaid 5 (Requiers at least 3 drives) \nRaid 5 is like a combination of Radio 0 and 1. you combine at lease 3 drives and get 70% ish of the total strage. the remaining 30% is a sort of a back up that is spread over the three drives. If one drives dies, the other two can rebuild it and nothing bad happends. so you get some speed boost and redudancy \n\n\nRaid 6\nSame as raid 5, but requiers 4 drives min, and you can lose up two 2 drives and everything will be alright. \n\nRaid 10 (or 0+1) \nyou take two identical Raid 0 configs. so lets say you have 4 drives, you make 2, 2 drive raid 0 configs. then on your system i looks like you have 2 single drives. then with with your two raid 0 configs, you put them in raid 1.

{"title":"ELI5: Why are Chinese workers so mistreated when they live in the largest communist nation in the world? How does Chinese communism differ from Marxist theory?","question_detail":"How much does Chinese communism stray from Marxism? How does this affect Chinese workers?","answer":"Marx intended his model to work in a highly industrialized society, where the proletariat were industrial workers who had lost control of their livelihoods to those who owned \"the means of production.\" China never fit this model--they were, and in many ways still are, an agrarian society. This was especially the case back in the 30s and 40s where landlords controlled the livelihoods of their many farm tenants. This system had existed for centuries. Mao Zedong warped Marxist ideology in order to fit the agrarian landlord model. One of the first things the CCP (the Chinese Communist Party) did when they came to power was encourage the overthrowing and execution of the landlord class, eventually turning the land into collectives and communes. The failure of the communes in great part led to the disastrous Great Leap Forward in the 50s, but that's another story. \n\nSome today, looking back, believe the communist model failed so miserably in China because they encouraged revolution far too early in China's modernization/industrialization timeline. That is, the revolution came out of order. Theoretically, Marxism works if you have the industrial base to support it. China wasn't even close to that in the 1930s and 40s. \nEDIT: Remember your words."},
{"title":"[ELI5] Torque as it applies to cars and their performance","question_detail":"what is torque? \n\nwhat is \"peak torque\"?\n\nwhat does it mean to everyday driving?\n\nwhat does it mean to performance driving?\n\nwhat is \"a lot of torque\" (like 400 horsepower is considered a lot how much torque is a lot)?\n\n","answer":"Imagine you have to turn a big wheel around. For an easy example, let's say a grinding stone in an old-school flour mill. To turn it, you shove a stick into the axle and push along the stick to make it turn.\nTorque is the amount of force you push on that stick times the length of that stick.\n\nIf you have a 1-foot long stick and pushed it at 10 lbs. of force, you have 10 ft.-lbs. of torque. If you had a 10-foot long stick and pushed it at 1 lb. of force, it's the same amount of torque.\n\nNow to cars: Cars produce torque by expanding the exploding (or really quickly burning) gas to turn the crankshaft. It's exactly the same as your stick situation, except the stick is really short (say an inch or so) and you're pushing several thousand pounds of force upon it.\nBecause gasoline burns really quickly, you only get a very short burst of torque (but it's a LOT of torque). So you put together 4, 6, or 8 of those together so you have more \"pushes\" per revolution of your crankshaft. More cylinders, more torque.\n\nNow let's think about the relationship between torque and power:\nEach little detonation of fuel and air per cylinder provides force and the expansion of that gas provides energy. If each detonation gives 1kJ of energy, and you have 100 detonations per second, that's 100kJ per second: 100kW of power, or 134hp.\n\nNote, however, that you can only have so many detonations per revolution. So assuming each cylinder gives the same detonation, a 6-cylinder engine at 10,000 rpm gives the same power as a 12-cylinder engine running at 5,000 rpm. This is how F1 cars get 850hp out of a 1.6 liter engine.\n\nTo answer your questions directly:\n\nTorque = how hard your engine turns the driveshaft\n\nPeak Torque = the maximum torque your engine delivers (turbocharged engines have a very broad peak torque range, naturally-aspirated engines peak at a much higher rpm)\n\nEveryday driving: More torque means more passing on the highway\n\nPerformance driving: You want lots of power, which also means lots of torque. Turbocharged engines are better because they provide more torque (and thus power) at earlier rpms.\n\n\"a lot of torque\": For trucks, 500 ft-lbs is plenty. For FWD cars, 200 or more will get you where you need to go in a jiffy. For RWD cars, that's where it gets fun."},

They are also always pretty bad, bleeding for at least half an hour. Why is that?","answer":"The \"skin\" inside your nose has a lot of blood vessels in it, plus it is thinner than your other skin. Usually, snot keeps it moist and soft, but in the summer the heat can dry out your nose, making the skin more vulnerable to damage and bleeding. Often, this is due to conditions being \"dry\". Some people get more bleeds in the winter when the humidity is usually lower (depends on where you life). Also, if you have allergies to things in the summer like grad and pollen, it can inflame the surface in the nose and make it more likely to bleed. \n\nIt sounds like you should see a doctor. A bleed like that might mean you have a large blood vessel near the surface of the inside of your nose. Doctors can fix this problem by sealing off that vessel (my sister had this happen). "},

There seems to be a correlation between whole-integer spin particles and mass, but I'm not clear on whether the actual number itself represents anything other than a way to differentiate particles.","answer":"Spin is a number attached to any particle, representing a fundamental property of that particle. There isn't really any analogy with anything from the familiar world, so it is difficult to grasp intuitively. \n\nA particle with a half integer spin is known as fermion. Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which prevents two identical particles occupying the same quantum state, e.g, two indistinguishable electrons may not occupy the same energy level of an atom. However, if their spins are different then two otherwise identical electrons may share an energy level. \n\nExpanding on this, the angular momentum of a particle is defined by its orbital angular momentum and its spin, hence the quanta of energy needed to excite or de-excite an atom is linked to the spin of the electrons (or nucleons, since there are also energy levels observed inside the nucleus).\n\nThe magnetic properties of an atom are also dictated by the alignment of the electron's spin. \n\n\n"},
{"title":"Why are MRI machines so loud and differ in the noise made?","answer":"Hard to ELI5, but here goes....\n\nMRI works by causing the protons in your body to emit a radio signal. This signal is different depending on where in your body it originated. To embed this spatial information in the radio signal, the MRI needs to create a magnetic field that varies with position. To achieve this there are things called gradient coils surrounding the opening in  the MRI, electric current is passed through these coils and the nature of the current causes the coils to vibrate. It's these vibrating coils that cause the noise, and the noise will vary depending on the information that needs to be encoded at any specific time."},

If it's a debit card, then ten dollars is withdrawn from your checking account and put on hold for the merchant.

{"title":"ELI5: Collateralized Debt Obligations.","question_detail":"I watched the Khan Academy video on this and was left confused. What exactly is a collateralized debt obligation (is it a pool of debt)? How did defaults on mortgages affect them? How did CDO's help cause the 2008 financial crisis?","answer":"Imagine you own a small neighborhood bank, and you make loans to people in the community.  You have $1 million dollars in your bank to lend out.  Five people come in on monday, and each takes out a $200,000 mortgage for 20 years.  At first you think this is good for business. But then you realize that you don't have any more money to lend, and you won't be getting all of that money back for 20 years, so you aren't going to have anything to do for a long, long time.  Maybe, if you are lucky, in five or six years you will have been repaid enough to make one more mortgage, but you really don't like the idea of just sitting around that long.\n\nThen on Tuesday, a fancy Wall Street investment banker stops in town.  He comes by your office, and says he'll buy all those loans from you, so you can get the cash now instead of over the next twenty years. You think this is great, and you quickly agree.  He says thanks, and call him anytime you've got another loan to sell, and he'll get you a fair price.\n\nNow, imagine you are an investor who is close to retiring.  You want to earn a little bit of money, but you really, really don't want to blow all your savings, so you don't want any risky investments at all.  Along comes Mr. Wall Street banker once again, and he says: \"boy do I have just the thing for you! It's called a collateralized debt obligation! What I did was I bought up 10,000 different mortgages from all over the country, and I'm willing to let you in on the deal.  It's a really safe investment, because what are the chances all 10,000 of those homeowners are going to default on their loans?  But wait, because that's not even the best part!  I am going to give you first priority, so that if anyone defaults, I will take the loss on the first 1000 loans that go bad, just to keep you extra safe! And, even if more than 1000 people default, we can always repo the houses and sell them to get our money back. It's can't lose!\"\n\nAnd thus the CDO was born.  \n\n\nBasically, to form a CDO, you form a company and that company buys the rights to a bunch of different loans, so that it now has the right to collect the monthly payments on those loans.  The company writes a bunch of IOUs, called bonds, and gives them to people in exchange for the cash it needs to buy all these loans.  These bonds promise to pay people back, with interest, as the money from the loan payments comes in.  This particular kind of bond is called a CDO--collateralized debt obligation-- because it is an interest in a loan (a debt obligation) that has collateral (a house) to back it up.  \n\nHow these CDOs brought down the economy is complex, but the overly simple explanation is that everyone assumed that if you spread your investment over 1000's of loans, you would be safe because they wouldn't all go bad.  But, as it turned out, it's very possible for the entire housing market nationwide to fall at once, and when that happened, lots and lots of mortgages went into default, and the CDOs were nowhere near as safe an investment as everyone believed.

The only thing a computer natively understands are numbers.  Everything else is a convention.\n\nTake this post for example.  The computer doesn't know what words and letters are.  To the computer, this sentence is just a row of numbers, with each number representing one letter.\n\nLook at this webpage:  http://www.asciitable.com.  This shows a very common convention for mapping letters to numbers.  Let's take the simple word \"HELLO\" and translate it:\n\n    H    72\n    E    69\n    L    76\n    L    76\n    O    79\n\n\nWhen I typed in HELLO, the numbers 72,69,76,76,79 were transmitted to Reddit.  When you read this, Reddit send the same numbers to your computer.  Your computer looked up what letter each number corresponds to, and displayed the letters HELLO.\n\n\nPictures are the same way.  Each pixel in an image is encoded as a set of three numbers (R,G, and B).  Each number represents the amount of red, green, and blue to mix together to make the desired color.  Again, it's just a standard convention humans have decided on.  TO the computer, it is just a set of three numbers, nothing more.\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5 - Black holes","answer":"Here's a way to think about it.  If you throw something up in the air, it comes back down.  If you throw it faster, it takes longer.  If you were to throw it fast enough, it would never come back down and just keep going forever.  The slowest speed for which this happens is called the escape velocity of Earth.  It's about 10,000 m/s.  \n\nNow imagine that you were to take all the mass of Earth and compress it down so that the radius was about half as much.  The escape velocity would be higher.  The more you compressed the Earth, the higher the escape velocity at the surface would be.  \n\nAt some point, you compress it down so far that the escape velocity is equal to the speed of light.  At that point, nothing, not even light, can ever make it off the surface.  This size is known as the Schwarzchild radius.  \n\nEvery mass has a corresponding Schwarzchild radius.  In order to make a black hole, you just have to compress the radius of the object to smaller than the Schwarzchild radius.  \n\nEDIT: FYI, the Schwarzchild radius for Earth is about 9 mm.  "},

{"title":"How are hybrid species possible?","question_detail":"I thought the definition of species is \"can interbreed\". How, then, are Ligers and Tigons, Mules and Hinnies possible?","answer":"The concept of species is a good bit fuzzier than we generally think of it.    There are multiple definitions of species, \"can't breed\" (which really is more like \"doesn't produce viable offspring in the wild\") is only one of them.  That definition isn't particularly useful when trying to differentiate between fossil species, for example.  Lions are African and Tigers are Asian, so, for the most part, they don't commonly run in to each other in the wild (so they don't have an opportunity to interbreed).  Mules and Hinnies are both infertile, so they also don't count as viable offspring.\n\nIf you really want to mess up your concept of species look in to ring species.  What happens sometime is you get a species of insect, for example, living on the north side of a mountain.  Very slowly, over generations some of them will start to move to the east side of the mountain, and some will move to the west.  As this happens evolution will naturally cause the groups to slightly change over time to the point that you would consider some portion of them to be a subspecies.  So let's say you have subspecies north, subspecies northwest, subspecies northeast, southeast and southwest.  Well by the time SE and SW meet on the south side of the mountain they are different enough they could no longer interbreed.  This is true even though SW can breed with NW, SE can breed with NE, and both NE and NW can breed with N.  So how many species do you really have there now?"},
{"title":"ELI5: The tremendous U.S. national debt","question_detail":"How in the world the the United States manage to pile up this vast amount of a capital check? Is there any way that it can be payed off/returned to whomever it is owed to?","answer":"National debt is not the same as personal/commercial debt. In some respects, having at least *some* national debt is good for the economy, because the national debt exists as treasury bonds sold to the public and held as an investment or a hedge. If a country chooses not to pay its debt, there's no repo men coming to take its highways or cultural treasures. It loses the faith and credit of investors and will find it very difficult to borrow in the future. But countries have restructured or even erased their debts before.\n\nThe US national debt, according to usdebtclock.org, is about $15.8 trillion. The gross domestic product, or GDP, is a little under that, around $15.2 trillion. So debt to GDP is a little over 100%. If you want a personal analogy (although, like I said, it's misleading), that's like a guy making $100,000 a year having total personal debt of $100,000. Meh.\n\n[This graph](http://floodingupeconomics.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/us-gross-public-debt-as-a-percentage-of-gdp.png) is a graph of the ratio of debt to GDP over the past century or so. It's certainly higher now than it has been for a while, likely because of a combination of 1) the giant freakin' economic contraction (the Great Recession) in 2008; 2) declining tax revenues due to marginal-rate tax cuts; 3) increased spending over the past decade on the Iraqi and Afghan operations, plus homeland security spending; 4) increased spending in 2009 on a stimulus package; 5) increasing costs for entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security; 6) and some other stuff I'm not thinking of. But it's been higher before, shooting above 120% in the aftermath of World War II. The combination of decreased revenue from the Depression, increased spending on social programs and stimulus during the New Deal, and increased spending on the war (acc. to Wikipedia, the atom bomb project alone cost nearly $26 billion in 2012 dollars) led to a level of public debt that some naysayers said would never be paid back. It was paid within a matter of decades.\n\nThe public debt gives a nation and government flexibility to deal with crises and shortfalls. Although there's widespread agreement that national debts cannot be allowed to simply increase without bound (although a segment of economists, the New Monetarists, are more sanguine about pubic debt), large national debts can be sustained for some time when needed to bail a country out of trouble. The important thing is for the economy to grow. The fact is, $15 trillion sounds like a lot until you understand that the US economy is so huge that it amounts to about a year's worth of goods and services. (Greece's national debt is around 170% of their GDP, and they also lack flexibility in dealing with budget deficits because they don't control their own currency, the euro.)\n\nAs to *whom* the debt is owed, it is mostly *us*, as in Americans. [Wikipedia's article on the US public debt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_public_debt) notes that nearly $5 trillion is intragovernmental, owed to various government agencies like Social Security. Of the remaining amount, 53% is owed to American citizens. Forty-seven per cent is owed to foreign interests, mostly large central banks which have multiple interests in owning US treasury bonds."},
{"title":"ELI5 why water of 50Â°C in the shower feels hot to touch, but I can inhale smoke of a cigarette (which I'm guessing is even hotter).","answer":"Three reasons contribute to this.  \n\n1) Coefficient of Thermal Conductivity\n\nLike watabit said.  Water's is about 20 times as high as air's.  This means that at a given temperature, heat exchange happens about 20 times as quickly.\n\n2) Specific heat\n\nWater has a very high specific heat, about four times as high as for dry air.  This means that a given mass of air will release only about a quarter as much energy to drop by a degree as the equivalent mass of water would.\n\n3) Density\n\nWater is about 800 times as dense as air.  So, this means that the equivalent volume of water takes about 3200 times as much energy to drop it by one degree as the equivalent volume of air.  "},

Well, you can play in the plastic one that's bolted in on top of the monkey bars, but there are no slides or windows or other cool shit.  It's very hard for you to do anything that might result in the software breaking.  This means that if you want to change specific settings or how exactly the phone or an app works, you're out of luck.  There is only one way to do something, and that's the way Apple has rigorously tested and determined \"Nope, a user won't be able to break this.\"  IOS is good for people who are not tech savvy, don't care about customizability and just want something working out of the box.\n\nAndroid is like playing out in the woods.  You can do pretty much whatever you want, however you want.  You want to play in a tree fort?  Hell yes you do.  However, you have to build it yourself.  But you can build it exactly how you want, with windows, slides, and all the cool shit you want.  You can download this app that changes how your home screen acts, or that app that displays your contacts in a certain way.  However, there are very few safeguards.  Maybe you'll build a fort that you can fall out of if you lean the wrong way, or maybe your home screen app will conflict with your contacts app.  It's up to you to deal with those problems.  Thus, Android is for the more tech inclined who want loads of customization and can deal with troubleshooting and solving their own problems."},

{"title":"ELI5: The US System of Government","question_detail":"So you have a president, but he's not the leader of a political party and he can't nessessarily pass the laws he wants? What's the difference between the senate & congress? And then each state has it's own governor and senate?\n\nCould someone give me a run down of what all these pieces are and how they relate to each other? ","answer":"In most democracies, the person in charge of the legislature (the group of people who pass laws, like a Parliament or Congress) is also the \"head of government,\" meaning that person is in charge of the details of how laws get enforced.\n\nIn the US those two rolls are separate. The Congress can pass laws, but does not have the power to enforce them. The **President** must follow the laws Congress passes but is in charge or filling in the details about how it is enforced. All the bureaucracy and government agencies report to the President, not congress.\n\nNow **Congress** is made up of two parts, the **House of Representatives** (made up of 1 Congressman/ ~720,000 people) and the **Senate** (2 from each state no matter the state's population). For a law to \"pass\" both the House and the Senate must pass the exact same law with the exact same language. Each chamber does that a little differently but it can not be \"passed\" unless every word is the same between both sides.\n\nThen, because the US is based on common law not civil law, there is a **judicial branch** made up of judges that can change laws and policies. If someone gets arrested for a law they think is unconstitutional, they can bring the case to a judge and they decide either yes the law/government action goes against the constitution or no the law/action is within the power of government. The only time judges can stop laws is if it violates the constitution or if there are two laws that violate each other. They can not pass laws and the can not enforce them, but they can clarify which ones are constitutional. The Supreme Court is 9 people and it is the final word on what is and is not constitutional, there is no way to appeal a Supreme Court decision to another judge.\n\nThese three parts (the President, the Congress and the judiciary) are known as the **three branches of government**. They each have their own kind of power, but they are set up so that no one branch can overpower the other two and take complete control of the government. Each has at least one way of overpowering the other, and each has at least one way of being overpowered by another.\n\nFor example; after Congress passes a bill, the president must either sign it (when it instantly becomes law) or veto it (where none of it becomes law). So if congress passes something the president doesn't like he can veto it, but he must veto the whole bill (that's why small projects sometimes get bundled into more popular bills). But, if Congress *really* likes the bill, they can vote again and if they get 2/3 to vote yes the veto is removed and the bill is law. There are dozens of ways like this that the branches interact but the important thing is that it is designed so that the different branches stop any one from becoming an all powerful branch.\n\n**States also have these three branches** at the state level (except they call their equivalent of a \"President\" Governor), each independent and accountable to their state's constitution. There are some small differences but mostly they are based on the same model as the federal government. There are some things states can not do because only the national government can do it (raise an army, print money, and others). But there are some things that *only* states can do, things the federal constitution say is up to the states (education and others).\n\nSo that's basically it. **President, two-part congress, and judiciary**. One enforces laws but can't pass them, one writes laws but can't enforce them and the other judges if the actions being taken in writing and enforcing the laws is constitutional. States have the same basic system and power between states and the federal government is split up so that one can't dominate the other in everything."},

Or does only new spending only count if it was passed by congress after January 20th? Does automatic increases in spending on social programs count as \"expanding government\" or is it simply that a down economy means more people qualify for social assistance programs?\n\nThere is no objective answer like Amarkov said simply because there is no universal definition. If you don't count automatic increases, then yes Obama has grown government at the slowest rate since Eisenhower. If you count everything government does he has had more people on food stamps since the early days of the program. If you look at government nominally, it has grown very little. If you look at government as a percentage of GDP it has grown tremendously (same with the debt). \n\nAnd it's further complicated by the fact that Obama is not really \"in charge\" of the government spending, since Congress has more power in spending then he does. If Obama tried to do what Nixon did and withhold money he would be in violation of the constitution, he must spend every cent Congress tells him he must spend, it's not his choice. Does Obama get penalized for extending the Bush tax cuts without offsetting their cost or is that growth in debt Congress's fault?

{"title":"4th dimensional spacetime","question_detail":"I can't wrap my head around the idea that time it self can be variable","answer":"Oh, hey son. What. \"Spacetime\"? Where did you hear about that? Well that's a complicated one, so how about we start with something simple and work up to it?\n\nSo, take Ash and Misty from pokemon. Imagine that they're in a grass field, and standing next to each other. Now let's imagine there's a tree a few metres in front of Ash, which he's looking at. Let's also imagine there's a tree a few metres to the right of Ash, but this one Misty is looking at. So now they're facing different directions. If Ash walks forward to the tree he's looking at, what does that look like to Misty? Well it looks like he's gone left! But that's weird because Ash thinks he's gone forwards - you see son different people have different ways of looking at things.\n\nNow, this all happens because Ash and Misty live in \"3-D space\". No not \"outer space\", just the normal space that you and I live in, one where you can go back and forth, up and down, left and right. But you didn't want to hear about \"space\", you wanted \"spacetime\". Okay, it's similar and it was invented by a guy called Albert Einstein... Why yes he's the one with the big hair! This all happened because Einstein knew that things couldn't go faster than the speed of light so he made something called the \"theory of special relativity\". In this people don't live in \"space\", they live in \"spacetime\". In space we found that people saw things differently when they were facing in different directions. In spacetime things ALSO look different if people are moving at different speeds!\n\nHow do they look different? Alright, I'm getting there! Say Ash and Misty are in that field again but this time whilst Ash is standing still, Misty is going REALLY fast, like at maybe HALF of the speed of light... No she won't hit the tree because she's a really good runner. I know because I've spoken to her, but we'll talk about that another time. Now, the way that Ash and Misty see things differently is really weird and hard to think about - so hard that Einstein had to use Maths! So don't worry if this bends your mind a little! If at a certain time of day Ash claps his hands somewhere in the field, when Misty is going past him she will see him clapping his hands at a different point in the field at a different time! Yes I KNOW that it's crazy. It turns out that like in \"space\" where by turning around you can turn how far someone has gone forwards into how far they've gone leftwards, when you are in \"spacetime\" if you go really fast you can turn how far they've gone forwards into when they do something!\n\nWeird, huh?\n\n(P.S, speaking to adults now - I'll leave out a description of time dilation and length contraction. They're both logical followings from having your spacial coordinate *rotated* into your time coordinate as well, but that doesn't really help explain spacetime.)"},
{"title":"ELI5: How some people can be more than just XX or XY chromosome?","question_detail":"I've found that some people can be born with XXY, XXX, etc. How is this possible? \n\nAlso, out of pure curiosity: Does it occur in other organisms beside humans, and if so, which ones?\n\n","answer":"When sex cells multiply to create egss or sperm, the cells go through two separations (forming 4 cells) instead of just one like in normal cell replication. In every cell you have two chromosomes that code for the same things, think of them like fraternal twins: they're not exactly the same, but they do a lot of the same things. During the first separation, the chromosomes line up so that all the twins are next to each other, one closer to the right pole and one closer to the left pole. In normal replication, the twins are separated and one twin from each pair is pulled to each pole. So, in normal replication, you have the XY (using male for simplicity) twins lined up and the X goes right and the Y goes left. But assume these twins are really attached to each other and they hold hands really tightly. Then, if one pole attempted to pull the twins, they would get both of them. so you have an XY in one pole and nothing in the other pole. then the cells would completely split and you'd have two separate cells, one with an extra chromosome and one without a chromosome. \n\nNow the second replication would occur. The chromosomes, which in a normal cell have been separated, line up again so they can be split in half. Each half of a chromosome is called a chromatid. So you have one cell with too many, and they line up, but one of the chromosomes is actually a pair of chromosomes and when the other chromosomes get separated into their chromatids, this pair just gets separated from it's twin chromosome. In other words, the poles go to pull all the twins apart (one half of the twin one way and one half the other [haha macabre!]), but with the really close twins, instead of pulling them in half, the poles just pull one full twin (X) one way and one full twin (Y) the other way. The cells would then again separate fully and you'd have two more individual cells, although each one would have an extra half of a twin. \n\nNow back to the cell with too few chromosomes. the chromosomes in that one would line up, only there would be one twin just missing completely. Each pole would pull all the twins that are lined up in half, and separate into individual cells, but each one of these new cells would be less a half a twin.\n\nThere's another way that you could end up with extra Xs. Now lets assume that a cell has gone through the first replication like normal and the cells have split and there is an X in one cell and a Y in the other. Then the second replication occurs. For this replication, think about each of the individual chromosomes as a wishbone instead of a person. When you pull on each half of a wishbone, it's supposed to break and one person gets one half and the other person gets the other half. So for the second replication, all the cells line up in the center, and the poles try to pull the wishbones in half. But assume that the X is a super wishbone and when you pull on each half, it doesn't break in half. That means that when they poles try to pull it apart, one pole will get the full wishbone and one pole will get no wishbone, then the cells will separate again, and one will be missing a half of a wishbone and the other will have an excess half of a wishbone.

{"title":"ELI5: The substitution rule in Calculus","question_detail":"I'm taking Calculus II over the summer and we did the Substitution rule last week, but for the life of me I can't understand it. I get that you just replace some part of the difficult equation with 'u', but I don't understand at all how to decide which part to pick and what you're even supposed to do with 'u' once you decide what it is.\n\nThis is really killing me, can anyone put this in simple terms for me while still explaining the steps or something, I get the concept but that is just too abstract.","answer":"**For integration:**\n\nFirst off, let's take a function, say **y = (3x - 1)^2** \nIf I ask you to integrate this, it's hard. It doesn't follow any basic rules.  \nSo you're stuck with **Y = int[ (3x - 1)^2 dx ]**\n\nThis is where substitution comes into play.\n\nYou can replace anything in that equation with variables and mess around with that. The goal is to make your equation fit a basic pattern. In this case, I want to get something that looks  \n**like Y = int [ x^2 dx ]**\n\nSo, to start off I'll make a **new variable, \"u\".** Now, I want it to look  \n**like Y = int [ u^2 du ]**\n\nThe reason I chose this pattern is because it's really close to what we had, and experience tells me this is probably it. It's a game of finding patterns.\n\nAnyway, I need to make my initial equation look like this.  \n**Well, u = 3x - 1 would make this into Y = int[ u^2 dx ]**  \nThis is really close. I need a \"du\" in there to make this work. The way to do this is to derive u in order to get du/dx. If I can get a du/dx in there I can multiple away the dx on top and on bottom.\n\n**So, deriving u, I get du/dx = 3**\n\nSo now I have Y = int[ u^2 dx]. What I can do is multiple by 3/3 (or think of it as multiplying by 1/3 and 3/1). Watch:  \nY = (1/3) int[ u^2 dx (3) ]  \n3 = du/dx  \nY = (1/3) int[ u^2 dx (du/dx) ]\nY = (1/3) int[ u^2 du]\n\nTa daa!\n\nNow that's easy to integrate. The pattern for int[ x^n dx] is really simple, and it works whether you have an x or a different letter. Once your done, you can just replace any leftover u's with 3x -1 (since they are equal after all.)\n\n____\n\nSometimes you need a variable to make your du/dx though. For example, what if the equation was \"**y = (x^2 - 1)^2 * 2x**\"?\n\nWell, the answer is to just look for patterns. This is similar to the last one - you can see something close to u^2 du. \n\nWhat you do for this one is say **u = x^2 - 1**  \nthen, deriving you get **du/dx = 2x**\n\nReplacing the original equation, you get **y = u^2 * du/dx**. Integrating this you get **Y = int[u^2 * dx * du/dx] = int[ u^2 du]**    \n\n____\n\nIf you look at this, it's all following a similar pattern. **You're looking for some function you can integrate** (like u^2, or 3u, or 2u^3 + 10u^2 + 3u) **multiplied by its derivative** (2u, 3, 6u^2 + 20u + 3). That lets you sub in u and du/dx, giving you a nice \"int[ u-function du]\" that's much easier to solve.\n\n____\n\n**Derivative explanation will be in comments**"},

Now, you have costs that vary by how much you produce, but you also have costs you have to spend anyway. Whether you sell 10 glasses or 1000 glasses, you still had to buy a pitcher and a stand.

{"title":"What's the deal with autism?","question_detail":"So I see a lot of Awareness about autism. What is it exactly? What are the dangers of it? It seems like it is some form up mental retardation. Why is it happening so often? Is it just an increase in diagnosis? I know a kid who is autistic and he's fully functioning but he's just a little wired. ","answer":"I donât have sources, or time to collect them, so you can take this for what its worth...  I have heard at a lecture by Jan Van Dijk, a respected clinical psycologist from the Netherlands, that Autism is related to what are called 'mirror Neurons.'  These Neurons are what allow a person to emulate the behaviour of others around them.  Individuals who have Autism have been found to have less of these Neurons, however there may be more to it that I are not aware of.\n\nAs far as the cognitive abilities of individuals who have Autism I would really recommend watching the movie called \"wretches and jabberers\"**(please excuse the sarcastic title created by the film makers who have autism themselves, it's a very respectful movie)**   http://www.wretchesandjabberers.org/press.php  The movie is about two guys with Autism that travel around the world in search of people like themselves who have autism but have learnt to type as a form of communication.  Despite **appearing** to have significant intellectual and behavioural disabilities and no verbal capabilities, the men demonstrate that they can type their thoughts on a computer with no problem and are actually very well spoken intiligent people.  Not all people who have Autism learn to type but my guess is that most (if not all) understand much more than we realize and juts have trouble showing it.  \n\nAutism appears to be on a scale raining from sever Autism to Aspergers syndrome which can be hard to even recognize in it's lightest forms. \n\n\nI think the main thing to remember is that although people with Autism may appear to avoid social contact, they do not necessarily want to be isolated either.  I have found when approaching someone who has sever Autism rather than trying to get them to engage in what you think of as normal behaviour, instead take an interest in something you have seen they like to do.  Carefully and respectfully join in on something they seem to enjoy while trying not to overwhelm them.  This is the best way for them to enjoy your interaction because they are already comfortable with the activity and do not need to mirror your behaviour to share the experience with you.  An example of this was a young person who had Autism that I was working with, she really liked playing with gloves, so we I played with them too, made voices as though they were puppets, helped her to glue eyes onto them and she had a great time and even made eye contact.  I was told she almost never does this.  It is worth taking the time to really meet someone with sever Autism, there is something amazing about breaking through that barrier and realizing that there is a really interesting person on the other side that just wants to be understood.\n\nAs for the increase in diagnoses, As of the last time I looked into it (some time ago) I don't think it's really known what causes Autism so coming up with why it appears to be more frequent is likely not known.  \n"},

{"title":"ELI5: Why whole wheat bread is better for you than white despite having more calories?","question_detail":"I've been wondering about this for a while. White bread has less calories and carbs, but I've always been told wheat is better. Pls help","answer":"Calories are not bad for you, neither are carbs. They are fuel for your body. However your body needs more than just \"energy\" to lead a healthy life.\n\nThe problem with white bread is that it is generally considered a source of \"empty calories\", that is, an energy source that does not carry other nutrients. Look at the nutritional information on the side of whole wheat bread- yes, there are more calories but there is also more protein and vitamins. Some breads are rich in omega-3 fatty acids which aid in brain function  and whole wheat bread is generally a good source of fibre which keeps you regular and promotes heart health.\n\nAnyways, if you consume less calories than you expend, you will lose weight. And part of doing that could involve consuming white bread instead of brown bread. But there is more to health than what's on the scale. You could technically lose weight if you reduce your daily caloric intake and consume only doritos and twinkies but that is obviously not recommended.\n\n"},
{"title":"ELI5 how FTP works","question_detail":"I was asked to submit a video to a contest via FTP, but I had no idea what it was or how it worked. Could someone please explain?","answer":"FTP is 'file transport protocol', and is a way for two computers to transfer a file between them. One computer is called the client, and one is the server. The client is the machine that wishes to either send or receive a file to/from the server, and will attempt to connect to the server. When connecting, the server will usually ask for a username and password (much akin to having a lock on your door, as most people do not want strangers being able to walk through the door), and assuming this is correct, the server will allow the client to connect.\n\nNext, the client will will ask the server to either send him a file, or accept a file from him. Now the file will start transferring between the two over the internet (just like letters being mailed between two houses, except thousands of letters being sent every second). Once the transfer is complete, the client will thank the server for a job well done, and close the connection.\n\nTo actually use FTP, on Windows, you will need an FTP program. One I would recommend is FileZilla ( http://filezilla-project.org/download.php/ ). Once downloaded, open it up, enter the server name, your username and password, and the port (usually 22), and click connect.

The researchers, however, had mixed up the prices.  Then they took the prices away completely and did a blind taste-test.  In the latter scenario, the more expensive wines were generally less well-received than the cheap ones.  I couldn't find the exact study, but I did find [this](http://www.marketplace.org/topics/life/freakonomics-radio/freakonomics-do-wine-experts-or-prices-matter) and [this](http://blog.wblakegray.com/2010/11/why-more-expensive-wines-taste-better.html).

{"title":"ELI5: Screen Resolution, Megapixels, HD, HDMI/VGA, (aspect ratio?) all this!","question_detail":"I have no idea how any of this shit is related or if it is related, could i get some context on what any of this means.\n\nEdit: spellling.","answer":"All digital images, including videos, are made up of an enormous grid of tiny coloured squares called pixels. Zoom far enough into any image and you'll start seeing them. Resolution refers to how many of these pixels are, and is so named because the more pixels there are making up an image, the more detail there is to *resolve*. It's like mosaic artwork -- you can make a really abstract representation of someone out of 200 tiles, but you'll need thousands and thousands to make a recognisable portrait.\n\n[I made this animated GIF to better explain how resolution impacts detail.](http://i.imgur.com/WzJgr.gif) You can see that the version with only 2709 pixels is basically unrecognisable, and that the more pixels are added, the more detail you can see. The numbers denote the resolution, which is commonly written Width-x-Height -- 500x200 means the image is a grid 500 pixels wide and 200 pixels high, making it 100,000 pixels total.\n\n*HD* stands for *high definition*, and is a non-technical term denoting any video signal with more than 1280x720 resolution. This is what's used for most HDTV, and it's around three times the detail of DVDs and non-HD television. You'll also see the term *full HD* or *1080p*, which means 1920x1080 or 2.1 million pixels. This is what's used on Blu-rays and some internet streams, and it's twice HDTV, or six times regular TV/DVD.\n\nA *megapixel* is one million pixels. If a camera says it's 32 megapixels, that means it can create images that each contain up to around 32,000,000 pixels. They use this term, rather than X-Y measurements like \"500x200\", because they can capture images in a variety of aspect ratios.\n\nVery commonly-used resolutions are often labelled according to their height. Examples are 720x480 (480p/i, or standard definition TV/DVD in USA and Japan), 720x576 (576p/i, standard definition TV/DVD in Australia and Europe), 1280x720 (720p, HDTV), 1920x1080 (1920p/i, some HDTV or Bluray), or 2K, 4K, 6K and 8K (used in digital cinema/high-end cameras).\n\nWhen you pick a resolution on Youtube and see 360, 480, 720, etc, that's what those numbers mean.\n\nThe *aspect ratio* refers to the shape of the frame. You've noticed that new \"widescreen\" TVs are a different shape than the old TVs -- that's a change in aspect ratio, from square to wider. When you watch an old TV show and it has black bars on the left and right of your TV, or you watch a new movie and it has black bars on the top and bottom, that's because the TV show or movie was filmed in a different aspect ratio to your television set.\n\nTelevision sets usually note their aspect ratio as either *4:3* -- meaning that for every 4 centimetres of width they have, they have 3 of height -- or *16:9*. Old square-ish TVs are 4:3, new widescreens are 16:9. Media, however, always denotes its aspect ratio according to :1. 2:1 media would be an image exactly twice as wide as it is high.\n\n[Here's an image I made demonstrating the different aspect ratios in common use.](http://i.imgur.com/xuPvU.png)\n\nWhen the aspect ratio of what you're watching doesn't match the aspect ratio of your television set, you're either left with unused space on your screen (because a square doesn't completely fill a rectangular hole) or you zoom in on the image to cut off the edges (called 'pan and scan').\n\nHDMI and VGA refer to the way signals are encoded to pass from your computer, DVD/Bluray player, Play Station, etc to your TV set, and the cables designed for those signals. They all operate in different ways. VGA is the old-timey analogue signal; the chips on your computer decode your video into signals about how red, green, and blue (the colours that make up all other colours) different parts of your image are, feeds them through a VGA cable to your monitor, and says \"Here, display this.\" HDMI, or High Definition Media Interface, actually just transmits the raw video *and audio* data from your player to your TV, so your TV/monitor can turn it into image information itself. HDMI supports transmitting much more data, which is necessary for HD signals, and will do a much better job than VGA will.\n\nThe other two important details to note in a video are framerate and scanning type. All videos are just made up of lots of still images played back very quickly; each image is a *frame*. A movie is usually 24 frames per second, while TV is 25 or 30 depending on where you are. There are two types of ways to display these frames. The first is in *progressive scan*: you show all of frame 1, then all of frame 2, then all of frame 3. This is how computers and movie projectors work, and how a modern TV setup with a Bluray player and a HDMI cable will work. But the second option is to *interlace* it. This is where you break the image up into rows [like this](http://gagadget.com/files/u1/2010/02/interlace.png). You show the odd rows of frame 1, then the even rows of frame 1, then the odd rows of frame 2, and so on, alternating very quickly, never updating the entire picture at once. This is how old non-LCD/plasma televisions worked, how videotapes work, and how composite cables -- the yellow cable you used to plug in your Nintendo 64 back in the olden days -- work. \n\nYou'll sometimes see videos described as *1080i60* or *720p24*, especially on camera menus. The first number is the height of the resolution. The *p* or *i* refers to *progressive* or *interlaced* mode, and the last number refers to the framerate. So when you see 720p24, you know that it's going to capture a 1280x720 image, it's going to capture the entire image in one go as opposed to dividing it up into sets of rows, and it's going to do it 24 times per second."},
{"title":"ELI5: The pros and cons of small government vs big government","question_detail":"I dont have a firm grasp of finance or economics, or how the influence of government (large or small) affects me ","answer":"When people talk about \"big government\" they mean how powerful the government is and how many things it is in charge of.  Big governments can do a lot of great things, like build roads, create space programs, hire plenty of police and firefighters to protect us, and pay for our medicine when we get sick.  They can also watch over other people to make sure they aren't doing things like dumping bad chemicals into the rivers or forcing people to work without paying them.\n\nOne downside of big government is that all of these things cost money, and the government gets almost all of its money through taxes.  That means that you will have to pay more taxes, so you'll have less money to spend on things that you want.  Another downside is that the people that are supposed to be protecting us from bad guys can sometimes be bad guys themselves, and they can abuse this extra government power to help out themselves and their friends and keep other people locked up.\n\nWith small government, they try to stay out of the way and let people handle things for themselves.  The good side of this is that it costs a lot less, so you don't have to pay as much in taxes.  Also since the government doesn't control as much, those roles are taken on by other people and businesses, which can create more competition.  This means that if you don't like the laws in one city you can move to another, or if you don't like that a company is doing bad things you can buy from another company.\n\nThe downside to this is that there aren't always choices like that.  Sometimes companies become so big that even if they're doing bad things you can't choose to buy from another company because there aren't any.  Also it isn't always easy to simply move from one city to another if you don't like things, because moving can be expensive and finding a job can be tough.  Lastly, when you don't have as many rules from the big government, smaller governments and companies can make rules that are unfair and discriminate against others.\n\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to both.  You generally want the government to be big enough that it can help with the most basic needs of its citizens, and oversee the companies within its borders to make sure they're not taking advantage of their workers or customers.  At the same time you want it small enough so that it doesn't take over everything so there is some competition and people have choices."},
{"title":"ELI5: How does one secure venture capital funding?","question_detail":"I don't have an idea or plans to do so, I'm just wondering how this process takes place normally. The information I found online seems to be hype.","answer":"You put together a convincing case, and go ask for it.  But you'd better know your shit, and have done your homework.\n\nThe trick is not just in building a convincing case, but identifying a viable business to base all this on.  You have some idea, and you put together a plan for developing your idea.  You identify who your customers might be, and how you will go about getting their money.  You project things forward a bit, and anticipate assorted costs and difficulties, and upsides.  You anticipate growth.\n\nBut let's turn it around.  The venture capitalist is a gambler, evaluating your proposal, and trying to find flaws and so on.  They aren't going to just write you a check, they will need convincing first, then there will need to be a series of constraints and evaluations along the way.  They may only need to have a hit once in every ten investments, but they are still very careful about giving away money."},
{"title":"ELI5 These mysterious ratings that make or break the production of a TV Show.","question_detail":"There has been many a time when a show I enjoyed didn't have a season due to \"ratings\". ","answer":"Ratings: The *estimate* of the amount of people who are watching a particular program.  Each rating \"point\" represents about 1.1 million people. A 1.0 rating means about 1.1 million people. A 3.0 rating means about 3.3 million.\n\nThese are calculated by a company called Nielson, a rather small amount of specific households are selected as \"Nielson families\" and their TV watching habits are monitored by a special set top box they are given.  This is supposed to be a reflection of the nation as a whole, so all of the Nielson families together can give a good estimate of about how many people all together are watching a certain show.\n\nWhy they matter: TV shows are there to make money.  They do this by attracting advertisers.  The more people who watch your show, the more people who see the ads.  If a show cannot get viewers, no one wants to advertise on it since no one will see their ads.  If the show can't get advertisers, its not making money, and you (the network) should replace it with one that does.\n\nDepending on what channel the show is on, the time it is broadcast, and the cost to make the show factor in this.  A prime time show on say NBC at 8pm on Thursdays is a time where a lot of people watch TV, and it is on a major network. They expect very good ratings, like say between 3 to 6. If you get 2 that's bad, if you're getting 6 that's awesome.\n\nIf you are on a lowly cable channel, much less is expected. A 1 - 2 rating would be acceptable. A 3 or 4 would be crazy awesome, A 0.3 would suck and you're getting canned.\n\nPlease note though, there is much debate on how accurate these ratings truly are, however this is generally ignored by all parties involved and they accept the ratings as fact.\n"},

The only time I noticed is when it would take me a couple of hours to download a new patch, while my guildies would talk about having it done in a few minutes.\n\nMy question is this: does download / upload speed have a noticeable affect on the experience of online gaming?  And is it true that for competitive online gaming - player-vs-player - you get a distinct advantage if you have a fast connection?","answer":"The download speed doesn't affect your gaming experience unless it's abysmally slow. Usually you don't need more than half an Mbps.\n\nWhat really affects your gaming experience is the time it takes for data to make a *round trip*. This is called your latency or ping.\n\nSo if your ping is 200 ms (ping/latency is always in milliseconds), it takes a 100 ms to reach the server and then another 100 ms to come back to your computer.\n\n100 ms is playable, but you should always aim for &lt; 50 ms.\n\nHowever, there is a catch. Though your download speed doesn't really affect the quality, higher quality lines (which thus allow higher speeds) do benefit your ping.\n\nDo keep in mind that if you are using the copper telephone network (ADSL, ADSL2+ and, in particular, VDSL{2}) having your connection set to the maximum speed might cause some extra errors in the data, this means that data has to be resend, increasing the time a round trip takes.\n\n\n\nOf course, this is pretty much what mcowger said, with the ping/latency is a round trip correction and some extra technical info"},

Yes, but only for simple, obvious vulnerabilities, and those are just as easy for the defenders to find as for the attackers.

Imagine you have a long list of social security numbers and favorite colors. If you have a single SSN, and want the favorite color, you can use [=vlookup(&lt;cell with the single SSN&gt;, &lt;a box you've dragged around the two columns of data&gt;,2,false)]. The \"2\" means that you want to find the value in the second column (if you have many columns, pick the appropriate column #). There's a reason to use \"false\", but for a crash course just use \"false\".  Something to note is that your unique value always needs to be on the left column you select.\n\nPivot Tables are a little intimidating, but they're useful for quickly summarizing data. This is something you'll want to play around with. All you need to do is select all of the data (including column names) and select [Insert] -&gt; [pivot table]. You can now use the options on the left to select which data you want to show, and how. Drag column names into one of the four boxes below. All you need is a variable in the \"value\" box, but the other boxes let you show how the \"values\" are shown. For instance, dropping \"SSN\" in the Value box, and Favorite Color in the Row Labels box will show you the number of SSNs for each color. If your Value variable is a number, (say you have a third column with salary in it), you should click on its name in the Value box, select \"Value Field Settings\", and pick something like Average or Sum.\n\n"},

[Math to support this, here](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/06/07/safety-is-an-expensive-illusion/). Now, an auto insurance company needs to make money to stay afloat. So if they take the numbers they can get involving the likelihood of one person getting in an accident, environments it most likely will occur in, cars that are more likely, age groups that are more likely, styles of driving that are more likely, etc. they can paint a picture of what a high risk driver is and what a low risk driver is. Using this, they can predict that x out of 100000 people will have this occur. Now, if they insure these 100000 people all for the same rate they will indefinitely lose money because the math doesn't work.\n\nHowever, if they instead charge more for higher risk, and less for low risk, they may have room to make money. Actuaries make 100k+ a year to crunch these numbers for a reason. They HAVE to be accurate, and predictable. Now, they will inevitably pay out in out-of-the-normal-curve situations, but in general it will follow the guidelines they have set for their predictions if they are any good. If they charge so that with these predictions, they make a 3-5% profit margin on the total intake of revenue vs payout. This is how they make money.\n\nNow why should you buy insurance? Well, to put it simply, in cases of home ownership and auto ownership (if you drive at all), it is the law. This is because you can hurt other people. If you hurt Tom, and Tom needs $40,000 for medical bills, you probably can't pay that and Tom will sue you. If you are insured, you can pay a 100-1000 dollar deductible, and they take care of whatever your coverage guidelines deem them to do, indemnifying you. Indemnification being getting you back to where you were before said catastrophe. Make any sense?"},

This is great for astronomers, since that's what they do: view objects as the earth revolves around the sun.  By measuring the angle of the object within the sky at different points in the year, the parsecs can easily be calculated.\n\nI can go into more details if needed!"},

{"title":"ELI5: How do banks make so much money?\n","question_detail":"There is always talk about bankers being rich as hell and corruption. I don't understand how banks are filthy rich if their main job is to guard money. If they give like 5% annually, shouldn't they be losing money?","answer":"A bank doesn't make much money off your deposit, true, but banks have a different mindset when it comes to money. Let's say I start a bank. We call it Schwartz's Bank and you come in and give me $1000 to keep safe for you.  I agree to pay you 2% interest in a simple savings account. \n\nOnce I get your money, I lend it out to Phil. Phil needs $1000 and is willing to pay 8% on the loan. I trust Phil, and the loan is federally insured. How much money in assets do I have?\n\nI got $2000 (the money you gave me, and the money Phil owes me). It may seem like I am just making up money to inflate my worth, but you gave me $1000 to invest to make you that 2% and I invested it to Phil. He owes me $1000 that he is paying on. \n\nPhil makes his first payment of $200, how much money do I have? I now have $2200, because I need to get that $200 payment out on the street ASAP. I loan the $200 and raise my assets by $400. Lather, rinse, repeat. \n\nThis system works if the banks give out loans to qualified borrowers. You can get your money back anytime you want, because I am getting money in on the loans I made. I know that the people I loaned the money to are going to repay me because they have good credit, and if not, the bank is federally insured. \n\nThe interest payed by the borrowers is only used to offset the costs of running a bank (salary of the tellers, cost of printing checks, insurance, etc.)\n\nThe only time this system does not work is when you make a loan to someone who you are pretty sure won't pay it back. You end up loaning out the money you think you will take in, and have no assets to back it up. That is what happened with the recent housing crisis. The banks started losing money and found out that those they had lent the money to were losing money and it created a big cycle that caused bailouts. "},

Yet certain areas have many foreclosures and new homes that aren't selling, yet I read all over the news how house prices are rising.  This doesn't make any sense, since if people can't afford what they're currently priced at, rising prices would just make it even more unaffordable, and thus more unsold homes.  What gives?","answer":"This is the phenomenon of [sticky prices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_(economics\\)).  This an example of a \"bad equilibrium\".  If everyone were to lower the price of houses, then people could sell and buy at the lower price and the market could achieve equilibrium.

{"title":"What is Google Fiber? I heard whispers and geek-talk, but nothing really that just told me what it is.","answer":"I've seen a number of incorrect explanations in this and other threads as to why fiber is 'fast'. Hopefully I can set some things straight.\n\nFirst I want to get two concepts straight, bandwidth and latency.\n\nSuppose I'm working on a 50 page report with you for school but I'm going to be out sick tomorrow. There are a couple ways I can get the report to you. I can call you up and tell you what the report says as you write down all the words. I can also have my mom drive over to your house (which is 10 minutes away) and hand you the paper. \n\nThe first solution has very good latency, it takes very little time for me to say a word and have you write it down. But it has poor bandwidth (it takes us an hour for you to write down the 50 page paper). \n\nThe second solution has worse latency as after I've sent off the paper it takes a full 10 minutes before you get anything. But it makes up for this by having good bandwidth (You get the 50 page paper in 10 minutes as opposed to 60).\n\nBoth bandwidth and latency are important in how we perceive 'speed'. If it seemed like the second solution was inherently the 'fast' one, imagine I'm sending you a paragraph instead of 50 pages instead and you'll see that both are important.\n\nExplanations for why fiber is fast that use 'speed of light' as an argument are misleading you. Coaxial cable for example can actually propagate signal faster than fiber. Not only is the light traveling through stuff that slows it down, but it's basically making a zig-zaggy pattern through the wire as it gets reflected /\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/ so it doesn't have a straight shot from A to B (increasing the distance the photons have to travel).\n\n\nSo what's the real reason it's fast? Unlike the arguments involving the speed of light which appeal to latency, the real significant benefit for speed is in the bandwidth. Turns out the modem (the thing on both ends that sends the signal) for fiber can transition between high and low values that represent ones and zeros a lot faster than in say your DSL or Cable modems.\n\nImagine Fiber is like an auctioneer and a regular dude is like DSL. The auctioneer has the ability to switch between syllables of words a lot faster so he can say more stuff in a smaller amount of time. If the regular dude tries to talk at the same speed, we probably won't understand him as he'll make a lot of mistakes. He'll even have to repeat the bits we missed slowing things down even more. He just can't change syllables well at that speed as the auctioneer can and will have to talk at a slower pace to be the most efficient he can be."},

As someone with no computer science knowledge should I utilize it, or even attempt to?\n\nThank you.","answer":"A virtual machine is just what the name implies.  It's a \"virtual\" machine on your computer.  Say I use Linux as my main operating system.  I can do everything in the world I want to do on Linux except play my favorite game.  I can create a virtual machine on Linux, and install Windows onto that VM.  So now I can be on Linux, and run that virtual machine which has Windows installed.\n\nIt sounds like you really have no need to use a VM.  But if you are interested in doing things like learning other operating systems, you could run a virtual machine on Windows and in that VM install Linux to play with.  You can run a VM in \"windowed\" mode.  So on Windows, you'd have a window like any other application, and in that window would be Linux running.  You could then play around all you wanted with Linux and not have to worry about messing up your Windows install.\n\nAnother use of VMs is in the web server world.  A hosting company could have a bunch of big beefy servers, then each customer gets their own virtual machine on that server.  Say that powerful server can handle 50 VMs.  So 50 customers essentially get their own little server (their own personal VM on the big server) but the hosting company only actually has to own and maintain the 1 piece of hardware."},

{"title":"Why are there still ref's in when fencing has fancy electronics?","answer":"Fencing isn't as simple as giving each point to the competitor who isn't stabbed first.  When both players hit each other, priority is given to the player who starts their attacking motion first.  This is often a matter of judgement and has nothing to do with the lights.  For example, if I lunge to hit my opponent, I have priority.  If, however, my opponent blocks my sword and proceeds to hit me, my opponent gets the point even though both of our lights may go on.  (In fencing terminology, blocking the opponent and counterattacking is known as parry and riposte.)  The lights just indicate that the sword has contacted the opponent.  If you watch a match from close-up between quick fencers, you cannot possibly tell if the sword hit someone or missed by an inch.  That being said, decisions need to be made beyond who got hit first.\n\nThe other purpose of the ref is to manage the flow of the match.  Did a player intentionally step out of bounds?  Did a player position his swordless hand in front of his body illegally?  Is a replay needed?  These are questions where a human is needed to make a judgement.  Like most sports, the majority of calls are straightforward, but you always want a person to be there for those calls that aren't as obvious. "},

Basically, as a farmer, when harvest comes, you can only sell to CWB. They buy all your grain, unconditionally (although price is dependent on quality), and take care of storage, cleaning, transport, sale to customers, and everything else.

CWB would get a major advantage when it comes to sale time by controlling so much grain that they can affect pricing in their favour. \n\nThe downside to such a behemoth of a company is inefficiency. No company that size, especially one that is government regulated, will be working as efficiently as a private firm that is more profit focused.

","answer":"There's quite a few reasons the United States supports Israel:\n\n1. It began during the Cold War. Israel was an important American ally, while most of Israel's Arab enemies (Egypt and Syria in particular) were allied with the USSR. Israel became a way for the US to exert influence in the Middle East.\n\n2. Israel is based on the Jewish faith, which has more in common with Christianity (the dominant faith in the US) than Islam does. Christians and Jews share a lot of scripture, and this influences people's allegiance.\n\n3. Jews make up a very influential voting bloc in the United States, and politicians respond to this incentive.\n\n4. Israel is a Western-style republic, which makes it similar to the US in a way that most Arab nations are not. They also tend to be more culturally liberal than Arab nations (e.g. their treatment of women)."},

{"title":"ELI5: How do judges know how many points to deduct? Why is the top score out of 16? ","question_detail":"They don't really explain the olympic gymnastic deductions precisely which makes me think it's more of a subjective art than a science.","answer":"There is a mathematical approach to answering this question, and better yet, it requires little knowledge of anything to do with the details of how scoring works for a given event.\n\n(For this same reason, I realize that this will not be a very satisfying answer for you. I'm not trolling or anything though, I'm honestly just posting this because I thought you'd find it interesting nonetheless.)\n\nSo, how much of scoring is subjective and how much not? This can be estimated with simple statistics. It would be much, much harder to do if only one judge scored each performance (though still not impossible), but here's the approach I would take.\n\nFor each performance, collect all the scores of all the judges and look at the variations. We know there *must* be some objective criteria for scoring if the scores of all the judges tend to fall within the same range; there's no other explanation if they are not valuing certain elements in the same way.\n\nTo the extent that there is variation in the scores from different judges for the same performance, we can attribute some of that to simple errors. It's possible one judge didn't see an error and gave a slightly higher score than they otherwise would have with perfect observation; likewise, it's possible a judge saw a non-error and accidentally judged it as an error, resulting in a lower score.\n\nAfter collecting enough data to correct for this, you would no doubt still see some variation in scoring from judge to judge. This could be considered the component of the average judge's score that is based on subjective judgments.\n\nHaving said all that, you can get a sense of how scoring works for a particular event by looking up the scoring system used by judges. For example, here is the judging system used for figure skating in the Winter Olympics - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_skating#ISU_Judging_System"},

Are these named in order of when they were established? And in the case of the 101st Airbourne for instance, are there literally also 100 other airbourne divisions? Or is it just the case the the 101st happens to be designated as \"Airbourne\". ","answer":"&gt;What is the difference between the Army and the Marines? Do they serve separate functions nowadays or is it a purely historical distinction? Say a prospective recruit had to choose between either body. What could they reasonably expect from one but not from the other? \n\nArmy and Marine **infantry** are very similar, particularly at the company (125-200) level and below), with some small but important differences in equipment and organizational structure but ultimately close enough to create confusion\n\nNow, that being said, there are significant differences between the two services on a macro scale:\n\nThe Army is much, **much** larger (1.1 million active/reserve/national guard vs. 240k active/reserve Marines) with a much wider breadth of jobs (if you've ever seen *I Am Legend* Will Smith's character is an Army virologist. Suffice to say, the Marines do not have the means to employ virologists). They also possess highly specialized units on a pretty large scale (e.g. 10th Mountain Division) and an extremely robust special forces community, whereas the Marines are much more homogeneous out of necessity. However, this lets Marine commanders unify various aspects of warfare (infantry, logistics, air, fires etc) under a much more junior commander (relatively speaking) and this allows the Marines to provide a small but very important asset to national defense and foreign policy: Marine Expeditionary Units. These are small flotillas (obviously this is done in conjunction with the Navy) carrying a battalion of infantry, attached supporting arms, a reinforced squadron of assault and attack helicopters, Harrier attack jets, and the necessary logistic support for two weeks of operations. This allows rapid response to flare up crises in the Atlantic or Pacific.\n\n&gt;What's the logic behind the names of divisions (is that even the right term?) like \"1st Marines\" and \"5th Marines\" etc.? Are these named in order of when they were established? And in the case of the 101st Airbourne for instance, are there literally also 100 other airbourne divisions? Or is it just the case the the 101st happens to be designated as \"Airbourne\". \n\nI have no idea how the Army does things but the Marine Corps is pretty straight forward: In military structure, there are 3 component divisions in a corps (\"The Marine *Corps*): 1st Division is out of MCB Pendleton, CA,  2nd Division, MCB Lejeurne, NC, and 3rd Division, MCB Smedley Butler, Okinawa. Each division has 3 regiments, and each regiment 3 battalions (of infantry, I won't get into attachments etc). \"1st Marines\" *usually* refers to 1st Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment. The notation would look like 1/1, 3/5, etc. The tricky part is understanding the rules to which regiments get which numbered battalions, but that's getting a little too thick in the details."},
{"title":"ELI5:  How does a CPU do 'math'?","question_detail":"I get that a CPU at its basic 'core' is responsible for taking data from one place and putting them in another place, and is also responsible for doing basic arithmetic; however, I still don't get how we take electricity, run it through capacitors and transistors and stuff and we get the processor to do math.  Honestly, I don't even get how the processor can 'read' instructions at its most basic level.  Can anyone explain these steps?  Thanks!","answer":"Transistors in digital logic circuits are used mostly as switches. You want the transistors to be either all the way OFF (no current flow) or all the way ON (lots of current flow). (They intrinsically are not digital, they are analog. You can also use them in-between OFF and ON, such as in an amplifier circuit like those driving loudspeakers in your stereo.)  \n  \n\nUsing just a few transistors, you can build very simple logic circuits to implement binary digital logic (called \"Boolean\" logic after the guy who invented it). It turns out that you can build any digital logic function with a combination of only three simple circuit types, such as AND/OR/NOT. By combining those simple circuits, more complicated circuits can be made (such as an adder, a multiplexer, etc.). You can use those circuits to make even more complicated ones. Like a CPU. \n\nIt's like if you had a bunch of little Lego blocks, and you could use those to make larger Lego blocks, and you could then use those to make even larger Lego blocks, and so on. Today's integrated circuits use more than a billion transistors to make something that is very complex, but it is built up out of very simple things.\nTransistors are great for building these things because they are small, fast, reliable, cheap, and don't use a lot of power. These are all important properties when you are trying to make something that uses a billion or more devices.   \n  \nWhen a CPU reads an instruction, it often does it from DRAM or SRAM memory chips inside the computer. It changes the voltage levels on some of its control pin outputs that tell the memory chips \"Give me the information at this address\". It provides the address by setting the bits on the pins that make up the address bus - high voltage means 1, low voltage means 0. The memory reads that address and sends back the contents that are stored there in a similar fashion. It toggles some control pins to say \"Here ya go\" and puts its data pins at the right voltages to represent the 1s and 0s corresponding to that binary data. The CPU now looks at the data bus pins and reads in that data into its internal memory.   \n  \nThe memory chips don't know the difference between \"instructions\" (commands for the CPU to do something) and \"data\" (numbers for the CPU to use with those commands). But the program that the CPU is running keeps track of command addresses and data addresses, so the CPU knows which is which and uses them appropriately. "},

{"title":"ELI5: SSL certifications, Multi-Factor Authentication and SQL injections.","question_detail":"I've got the definitions for each, but I just need to read it in a way that's easier to comprehend and explain as well :(","answer":"SSL uses something called public key cryptography, where there are two keys. Using some clever math, one of the keys can be used to encrypt, and the other will be able to decrypt. One is kept secret and the other can be made public. Anyone that has the public key can now create a message that can only be read by the one person with the private key. With SSL, the server holds the private key and the website users use the public key (which the server sends when the user connects).\n\nThe user generates a single two-way key (both encrypt and decrypt with the same key) and encrypt *that* key with the original public key, and sends it to the server (so we now have a key encrypted with another key). As the server is the only one who can decrypt the first message, the transmission is safe.\n\nFrom then on, both sides use the two way key, and nobody in the middle can read the messages.\n\nThe certificate file contains some text information, as well as the public key. This is only really useful if you know you can trust them (they could be lying!). Again, using clever math, it is possible for someone else to 'stamp' this certificate, and for us to verify the stamp. As long as we trust the stamper,  and trust that they only stamp good certificates, we can trust the certificate.\n\nHow do we trust the stamp? Well, our browsers come with a list of pre-trusted certificates - nothing more!\n\n(It's actually possible to read the messages in the middle, even when they are encrypted and seemingly trusted - something called Man In The Middle.

Do you need to switch passports when you switch citizenship?

A Passport is a document proving that you are a citizen of a country.  No one has the automatic right to enter a country that is not his own.  A Passport is proof you use in exercising your rights.  When you are in a difficult situation abroad a passport proves what kind of citizen you are and you are therefore entitled to assistance from your country of citizenship.  Most countries prefer (and some like the USA require) you to enter the country on their passport.

Interference is a way how waves interact with each other.\n\nBasically, sound is just a wave (as you speak your organs modify the way the air from your lungs leaves your body).\n\nThe easiest way to comprehend it is to try it with water. Drop two small stones in the water, not very far from each away and look at the waves. As you can see, there are places where the water goes up like hills and places where the water goes down like a valley.\n\nNow when the waves meet, they interfere. Suddenly the water should make a hill and a valley at the same spot! So the same spot is pushed up and down at the same time. Now, depending on a few things, the stronger wave will put trough his will, but the resulting hill/valley won't be so high/deep how it would have been without interference. If the waves are equally strong, they will just cancel each other out. That's called destructive interference.\n\nBut there is constructive interference too. That happens when the two waves push the water in the same direction in the same spot. Both push the water in the same direction, so the water goes further up/down then it would have it there was just one wave.\n\nAnd that's basically what happens with the sound of a car. It just happens that the reflected waves interfere constructively right by your window on the higher floors."},

This particular list is strange because there's no 'answer', even though the numbers in your list get smaller and smaller as you go on. \n\nThe way we decide on whether an infinite list of numbers 'adds up to' is by adding the first few numbers, and see if there's a pattern. We call the answers '**partial sums**'.For example, let's take a look at\n\n1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + .....\n\n* Adding up the first term gives you **1/2**\n* The first two terms gives you 1/2 + 1/4 = **3/4**\n* The first three give you 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 = **7/8**\n* The first four gives  1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 = **15/16** ...and so on\n\nThere's a pattern here! We got 1/2, 3/4, 7/8, 15/16, 31/32.... and more generally (2^n -1)/2^n. Now as we continue this pattern, adding up more and more numbers, our answers get closer and closer to 1. In the end, the partial sums *settle down* at 1 - because we can get as close as you like to 1 by adding up enough numbers. Because of this, we decide that the whole infinite list 'adds up to' 1. That might seem like a strange reason, but infinite sums are strange - you couldn't sit down with a calculator and add up all of these infinitely many numbers, no matter how hard you tried! \n\nNow back to your particular example. Let's look at what happens when we add up the first few numbers.\n\n1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 ...\n\n* Adding up the first term gives you 1\n* The first two terms gives you 1 + 1/2 =  3/2\n* The first three give you 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 = 11/6\n* The first four gives  1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = 50/24\n* ...and so on\n\nIt's more difficult to see a pattern here. It's possible to show that [these numbers we're calculating have to get bigger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_test) but we won't worry about that too much. Instead, let's write out some more of your infinite list.\n\n* 1 + 1/2 +  1/3 + 1/4  +  1/5 + 1/6 + 1/7 + 1/8  +   1/9 + ...\nNow I'm going to replace some of the numbers with *smaller* numbers:\n* 1 + 1/2 + (1/4 + 1/4) + (1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8) + (1/16 + ...\n\n1/3 was bigger than 1/4; also 1/5, 1/6 and 1/7 were bigger than 1/8, and so on. I've also put some brackets in, and each bracket adds up to 1/2. By continuing the pattern, I can keep on grouping together numbers which add to 1/2. I can keep on doing this forever, building up 1/2, and another 1/2, and another - in other words I can make the second list add up to a number as big as I like, just by adding 1/2!\n\nBut the original list had bigger numbers than the second! This means that I can make the original list add up to as big a number as I like also! That's why we say that the sum 'equals infinity' - because it gets *as big as you like*.\n\nHopefully that sheds some light on the matter for you. For infinite lists to add up, the numbers have to get smaller and smaller, approaching 0. But we've seen that the opposite isn't true: just becuase the numbers go to 0 doesn't mean there's an infinite sum!"},
{"title":"Why are companies allowed to charge you to tell you how much their services will cost?","question_detail":"I can't wrap my head around this.  My camera broke, and I sent a message to the nearest camera reply store simply asking if my issue is a fixable one.

They are paying the repair guy/girl by the hour and it takes time for that person to inspect your camera in this circumstance. For example if the inspection was free of charge, and say it took 2 hours. The company would be paying their hourly wage, and that is 2 hours in which the company is not making any profit.

What is actually happening during the typing of letters? Something called an \"Ajax GET request\"? What is this, how does it work, etc.\n1. How does the search engine overwrite your current webpages if you type into Chrome's search bar, then magically disappear and reload your previous page if you erase the search bar? Is it just an overlay?","answer":"This won't be technically correct/detailed, but it should get the point across.\n\nWhen you go to a traditional webpage (lets say XKCD) the server sends you back a bunch of information that tell you what should be displayed.  This would be done synchronously.  I send a request, wait for the response, then send another request.\n\nWell google does the same thing except it also tells your browser \"hey, let me know whenever you type something and I'll give you some more info based on that\"  This is done via AJAX which stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.    Asynchronous theoretically means that it's done in the background.  I don't need to wait for the server to respond to type my next character.\n\nBasically at the same time as I'm typing, my webbrowser is sending these little requests to google (GETs) letting them know what I'm typing and they're responding with some results  They're also telling my browser to change what it's showing me to fit the new results.\n\nAs far as how it overwrites your current page when you type in the title bar, yes basically it's just overlaying another webpage (google search results) on top of your current one.  If you cancel it then chrome just throws out this overlay and you see your old webpage again.  If you accept the search it replaces your current page."},

{"title":"ELI5 The Future of Wildlife Populations","question_detail":"I have heard that we are in the middle of a mass extinction (caused by us). What can we expect to happen to the wildlife on this planet within the immediate or distant future? Are the measures being taken to soften the blow effective?","answer":"&gt; What can we expect to happen to the wildlife on this planet within the immediate or distant future?\n\nEntire species are likely to die out. Not only is this shitty because hey, animals are pretty awesome and hold a lot of culteral ties to different groups of people, but it disrupts the food chain and can create overpopulation of other, less-great animals as well. \n\nTake the [bullfrog population](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/09/0928_040928_bullfrog.html) in the US at the time of that story: there's an overpopulation of bullfrogs, which carry a certain fungus that kills off other species of frogs. Not only are these dudes killing off other frog species by spreading the fungus all around, but they're eating off a ton of awesome animals and then making tens of thousands of more little frog babies which will eat off even more of those awesome animals. This is bound to end up causing super low populations of good species (species of animals that kill off predatory bugs, filter water, or do other great things for the environment around them) because there aren't many predators of the bullfrog to kill them off.\n\nWhile the example posted above was caused by bullfrogs being introduced to the US by humans, climate change and water pollution also force animals to have problems which cause weaker populations (like [whales](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/09/070910094122.htm) or [salmon](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=earth-talks-salmon) in the Pacific Northwest. It's important to note that entire runs of salmon have become extinct due to climate change and pollution.)\n\n&gt;Are the measures being taken to soften the blow effective?\n\nThey may or not be. There's this thing called legacy pollution, which is essentially tens of years of old pollution sitting in dirt and water with nowhere to go. This pollution continues, and will continue, to affect the animals that come near it until we successfully find a way to eliminate the population. Even if we were to cut every bad thing for the environment out right this minute, that old pollution would still be hanging around, being eaten by bugs, who are eaten by fish, who are eaten by whales, etc.\n\nA positive example of a species that has come back from being endangered/threatened due to pollution (as well as hunting) is the bald eagle. Up until a few years ago, the bald eagle population was in rapid decline due to legacy pollution (specifically, DDT inhibiting the calcium production in egg-laying bald eagles. The lack of calcium in bald eagle eggs would cause the shells to cave in, killing the growing baby birds inside). In the Pacific Northwest especially, though, the bald eagle population has actually been rising at a pretty high rate."},

Probably the most important concept you'll learn in Calculus is a concept called \"Taylor Series\" that allows hard problems, say, sin(e^ .2), to be solved. I won't go into specifics, but your calculator will derive a function that's different from the original function but is pretty dang close. You should get an estimated answer very close to the actual answer, called the 'error'. Usually the error is so small it's called insignificant.\n\nSo yeah, it calculates."},

","answer":"As a quick side note, keep in mind that the Vice President was originally created merely to stop states from throwing away electoral college votes. \n\nThe Founders set up the College and were afraid that states would just cast their votes for whoever was from their state. So they gave them a second vote on the condition that it be for someone outside their own state. So then, to stop them from just throwing away that vote they declared that the runner up would get to be Vice President, therefore making states have a vested interest in that vote. \n\nJust some historical perspective on the role for you.

{"title":"How does C14 dating work?","question_detail":"A coworker of mine (who is a pastor) was telling me today about a friend of his who worked in a lab. He said that readings on a single sample would range from the thousands to the millions of years. The researchers at the lab would take 100 measurements of this sample, average them, and stamp the date. I'm almost certain that this isn't correct, but I don't know enough about the process to deny his claim. I know C14 isn't 100% accurate, but I don't think it is as inaccurate as he thinks it is. Can someone please explain this to me (like i'm five)?\n\nedit: typos","answer":"Basically it's like an hour glass.  As the C14 decays, it's similar to the sand moving to the lower part of the glass.  The half-life is a constant property of C14 and tells you after how much time will there be half of what you started with.  The half-life of the hour glass would be 30mins.  \n\nNow imagine if you will, that this hourglass had the ability to change how quickly the sand moved, based on how much sand there was in the top.... More sand, moves faster, less sand moves slower.  This allows the hour-glass to ALWAYS be half full after 30mins.  \n\nDuring an animal's lifetime, it's always acquiring c14, so we're always adding sand to the top of the hourglass.  At the same time, c14 is decaying (sand is moving to the bottom).  The top part of the glass, is the animal.\n\nThe starting amount of c14(sand) is always the same in living things.  When the living thing dies, it stops taking in c14.  We stop adding sand to the top, and let it all flow to the bottom.  \n\nSince we know how long it takes for half the sand(c14) to be gone, how much sand(c14) we started with, and how much sand(c14) is left in the top(animal), we can figure out how long ago we stopped adding sand to the top. ie. the animal died."},
{"title":"How come some people are extremely allergic to even tiny amounts of things like shell fish, peanuts, etc.?","answer":"there are specific allergies because there are these specific few groups of proteins that people with allergies have drastic reactions to (explained by the immune system response effect above). generally these allergies are developed at a young age if you are born/raised in a 'relatively clean' place like in developed countries. children born in less sanitized places often are able to develop a better immune system while growing up and so 'peanut butter allergies' and 'shell fish allergies' are less common. that is why when people from developed countries travel to developing countries, they often encounter illnesses very easily as compared to native people. suddenly they are exposed to germs that 'did not exist' in their home country. whereas vice versa is rare because children born in developing countries grow up fighting these illnesses so their immune system is 'used to' it and when they travel to clean environments, they have no problem.

{"title":"ELI5: Why do we shiver when peeing or smelling something?","answer":"For peeing, I believe it's because of the sciencey term, \"post-micturition convulsion syndrome\", which pretty much means after-urination-shudder. Scientists and their jargon.\n\nAnyways, there are two main theories about this. The first is that because urine contains a lot of the body's heat, when it exits the body, much heat is also taken out from the body, and thus you shiver. The other, more complicated theory, relates to our nervous system. Normally, we don't \"concentrate\" every second of the day to prevent ourselves from urinating, as our autonomic nervous system takes over this task and involuntarily controls our urination, among other things (closing our eyes when sneezing). So, when we choose to urinate, we are voluntarily relaxing the valves and tensing our bladder, preparing to urinate, thus taking over control of the unconscious process we've had before. This switchover is said to cause the twitch or shiver because when the autonomic nervous system controls our body from urinating, loads of chemicals such as epinephrine is used, and even more chemicals are used if we \"really need to go\", so we don't have an accident in the middle of the street, and so when you manually take over this process and urinate in the washroom, this sudden change may cause a twitching.\n\nI don't understand the second theory too much myself, so if anyone else can give a better explanation, please do. \n\n**tl;dr**: Two reasons: heat escaping our body from urine and because of the switchover from the autonomic nervous system to us voluntarily taking over the process."},
{"title":"ELI5 how do fiber optics work?","question_detail":"The glowy lights. And other uses of it. What is it, how'd it get discovered/invented, etc.\n\nDo not be disappoint. ","answer":"Fiber-optic lines are strands of optically pure glass as thin as a human hair. They are arranged in bundles called optical cables and used to transmit light signals over long distances. Enough of what they are, let's get into how they work.\n\n\nIf you look closely at a single optical fiber, you will see that it has the following parts:\n\n* **Core** - Thin glass center of the fiber where the light travels\n\n* **Cladding** - Outer optical material surrounding the core that reflects the light back into the core\n\n* **Buffer** coating - Plastic coating that protects the fiber from damage and moisture\n\nOptical fibers come in two types:\n\n* **Single-mode fibers**\n\n* **Multi-mode fibers**\n\n\nSingle-mode fibers have small cores and transmit infrared laser light. \n\nMulti-mode fibers have larger cores  and transmit infrared light from light-emitting diodes (LEDs).\n\n\n\nSuppose you want to shine a flashlight beam down a long, straight hallway. Just point the beam straight down the hallway -- light travels in straight lines, so it is no problem. What if the hallway has a bend in it? You could place a mirror at the bend to reflect the light beam around the corner. What if the hallway is very winding with multiple bends? You might line the walls with mirrors and angle the beam so that it bounces from side-to-side all along the hallway. This is exactly what happens in an optical fiber.The light in a fiber-optic cable travels through the core (hallway) by constantly bouncing from the cladding (mirror-lined walls), a principle called **total internal reflection**. Because the cladding does not absorb any light from the core, the light wave can travel great distances.\n\n\nHopefully this helps. :D\n\n"},
{"title":"Why does oxygen at its purest form stay low to Earth's surface, while Ozone is at the top of Earth's atmosphere?","question_detail":"This is a question that's bugging me and its admittedly coming from limited knowledge, but according to my elementary understanding of the subject, human beings breathe air. The component that i'm familiar with that we use the most is known as oxygen. Ozone is made up of three oxygen atoms bound together, correct? Shouldn't Ozone be heavier and thus sink below purer forms of oxygen?","answer":"Ozone is at the top of the atmosphere because it is created there. Radiation from space smacks into the upper atmosphere and imparts its energy to the stuff up there (i.e. Oxygen gas), causing it to ionize and recombine into different forms (i.e. Ozone). Ozone isn't as stable as O2, so over time (before it diffuses through the atmosphere) it breaks down and becomes regular Oxygen gas again.\n\nEven still, the mass of molecules doesn't always tell us exactly how they'll arrange themselves in the atmosphere. There's plenty of movement and stirring going on all the time in the air. It's enough to keep most of the common gasses (nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide) mixed fairly well, even though they all have different masses."},

{"title":"[ELIF] What is Anti-Folk music?","answer":"The anti-folk scene came about as a reaction to the folk scene in 1980s Greenwich Village.\n\nBy then, the political messages of the folk scene of the 1960s had become fairly commercialized and mainstream. The \"outside\" feel it had was now attracting attention from the mainstream, and many felt it had become more about pandering to that mainstream and selling records instead of challenging people to think. (Remember, the folk movement was born out of venues like Woodstock counterculture and was greatly concerned with things like racial and gender equality, make love not war, etc.)\n\nHence, anti-folk was born as a way to draw attention to what they felt was the loss of these values. It wasn't necessarily trying to restore the focus to earnest political messages, but rather more just about pointing out that folk music itself was now just a genre like any other and didn't deserve to be granted special respect for the claims it making for itself.\n\nOne of the confusing things about anti-folk is that it's a reaction to what folk *had become*, not what it started out to be. To highlight this difference, anti-folk musicians would sometimes try to interpret the original values of folk for their modern time.\n\nOne musician you might know that was very into anti-folk is Beck, and an example of anti-folk music is his single *Loser*. He felt that if one was to apply the original values of folk music to the time (the late 80s / early 90s), one thing an early folk singer might point out is how self-aggrandizing and narcissistic rap music was. So, he made a rap song that said the opposite of what most rap of the time was about.\n\nInstead of rapping about how awesome and rich and powerful he was, he rapped about how he was a loser. Furthermore, he felt pretty bad about his skills as a rapper, so it was honest (a quality valued by early folk singers that had been lost in its commercialization, he felt).\n\nThe listening audience, to put it mildly, did not get the irony and instead took it literally, appointing him head of the slacker generation. He objected to this, pointing out that he had never slacked a day in his life and they'd missed the point of the song...but the din or acceptance drowned out his protests."},

Tupac owned up to this, saying the accusations were true, while Biggie and Faith said it was false. Tupac's single \"Hit 'em up\" was a shameless assault on Biggie, Faith and the Bad Boy label, which was owned by Sean Combs (aka Puffy, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, Diddy). All this fighting made it easy to point fingers when Tupac was shot and killed. No knows who killed either of the two. The one thing we can agree upon is they are both greatly missed and were taken far too soon. It's fitting to end with a relevant lyric;\n\n\"How many many brothers fell victim to the streets?\n\nRest in peace young nigga, there's a heaven for a G,\n\nI'd be a lie if I told you I've never thought of death\n\nMy nigga, we're the last ones left, but life goes on\"\n\n-Tupac Shakur"},

{"title":"ELI5: Medicare/Medicaid, what's wrong with it, and what is being proposed to fix it.","answer":"Before Medicare, old people had a tough time getting insurance.  Insurance companies did not want to cover them for health care.  The older a person is, the more likely a person is to get cancer, need hospitalizations, and other costly care.  The price was expensive, and basically just wealthy people could afford it.  More than half of senior citizens had no health insurance.\n\nThe government stepped in to insure these people who couldn't get insurance.  They had every single working person pay into the Medicare fund.  Then, when people reached retirement age, they could get this government insurance.  Everyone pays into it, and everyone who lives to be old enough gts to use it.\n\nMedicaid came around to help another group--people who are too sick or poor to be able to get health insurance.  It was limited to children,women, and parents of children, but the new health care law (Obamacare) will extend it to single men, too.  In order to qualify, you need to meet income requirements.  Obamacare also raised the amount of money people can make to qualify for Medicaid.\n\nSome problems with Medicare were that the government wasn't allowed to negotiate drug costs with drug companies.  So, like, if you have Blue Cross Blue Shield health insurance, that company can go talk to drug companies and negotiate the prices that they will pay for the drugs.  It keeps costs down.  the government couldn't do that until the Obamacare law was passed.  This is one way it will save money.  \n\nStill, Medicare takes up a huge portion of our country's budget.  It's the second most costly thing, after our defense spending.  Some people, especially wealthy people, hate it because it's socialist.  Poor people benefit the most from it, while wealthy people benefit the least.  \n\nSoon, we won't be taking in enough money to cover the costs of Medicare.  baby Boomers are retiring, and as they get older, they're going to be spending a lot through Medicare.  To solve it, Paul Ryan (Mitt Romney's VP pick) wants to give seniors a voucher that gives them some money to help them buy private insurance.  the government would no longer be providing the insurance.  Poor elderly people might not be able to get coverage even with the vouchers because they wouldn't have enough money to cover the difference.  some people want the voucher amount to be related to how much people paid into Medicare during their lives.  However, that means people who didn't make much money won't get much help.  That means elderly people will once again have a hard time getting health insurance.\n\nObamacare raised the amount of money people making over a quarter of a million dollars will pay into Medicare.  basically, he's having wealthy people pay a little more so that the country can continue providing health insurance to elderly people.  Again, some people hate that because they see it as \"socialist.\""},

{"title":"Why does (consumer) technology like smart-phones and computers get slightly better every year?","question_detail":"So, it may sound like a silly question I guess, but one does everything get only slightly better each year in the consumer tech industry?\n\nI love technology, but I'll admit I'm not the savviest guy when it comes to specs and the like. I'm just curious as to why we get slightly better versions of things instead of just huge upgrades every once in a while? Is it because tech is just so fluid, and things become cheaper to make per year, or what?\n\nI really hope you all understand my question, as I guess it seems a bit confusing...I'll try to clarify it further if need be.","answer":"I think it is a combination of keeping competitive and managing risk. If you wait to put out a vastly different product every year or two, competitors who are putting out small upgrades more frequently might take away all of the available market before you even field your new product. It is also much easier to continually make small improvements and not screw it up than it is to make a huge change all at once. Of course, you need to balance that with the cost of making/testing/deploying all of those small upgrades, particularly when it comes to hardware.  It is cheaper to make incremental improvements and bug fixes to software, so it is done more often.   \n  \nAnother potential advantage to making more frequent but smaller improvements is that it gives you the advantage of getting more feedback from customers about what they like than less frequent improvements. Companies don't usually really know what customers value, they are guessing. They need to put different variations into the market to learn what people will buy and what they won't buy.  For example, at the peak of the Walkman, Sony would introduce dozens of new models each year in Japan. Most of them would not survive and never even be seen outside of the Japanese market. The ones that did well there would be sold in other countries. Kind of like an evolutionary model of marketing."},
{"title":"Why are gas prices constantly changing?","answer":"Gas is derived from oil.  Oil prices fluctuate rapidly, which causes gas prices to fluctuate rapidly.  This naturally leads to the question of why oil prices fluctuate.  Oil is scarce.  Oil is expensive to find, retrieve, transport and refine.  The combination of which means that oil is controlled by a small group of countries/governments (due to barriers to entry).  Oil is also extremely valuable.  Demand for oil is highly inelastic (changes in prices have a relatively small impact on demand for the product), meaning the market will allow accept fluctuation.  Oil is currently produced at a rate just slightly above the demand for the product, which means any world event that may restrict the flow of oil even a little bit (like potential conflict in an oil product country, or a major oil rig disaster) will cause a run on oil.  The combination of all of these things causes oil prices to rapidly fluctuate. This, in turn, causes it to be a magnet for speculators, which itself drives even more price fluctuation.  It's basically a perfect storm of instability."},
{"title":"ELI5:  Olive Oil.  'Virgin' vs. 'Extra Virgin'?  Italian vs. Greek?  What are the rules of thumb for using olive oil and the different types of olive oil?","answer":"Aevum1's answer is good.  I'll just add a few points on top of that:\n\n* Most \"Italian\" olive oil sold in the USA isn't made from Italian olives.  Basically, since Italian olive oil has such a good reputation in the USA, some Italian companies figured that they can buy cheap olive oil from other countries (e.g., Spain, Morocco, Greece), put it in a bottle with an Italian label and slap a \"Bottled in Italy\" label on it, and get a lot of money for it.\n* Olive oil is like wine; there's a lot of different types of olives grown in different locations, the oil from each of them tastes different, and also the way they're grown and harvested makes a difference.  However, while today with wine you can easily buy bottles labeled with the place where the wine was grown (e.g., Bordeaux, Sonoma, etc.) and the type of grape (e.g., Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, etc.), the olive oil market is still very generic and you will rarely see a description of what type of olives were used and where they were grown.\n* The European olive oil export industry is hit with periodic scandals where they adulterate their \"extra virgin olive oil\" with cheaper oils for export.  Basically, cheap \"Italian\" olive oil in an American supermarket is often dubious.  See [this *Los Angeles Times* article](http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/15/business/la-fi-olive-oil-20100715), which reports on an UC Davis study that concluded that two thirds of the \"extra virgin\" olive oil for sale in a typical California supermarket does not actually meet the standard.\n* If you live in the USA, you should very seriously consider American olive oilâmostly made in California.  You can get some pretty good oil for a good price.  The Trader Joe stores' house brand good, as is [California Olive Ranch](http://www.californiaoliveranch.com/).

{"title":"ELI5 - Analog versus digital TV signal ","question_detail":"I kind of understand that digital is first converted to numbers and is then decoded after transmission while analog is just like shaking a piece of string tied to something (signal eventually reaches what 'string' is tied to, but since they're both sent via cable wires - how do they differ?","answer":"Let's start with old CRT TVs. They made an image on screen by scanning an electron beam across it, making phosphors glow. The more intense the beam, the brighter the glow. The intensity of the beam was determined by the voltage of the signal that went into the electron gun as it scanned. So the signal was varied very rapidly as the beam was quickly scanned across the screen, making a picture appear. Since human vision is relatively slow, this would appear to people as a picture. Changing the image with successive scans makes the picture appear to move. \n  \nThis was all originally done in analog (digital didn't really exist yet). One of the problems with analog is that everything has to be precise...a small error in the signal would cause a brightness defect in the picture, making it noisy. And there are always things that cause errors, such as bad weather, interference with other electronics, etc.   \n  \nWhen digital techniques are used, the same kinds of things happen to make the picture. But the transmission of the signal uses digital logic to help avoid errors. Instead of transmitting a signal that (almost) directly corresponds to a voltage level in a signal, the signal is first converted to a number. For example, 0 volts is 0000, 0.1 V = 0001, 0.2V = 0010, etc.  The transmitted signal is now a string of numbers that represent the signal, and it is converted back to voltages at the receiver.  \n  \nThis is valuable in a few ways.  The biggest is that when you are transmitting only strings of 0s and 1s that are put together to represent a number, there's less ambiguity. A bit coming in has to be either low (0) or high (1). If you receive an intermediate value, you don't send it on to the picture directly, creating noise. For example, if the reciever is expecting 0 volts coming in represents 0 and 0.5 volts coming in represents 1, everything it receives at 0.25V or lower is called a 0, everything higher than 0.25V is called a 1. Intermediate values caused by noise in the transmission channel never make it to the screen, unless they are so large that a 0 gets interpreted incorrectly as a 1, or vice versa. And... \n  \n...the second biggest advantage is that when you are transmitting numbers, it is fairly easy to throw in a few extra numbers that help ensure that the number that was received is the same number that was transmitted. For example, you can use \"even parity\" and throw in an extra number so that a group of numbers always has an even number of 1's. If the receiver sees an odd number of 1's in the group, it knows that there's been an error. \n  \nThat is nice, but doesn't fix things. But it is possible to put in Error Correcting Codes (ECC) in blocks of numbers that make it possible to not only detect errors, but to *fix* some of them. Math is cool.  Sure, you use a little bandwidth up with those extra numbers, but you get a cleaner signal at the receiver. And you can get the bandwidth back.   \n  \nDigital transmission is nice because you can compress digital signals easily and fast, and do decompression at the receiver (more math). So you can pack more signal into less bandwidth. So besides sticking in things like ECC, you can add in extra information that you want to send, like a channel guide.   \n  \nAnother nice advantage of digital is that you can use computer-type digital logic circuits to manipulate the image, using software. Want to put a picture in a picture? Want to overlay some graphics? Want to change the ratio of Red:Green:Blue? Want to equalize the sound? You can do all of those things and more with algorithms implemented in software, manipulating a digital signal.  If you want to do those things in analog, you probably need a special circuit to do each one.   "},

{"title":"eli5 Why do we read from left to right? ","question_detail":"Unlike Hebrew which is the opposite. But they're both read from top to bottom. How was this established as the \"natural\" way to read?","answer":"Short answer: because most people are right-handed. \n\nFor the first written languages such as Hebrew, people started writing by engraving letters into stone. Since most people were right-handed, it was easier to hold the chisel with the left hand and hammer it with the right hand. If you think about it, it's a lot easier to do this right to left and would be uncomfortable to do it the other way unless you hold the hammer in your left hand. Eventually, Hebrew and other ancient languages moved on to be written on animal skin, but people were already used to writing right-to-left.\n\nWhen Indo-European written languages such as Ancient Greek and Latin came about, papyrus and ink was already the common medium for writing. Since most people were right-handed, they would get ink smudges on the paper if they wrote right-to-left. Writing from left to right eliminated this problem. "},

Here you are, with all these piles of cash, with no explanation of how you got it all (because you can't exactly write \"drug dealing\" on your tax return.)

There is a pressure sensor on the tank, and with a bit of math you can determine the level in percentage in the tank.\n\nSo, water is flowing in. Right now the valve is open, the pump is running at 75% of capacity, and the level in the tank is 83%. You'd use the PLC to ramp up the pump speed to, let's say, 95%. Of course, as we raise the speed of the pump the faster the water is going to be removed from the tank. The level lowers to 50%, and the pump finds a sweet spot (of 87%) where the rate in is equal to the rate out. Perfect.\n\nThis is a very simple example but here's what's going on behind the scenes:\n\nWe have one input signal, pressure. We have three output signals, one to open the valve, another to turn on the pump, and the last to control the speed of the pump. Our goal is to use the input signal to control the output signals in a manner that will deliver the desired result.\n\nOn to PLC programming. PLCs are typically programmed in a language called \"Ladder Logic.\" It's done this way for ease of troubleshooting, and ease of reading. Each rung in ladder logic has two components: the left side establishes conditions, and the right side performs an action if the condition is \"True.\" Going back to our example, one would program the outputs like this (in pseudo code): IF LEVEL IN TANK IS GREATER THAN 50%, OPEN VALVE, TURN ON PUMP, AND CONTROL SPEED TO MAINTAIN LEVEL OF 50%. [This is what the code would look like on an AB PLC.](http://i.imgur.com/SzarW.png) I excluded the pump speed control because it's quite a bit more complicated. But you can use your imagination.\n\nAs far as being a PLC programmer, there are two major things you need to know: The first is how the program works. The second is much more challenging, and is what really determines a good programmer. That is the knowledge of how certain actions will affect a real life process. For example, take another look at the image linked above. Theoretically this will work fine, but in reality if you were to use this code you'd burn out the valve and the motor. The very nature of an analog signal (signal from the pressure sensor) means that you will never read exactly 50%. It will always be 50.00001% or 49.99999% percent. As the level approaches 50% it is bound to fluctuate above and below the 50% mark. With every fluctuation you are sending the signals to open and close the valve, and to turn on and off the pump. This can be hundreds of times per second. Granted the physical valve and motor will not respond this fast, it will still be opening and closing very very quickly. Enough to wear it out.\n\nI looked through the post saw a few questions which I will answer: A PLC is interacted with on a normal basis via 2 different methods: computer program which is called an HMI (human machine interface) in the industry, and physical pushbuttons, nobs, etc. You will never see someone interacting directly with the PLC code in order to run a process.\n\nI wish I could say there is a good PLC crash course, but there really isn't. It depends on experience more than anything else. If you want experience, go get the demo version of RSLogix 500 from Allen Bradley, and start playing around. Learn what the instructions do. If you have access to a PLC, write a small program, fudge some numbers and see how the program responds. Did it do what you expected? Why not?\n\nThis barely scratches the surface. Let me know if I can provide any additional information."},
{"title":"ELI5: Blacklights","question_detail":"Why do they come off as purple? and how do they do what they do?","answer":"They give off ultraviolet light. It's light with higher energy than blue light (yes, the different colors of light have different amount of energy per photon).\n\nTake a look at a chart of the color spectrum: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Rendered_Spectrum.png\n\nSince all light moves at a certain speed and behaves a lot like waves, it means that the photons \"swings\" back and forth between the top and the bottom of the wave. The numbers in that chart stands for nanometers, which describes the wavelength, the distance between the tops or bottoms of the wave. \n\nDifferent colors have different waves. Since ultraviolet has higher energy, it \"swings faster\", so the distance is shorter between the tops.\n\nThe reason for looking purple is that not all light from the lamps is ultraviolet (outside the spectrum we cans ee), and also because some of the ultraviolet light that hits things \"lose\" some energy to it when it bounces off, so the light that is reflected becomes blue/purple.\n\nSome inks are specifically made to absorb ultraviolet light and reflect it as visible light by absorbing parts of the energy. They are well known as \"invisible inks\"."},

As far as the criminal court is concerned, it's the same as if you'd pled guilty - there is no trial, you are sentenced. BUT, as far as the civil court goes, you have not admitted any guilt, therefore anyone wishing to press civil charges relating to the crime has to prove to a claims court that you were responsible for the damages.

I don't really understand how it works or what it does. I need to know A) how to tell if my data can do a T-Test or not and B) how to run my data through a T-Test and how to interpret the end result. Thank you so much!","answer":"I recommend using the textbook for the class you're taking. Hopefully that'll have the right information at the level you're at. If it isn't clear, then maybe you aren't the only person in class who doesn't know what's up, so it's worth bringing up to the prof/teacher.\n\nThat being said, a t-test is a \"test\" in that it tests a hypothesis. The hypothesis in this case depends on what kind of t-test you do, but usually it is that your test statistic (in this case \"t-value\") is equal to zero. You can see the symbols of how to calculate the t-statistic on the Wikipedia page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test), but, in words, you're finding out how many standard deviations your estimate is away from the hypothesized value.\n\nIt's called a t-test because your test statistic (# of standard deviations away from the hypothesized mean) follows a t-distribution.\n\nBut, these are all just wooooords. Let's do something fun.\n\nLet's say you have measured the weight of a sumo wrestler on 20 consecutive days, and he says he weighs 400 pounds. You want to statistically test that claim. \n\nYou find out that his average weight over those 20 days is 402 pounds. LIAR! HE SAID HE WEIGHED 400 POUNDS.\n\nNow wait a minute.\n\nNormal people probably have some variation around their usual weight on a day-to-day basis (maybe they had a big breakfast or something). Unfortunately, you don't know what that normal day-to-day variation is, so you have to use the day-to-day variation of this sumo wrestler's weight as your estimate of that variation (that's why you're using a t-test instead of a z-test -- if you knew the population variance, you could use the z-test).\n\nLet's say the standard deviation of his weight over those 20 days was 1 pound (I'm going to assume you know how to calculate standard deviation.)\n\nIn that case, the t-stat is 2 (402 - 400)/(1). And, the degrees of freedom (don't worry about what this means for now) is 19 (number of tests minus one).\n\nSo, you go to Wolfram Alpha and plug those number in, and you find this: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=t+score+%3D+2+degrees+of+freedom+19.\n\nSee where it says two-sided p-value: 0.06? That means (in 5-year-old language) that there's only a 6% chance that your hypothesis (t-value = 0, or weight = 400) is correct. So, the sumo wrestler is PROBABLY lying. But, you can't know for sure.\n\nEDIT: Note that I've used a lot of statistical language in here that I'm hoping you'll know. If you don't know some of it, feel free to ask."},

Maybe you guys can give me a better understanding so I can rationalize with him?","answer":"The big thing about the FEMA camps is that the government has constructed the to relocate people in the style of WWII internment camps.\n\nThe only true part about that is that they were constructed to relocate people.  The people who live in these camps are displaced from disasters, namely hurricanes like Katrina and Rita.  When these camps were constructed they were designed to be temporary locations that provided housing to the refugees.  All of these areas were intended to only exist for a few years MAX while flood waters receded, homes were rebuilt, utilities brought back on line, etc.  However, by the time those damaged areas were restored, many of the people in the FEMA camps **refused to leave.**  \n\nThe logic behind their refusal to leave the FEMA camps was simple: They had just spent the past 3 years or so building lives and relationships to the communities in the FEMA camps, they did not want to uproot themselves and their lives all over again (keep in mind that while they may have had a house to return to, it wasn't the same home that they had built).\n\nThis covers existing FEMA \"camps\" (that are basically towns now) that people still occupy.\n\nAny of the new camp locations that are empty currently are basically standby zones for refugees to be sent to when they are displaced from their homes in the future.\n\nsource: My father and I have both worked for FEMA.\n\nedit:  Also, just give it up on trying to convince your boyfriend out of a conspiracy theory.  The only way he will change his mind on it is if he uncovers a different point of view on his own.  Anything you say or do will likely just make it worse.

{"title":"ELI5:  Where a culture's standards of beauty come from","question_detail":"This has always bugged me.  Is there a more commonly accepted explanation for why one person's body and personality are more attractive in one place than another?","answer":"In line with what Mason said, standards of beauty often depend on cultural definitions of health. The weight example is a good one. Also, in countries like in East Asia, being pale is more desirable than being tan. This is because historically, countries like China were mostly peasant farmers making a living under the sun; if you were pale, it meant your family could afford not to send you into the fields, which indicates a higher social class. \n\nSimilarly, personality traits are valued differently depending on the area you're in: in a country like Japan, speaking out against immorality is not as valued as being loyal to your company. That's why you see companies in Japan that are corrupt at the top levels, but nobody says anything because a person who places higher priority on loyalty to the company is an attractive spouse. Speaking out against your company is viewed as selfish, even if it's to point out corrupt practises. \n\nEdit for paragraphs."},

{"title":"ELI5: What's the difference between nominal GDP and purchasing power parity GDP? ","answer":"Purchasing Power Parity means you adjust for cost of living.  In many Third World countries, the cost of living is much lower than in the US or Europe.  The cost of food, housing, clothing, and most services can be a tiny fraction of what those things cost in the US or Europe.  Only goods and services that are comparable would have the same cost, like a DVD player.\n\nSo focusing only on the actual amount of money people are paid doesn't really tell you that much about what their lives are like.  If the nominal GDP per capita in a country is $2000, that sounds horribly poor, but the cost of living might be 25% of what it is in the US, so it is really like the people have an average income of $8000, which is actually a fairly decent living standard and far from extreme poverty.\n\nHowever, if you want to know a country's actual economic significance in global terms, you have to look at nominal GDP.  The fact that you can buy lunch from a street stall for 20 cents doesn't affect how many barrels of oil a country can import."},

As new people are born everyday, and there are people of every age at any given time in a country, how/who decides which generation they are placed in?","answer":"Marketers, mainly. Most of the time, you get a steady drip-drip-drip of people being born every year; there's about as many 7 year olds as 5 year olds or 9 year olds or whatever. \n\nBut the World Wars, particularly WWII, fucked that up: All over the world, the young people who would normally be getting married and having their first kids weren't, because the young guys were in the army and times were tough, so even people who were married put off having kids if they could. Then the war ends and all of a sudden you had like 6 years worth of kids being born at once. That changes things up: You have to build bigger schools, bigger toy stores, more cribs and braces and so forth all at once. That forced the people who sell stuff to pay particular attention to what was going on with young people, because they knew that in, say, a couple year's time there was going to be 6x the normal demand for bicycles or prom dresses or whatever. So they started doing more advertising aimed at young people, more TV shows and movies and books specifically aimed at young people and so on, all through the years. Young people are pretty much always rebellious in their late teens early 20s; but when you have six times the normal number of them at once all that rebellious energy can cause much more profound changes in society than it normally does. Viola: The 60s.\n\nSo it wasn't until the baby boom came around that people really started paying attention to the idea of generations as an important thing. \n\nBy the time the boomer wave was passing into adulthood marketers were used to this idea that people the same age as each other have the same types of ideas and desires, and that those desires are different from those of their parents and so they know they'll have to adapt themselves. (Technological change helps too.)

Psychopaths have been referred to as \"intra species predators\". \n\nAs with all personality disorders, we aren't a exactly sure what \"causes\" the disorder. The disorder is marked by an inability to experience emotion (happy, sad) as well as a complete and total lack of empathy (understanding how someone else feels). One of the most popular theories on the behavior is inactive mirror neurons, or the neurons that allow us to experience something someone else is feeling. \n\nPsychopaths are almost impossible to spot. One facet of the disorder is their extreme talent at imitation. They can \"act\" happy, sad, angry, distressed, or frightened, but these aren't genuine emotions. They are pretend. Therefore it's difficult to pin one down. However, some of the DSM criteria that help us spot them are: history of childhood delinquency, heavy drug use, constant lying to the point of illegality, frequent deception in terms of scamming, frequent use of physical intimidation, as well as deliberate and frequent risky sexual behavior. \n\nAs for sociopaths vs psychopaths, the general understanding is psychopaths are born, sociopaths are made.

{"title":"Enriched vs Depleted Uranium and War","question_detail":"Earlier this month was the anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing, in which a highly-enriched Uranium atomic bomb was used in war. Fast forward to modern day, military weapons feature depleted Uranium.  \n\nGiven the understanding that nuclear warfare is not something we want on this planet, why is one version of uranium allowed to be used and not the other? Furthermore, are there large differences in effect; both short term and long term.  \n\nEdit: If you could explain the technical differences in a simple manner I'd think you were pretty cool. ","answer":"There are two main kinds of uranium.\n\nU-235 is the good stuff...it can be used in nuclear reactors and bombs.\n\nU-238 is less useful, but naturally occurring uranium is 99.3% U-238 and 0.7% U-235.\n\nSo in order to make use of uranium, you have to *enrich* it...remove the U-238 so you have a higher concentration of U-235.  This is very difficult, but where you are done, you have one pile of U-235 enriched uranium, and one pile of U-235 *depleted* uranium.\n\nDeplete uranium isn't good for much...but it is not terribly radioactive, and it is very, very heavy...heavier than lead.

{"title":"ELI5: An author's syntax","question_detail":"What syntax means? Types of syntaxes? How to tell what syntax an author uses.","answer":"Syntax is the word order in a sentence. English, unlike many languages, generally has a fairly rigid word order: A subject is followed by a verb, which may be followed by a direct object. Adjectives usually come between the nouns they modify. And so on...\n\nOften you will hear the term \"inverted syntax.\" This is when an author places words out of order in a sentence to emphasis a point. This is very common in poetry, in which inverting the syntax may also help a line fit the meter (pattern of sounds in the poem). Besides this, as far as I know there aren't distinct \"types\" of syntax: The important thing is to recognize when the syntax in a work differs from the standard word order of English. \n\nHope this helps."},
{"title":"ELI5: Hedge funds","question_detail":"How exactly does a hedge fund make money? What is the process of hedging?","answer":"Hedge funds mostly don't engage in \"hedging\".  They are two different things.\n\nHedging is when you make a big investment in something, but then make a small offsetting investment in something that is likely to have the opposite result to your big investment.  If you make a big investment in airline stocks, and you know that airlines' profits depend greatly on the price of fuel being low, you might also make a small investment in oil companies.  That way, if the price of fuel rises a lot, and your airline stocks tank, you won't get totally wiped out, since your oil stocks will do well.\n\nHedge funds each have different strategies, which they mostly don't have to reveal in much detail.  Many of them engage in high-frequency trading.  Some of them make very high risk investments in securities that most investors would avoid - in the housing bubble they bought a lot of the riskiest mortgage-backed bonds.  The hedge fund's management team usually gets paid \"2 and 20\" - 2% of the hedge fund's assets, and 20% of its profits.  So for a $1 billion hedge fund making a $100 million profit, the management team would get $20 million from assets and $20 million from profits, for a total of $40 million."},

{"title":"The Obama birth certificate controversy. What happened and why","answer":"Obama runs for President.  The idea that a black man could be elected President within a generation of Civil Rights seemed impossible to many people.  So imagine their asses clenching when he destroys 365-173.\n\nSo now that he WON, they need to think of some reason his victory might be illegitimate.  This is what they came up with.  Citizenship has NEVER been a central issue of any white Presidential candidate in US history regardless of party.  The US has a long history of trying to marginalize minorities, especially in this EXACT way; by requiring they somehow satisfy a higher standard of proof to legitimize themselves.  Why is this suddenly an issue with Obama?  Oh, but don't call it racism or you'll be accused of \"playing the race card.\"\n\nBut Obama does it anyway.  Releases his [Birth Certificate](http://www.csmonitor.com/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/images/0513-obama-birth-certificate.jpg/7887347-1-eng-US/0513-Obama-birth-certificate.jpg_full_600.jpg).  Situation finished, right?  **WRONG**.\n\nThen people complain that is NOT his \"Birth Certificate\" but rather \"Certificate of Live Birth\" (you can't make this shit up).  The conspiracies flare up again.  It was FORGED, it was ALTERED.  His father's race would have been listed as \"Negro\" not \"African\" in 1961.\n\nKeep in mind here, his Certificate of Live Birth that was released is sufficient enough for the US State Department to issue you a US Passport.  Pretty sure it's even evidence enough to apply for Security Clearance.  The \"Long Form,\" as it was called is locked up in records in Hawaii where Obama was born.\n\nSo the head of the Department of Health of Hawaii comes out and says he had PERSONALLY looked at Obama's long Birth Certificate and that it is there, and legitimate.  **STILL NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM**.\n\nSo round and round we go about the \"long form\" certificate.  We later find out he's having to deal with this nonsense while dealing with Bin Laden raid.  But eventually [the long form is released](http://www.snopes.com/politics/graphics/longform.jpg).\n\n...and then the conspiracy nuts start all over again."},

This effect is called motion parallax. Speed is most easily judged by what we can see, so during the day, you can see things far away \"moving\" slowly.

So this tricks your brain into thinking you're going faster.\n\nThere may be other factors involved, but that's the best answer I've managed to find."},
{"title":"ELI5: Charging stuff with solar","question_detail":"Here's my question:\n\nLet's say I have an electric scooter, a Vespa or something. \nIf the electric Vespa is 1,000 watts and 32V or something like that, do I need a 1,000 watt solar panel if I wanted to charge it via solar? \n\nDo the watts and volts need to match? If they don't will it take significantly longer to charge?","answer":"1000W is probably the power usage of the scooter at its maximum. It won't always use that much power.  (Watts = Volts * Amps .) But the relevant thing is that you need to find out the *capacity* of the scooter's *battery*, not how fast the scooter uses the battery power up. \n \nThe battery in the scooter is going to be rated in terms of its total energy, in something like Watt-hours. For example, if it is a 2000 W-h battery, you could ride it at full speed (1000W) for 2 hours. \n  \nTo charge the 32V battery, you need to provide it with a 32V supply (or slightly higher). You don't need to charge it at the same power level (Watts) that you discharged it at. But assuming the battery is a 2000W-h battery (and it has been fully drained), then\n  \n2000 W-h / 32V = 62.5 Ampere-hours .     \n  \nSo if your solar cell can provide 62.5 Amps at 32 Volts then the battery can recharge in 1 hour. But your solar panel probably can't do that.  If it can supply 6.25 Amps at 32 Volts, then the battery will recharge in 10 hours.  If it can only provide 0.625 A @ 32 V, then it will take 100 hours.   \n  \nIf your solar panel won't output at 32 V (it probably won't) you are going to need a DC-DC converter to \"step up\" the voltage.

{"title":"ELI5: What exactly is the Riemann hypothesis?","answer":"There's a certain game you can play with numbers. You start with two of them (one is called real, and the other is called imaginary), and then you use some complicated rules to find a third number. The rules are hard, though, because they tell you to keep going on and on forever- to find that third number, you have to use math to figure out where the rules are going to end up.\n\nThe man who made up this particular game was called Riemann. He guessed, but couldn't quite prove, that the only way you could end up with zero for the third number was if the \"real\" part of your starting numbers was one half. One of the things Riemann *could* prove, though, was that, *if* the only way you could end up with zero for the third number was by starting with one half as the real part of your starting numbers, then there was an easy way of finding out how many prime numbers there are before a certain point. And that would solve a problem that mathematicians have been wondering about for a long time."},
{"title":"ELI5: Watergate Scandal","answer":"In 1972, a man named Richard Nixon was president. There was an election coming that year, and Nixon was afraid he might lose, so he wanted to know what the other side was up to. But the way he tried to find out was against the law.\n\nHe sent people to sneak into the other side's office (it was in a building called the Watergate, which the story is named for) and hide machines that would let Nixon listen to their phone calls. (Nixon had a habit of recording everything he did on tapes- this will be important later.) But the people he sent got caught, and the police started to find out what they were doing.\n\nFor about a year, the police and reporters from newspapers found out more and more about who had sent them men to break into the office. People were very angry, and the members of Congress were getting ready to *impeach* Nixon, which means that they were going to take away being president because he had committed crimes. They told Nixon to give them all the tapes he had made, but when they listened to them, there were parts missing. Many people thought that Nixon had kept back the parts of the tape that showed him sending the men to break into his enemy's office, but no-one could quite prove it.\n\nOne day, Nixon decided to fire the lawyer who was in charge of finding out who sent to men. He could do that because the President is in charge of that kind of lawyer. But many of the other lawyers who worked for the President thought this was unfair- he was just doing his job. So lots of important people quit their jobs, because they didn't want to work for a man who would fire someone for no reason. In the end, the whole thing just made it look like Nixon was hiding something.\n\nNixon knew that sooner or later, he would be impeached, and everyone would learn about what he had done. He decided to *resign* from being president (that means quit) so that the people in Congress wouldn't bother to tell everyone what he had done, since they had already gotten rid of him.\n\nSince there was no Vice President at the time (he had resigned earlier that year for the same kind of reason), the leader of the House of Representatives, a man named Gerald Ford, became President. One of the first things Ford did was to *pardon* Nixon (that means forgive) for any crimes he might have committed while he was President."},

How do our \"clocks\" compare with other animals'?","answer":"There is a ~25 hour \"circadian rhythm\", which can be 're-synchronized' with the 24-hour clock as long as you're aware of the time of day. As a result your body's own biochemical cycles can closely follow the change of day into night and even the period of the day, so if you need to wake up at a certain time persumably your brain translates that somehow into something your body's doing at approximately that time, and can wake you up as needed.\n\nAll this can (not *is*, but just *can*) be thrown off if you sleep irregularly, or demand of yourself too little sleep before the next wake time. For example, there's no way I can go to sleep at like 4 AM and really wake up at 6. I invariably find I wake up at 7 or 8. But if I go to bed around midnight or earlier, I have no problem waking up nice and early. :)\n\nAll the above is not backed by rigorous scientific study, so if anyone has journal articles on the subject feel free to back me up or shoot me down."},

{"title":"ELI5: How does coloring black and white pictures work and how do you know which colors to use?","answer":"If you mean \"how do you change an image to greyscale\"...\n\nColor has three \"dimensions\". Hue, saturation, brightness.\n\nHue is the \"color family\". and it goes in a circle: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, and back to red. (These value are continuous, so there are blue-greens, blue-blue-greens, and anything in between).\n\nSaturation is the colorfulness (as opposed to the greyness) of the color. Low-saturation means the color looks dull or grey. High-saturation means vivid. Every time you look at a color wheel like [this one](http://www.tigercolor.com/color-lab/color-theory/images/color-wheel-300.gif), the colors are displayed at the highest levels of saturation\n\nBrightness is how light the color is. This is different than saturation, though. Low-brightness colors look black. High-brightness colors look white.\n\nTo make an image to greyscale on a computer, you just set all the saturation to as low as possible. (At this point, the hue actually doesn't even matter, either). In other words, greyscale images are *only* concerned with the brightness of the image.\n\nIn art, brightness is usually known by another name: value. With a pencil, for example, how hard you press against the paper (and how hard or soft the pencil itself is) determines the value. (Other techniques, such as cross-hatching can affect value as well).\n\nIdeally, a black and white image can be made by only using mixtures of black and white. (All pure mixtures of black and white turn out some shade of grey). "},
{"title":"ELI5: Plutonium (Nuclear?) Power, specifically in the Curiosity rover","question_detail":"I was reading [this article](http://rt.com/news/space-curiosity-laser-mars-137/) and it mentioned that Curiosity's laser uses \"...more than a million watts of power in a five-billionth-of-a-second burst...\" and gets its power from a plutonium reactor. How does this work?\n\nI've been searching for an answer in earlier ELI5 posts, and nuclear power seems to be harnessing the energy to heat water and spin a turbine. Is this how Curiosity's reactor works? How can such a small system produce so much power?","answer":"&gt; I've been searching for an answer in earlier ELI5 posts, and nuclear power seems to be harnessing the energy to heat water and spin a turbine. Is this how Curiosity's reactor works?\n\nThe reactor on Curiosity converts a heat differential directly into electricity. As the radioisotope decays, it generates heat, which makes the inner chamber warmer than the outside chamber. This temperature differential is used to generate electricity directly, without the use of water and turbines. The phenomenon is called the [Seebeck effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peltier_effect#Seebeck_effect), although it is way beyond an ELI5 level.\n\n&gt; How can such a small system produce so much power?\n\nIt doesn't produce that much power - only about 110 W. The generator is used to slowly charge the battery, so when it's time to use a power-intensive instrument, there is an excess of charge available.\n\nKeep in mind that when it says \"more than a million watts of power in five-billionth-of-a-second burst,\" that is a _really really short burst_. Power is a term used to describe energy over some time, and you can obtain a very high _power_ by shortening the duration to a very small number, even if you keep energy constant.\n\nTo put it in perspective, a million watts of power over five nanoseconds only has 0.005 Joules of energy.

His political ideology is quite frankly to out there for him to have a realistic shot at getting on the ticket with any party other than the Libertarian Party and he knows that there's no way he could ever be elected as a Libertarian candidate.\n\nFrom what I understand what happened was that Paul thought he could backdoor his way into the the nomination by courting delegates from some candidates who had already been effectively knocked out of contention and had conceded. When a candidate removes themselves from the race there are different rules depending on the state about what happens to the delegates. Some states I think require the delegates to vote the way the former candidate directs them to, some states they're just fair game, and I'm sure other states have other rules. From what I understand, Paul was trying to convince some of the fair game delegates to come into his camp. \n\nThe rule change basically said that delegates were now bound to the way the state voted, rather than being able to vote their preference. \n\nBasically Ron Paul knew that he couldn't win in a popular vote so he was trying to exploit technicalities that would get him delegates that he wouldn't have otherwise gotten. The Republican Party got rid of the loopholes that allowed for those technicalities and Ron Paul supporters are upset because they can't try to gain the system to get a candidate that has no real shot at winning either a primary or a general election.\n\nUltimately the rules for the convention are up to the party, and there wasn't really anything illegal about it. If anything what Paul was doing was equally, if not more shady.\n\nOnce again though, I want to stress that it was highly unlikely that Paul would have ever gotten the nomination anyway."},
{"title":"How did the chiropractors/quacks thing get started?","answer":"Here is an excerpt from the wiki article on [chiropractic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiropractic):\n\nEarly chiropractors believed that all disease was caused by interruptions in the flow of innate intelligence, a vital nervous energy or life force that represented God's presence in man; chiropractic leaders often invoked religious imagery and moral traditions. D.D. and B.J. both seriously considered declaring chiropractic a religion, which might have provided legal protection under the U.S. constitution, but decided against it partly to avoid confusion with Christian Science. Early chiropractors also tapped into the Populist movement, emphasizing craft, hard work, competition, and advertisement, aligning themselves with the common man against intellectuals and trusts, among which they included the American Medical Association (AMA)."},

{"title":"ELI5: The american voting system","question_detail":"I'm german and I don't get it.","answer":"The United States was started by the original 13 states.  Up to 1776 those had been formally separate British colonies, each with its own local government; independence did not form that.  In 1787 delegates from each of the 13 states gathered to write a constitution to spell out how to govern the whole country.\n\nThe most important thing to understand here is that the Constitution needed to be approved by all 13 states.  So the convention had to come up with something that none of the states would reject.  And the two most important effect of this were:\n\n* To gain the approval of the smaller, less populous states, the Constitution ended up giving them nearly as much power as the larger ones.\n* To gain the approval of states that had a large slave population, the Constitution ended up giving them nearly as much power as non-slave states with similar population.  This is the infamous [\"a slave counts as three-fifths of a man\" clause from the original Constitution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-fifths_compromise) (which was revoked later).\n\nWhy is this important?  Because the US electoral system and the composition and functioning of US Congress reflects this:\n\n* The President is not elected directly by the people; formally, it's the states that elect the President.  Each state gets a number of *electoral votes* that partially depends on its population, except that the smallest states are guaranteed at least three votes.  While each state holds its own popular election for President, what that election decides is how the state is going to cast its electoral votes.  And each state casts all of its electoral votes for the same candidateâif a candidate wins Florida 50.5% to 49.5%, Florida gives all 29 of its electoral votes to that candidate, not 15 to the winner and 14 to the loser.\n* Congress is split into the House and the Senate, and laws need to be approved by both.  The House has proportional representation (more representatives for the larger states), but the Senate has two senators per state.\n\nSo the situation is basically like this: California has 37.7 million people and 55 electoral votes, which is 1.46 electoral votes per million people.  Wyoming has 568 thousand people and 3 electoral votes, which is 5.28 electoral votes per million people.  When a Republican in Wyoming votes for Romney, his voice counts about 3.6 times as much as when a Democrat in California votes for Obama."},

It looks like the most suggested solutions are parallels, but how do programs like the ones in the title and other ones I've been seeing, like crossover, actually work? Why do people warn that these programs will make my computer run slowly? Also, more importantly, how exactly do I use them? Do I just install them and then install the program I want to use and somehow it'll recognize it? All the websites and explanations seem really jargon-y, and I know fairly little about computers, so I was hoping you could all help me out. Thanks!","answer":"It isn't quite clear what you're asking.\n\n[Parallels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallels_Desktop_for_Mac) is a virtualisation tool. You can use it to boot an operating system as a program within OSX, so you get an entire desktop in a normal program window. You can then run that operating system's programs with a minor, but generally not important efficiency loss.\n\n[Crossover](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrossOver) is a compatibility layer for windows programs. It allows you to run a windows program and have its windows code automatically translated in real time to the OSX equivalents instead, allowing it to run. It works very well for some programs, but may not work at all for others. It is a proprietary and paid version of the [wine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_compatibility_layer) compatibility layer, so you may as well try wine first since it's free and just as good for most stuff.\n\nXQuartz is apple's implementation of the X graphics server. It doesn't really advance your problem, other than that it allows you to run linux software (such as wine, possibly, unless it has an OSX version) that has a gui. You already have xquartz.\n\n&gt; Why do people warn that these programs will make my computer run slowly?\n\nNeither of these things will magically make your computer slower. However, as with anything, heavy use will do so. Running a virtual machine in parallels may require a fair amount of memory and processor time, as you're running an entire operating system in addition to your normal one, though a modern mac should have plenty of resources available if you don't want to do anything too intensive. Also, programs run in wine are generally (though not always) less efficient and a little slower than in windows, but often not enough to be noticeable.\n\n&gt; Do I just install them and then install the program I want to use\n\nIn the case of wine or crossover, this is more or less the case, though installing them may itself be fiddly, and I'll stress that they don't always work. Frankly, given the complexity of the task it's astounding that they work at all. And they don't just work, they give extremely good performance in many cases.\n\nYou can search [winehq](http://www.winehq.org/) for information on how well different programs may be expected to work, along with information on making any fiddly bits run properly."},

(ELI5: you can hardly tell the direction a sound is coming from, while for light we have eyes that can see very small details). This means that in our ears, sounds tend to get mixed up, while images of different objects are very well separated. So we must make up for this problem, and learn to separate better what has been mixed up.\n\nMany reasons why our brain has become VERY specialized in separating different sounds when they are mixed together.\n\nOur sight, on the other hand, is not as good in separating two mixed colors.

Lets image we have a black box and a blue box. Both boxes have some arrangement of batteries in them and the boxes weigh about the same. We hook up a light to the blue box and the light stays on for the entire day. \n\nAfter the light goes out we hook a light up to the black box. This light stays on for an entire *year*. This means the energy density of the black box is much much higher than the energy density of the black box. Even given that the blue box is cheaper to make, it just isn't nearly as useful as the black box. \n\naccording to [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_air_energy_storage#Energy_density_and_efficiency) wikipedia page, the absolute maximum energy density of compressed air is 100 kJ/kg. According to [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density#Common_energy_densities) wikipedia page, the energy density of gasoline is 47.2 MJ/kg. \n\nBut wait (you might say) isn't 100 *more* than 47.2? Well yes, but I also measured the compressed air number in kilojoules while the gasoline was in megajoules. in the same units they would be 100 kJ/kg and 47,200 kJ/kg respectively. This difference is on the same order of magnitude as the blue box vs black box in the above example.\n\nedit: also, [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_air_car#Disadvantages) are the disadvantages of compressed air cars.

So they force ESPN to not show the game within a certain radius of where the game is being played, so that way people who reasonably could come to the games have to come to the games. \n\nFor MLB and I believe the NHL, the blackout depends on local stations and carriers getting priority over ESPN. So if a local network wants to broadcast a game, they would get automatic priority over ESPN and ESPN would be blacked out in that area so that people would watch the game on the local channel. "},

If the cold water was predominately travelling in a different direction from the warm water, it will form an under water current that travels in a different direction from the surface.\n\nAn example of this is the North Atlantic.  Water at the equator is warmer due to more exposure to the sun.  As it expands, some of it travels north, where it begins to cool off.  Once it reaches the area around Iceland and the North Sea, it is cooled and forced to the bottom, where it flows back out to the Atlantic and back to the equator, where it warms up again.\n\nIncidentally, the increased melting of the glaciers in Greenland and the arctic has begun to disrupt this particular cycle, changing how heat is distributed around the entire North Atlantic and Europe, disrupting the climate of the region."},

What would happen if they shipped only the components needed for one unit of a product, and you had to ask them to ship them again every time you finished a unit (bearing in mind that takes you very little time and you do it frequently)? It'd be ridiculously slow and inefficient. So instead they ship enough components for loads of units. \n\nNow let's say there are 6 stages to building a product. Between these 6 stages, you're storing a lot of stuff temporarily, but you'll melt it down or it'll become part of the final product. It wouldn't make sense to use your upstream provider's storage space, would it? You'd use your own. \n\nIn this analogy, the upstream provider is the CPU, the components are things such as textures for games, your factory is the graphics card, your storage space is dedicated video RAM and the stages are the various copies of, for example, a 3D scene rendering that are used to create the final image.

{"title":"ELI5: What auditing the FED will actually do.","question_detail":"Also, if Ron Paul's ends the fed, doesn't that mean he ends the job he's trying to get?","answer":"The FED is a nickname for The Federal Reserve.  The Federal Reserve is responsible for the monetary policy of the United States.  That means they control how much new money is printed.  Newly printed money takes away value from money that already exists.  (That's why we have inflation, and why prices on everything go up from year to year).\n\nAuditing the Federal Reserve means going through all of their records to figure out how much money they've printed, when they printed it, and who they gave the money to.  Right now, no one else has any of this information.  A partial audit was already performed, and it showed the Fed printed over $16 Trillion (which is larger than the national debt) and gave a lot of it to foreign banks.\n\nRon Paul does not like the Federal Reserve because printing new money out of thin air is actually a way to take money from people who already have dollars.  For example, suppose you estimate that you need $50,000/year to retire and you plan on living another 20 years before you die.  You would need to save up $1 Million before you could retire (20 x $50,000).  But, according to official estimates, we have a 3% rate of inflation.  That means for the first year you'll need $50,000, the second year you'll need $51,546, the third year you'll need $53,140, the fourth year you'll need $54,784.  And so on...  That all assumes the official rate of inflation is true and that the rate of inflation will never change.  Even under these circumstances, it makes it much more difficult to retire or to save up for anything really.  So Ron Paul advocates ending the Federal Reserve system and he offers some alternate ideas that he believes would help prevent inflation (namely, allowing people to use other currencies like Euros or BitCoins or to use some kind of gold-backed currency which cannot be easily created out of thin air).\n\nRon Paul does not appear to want a job at the Federal Reserve.  He did however seek to become President."},
{"title":"ELI5: How/Why do our bodies age?","question_detail":"What exactly happens over the years that causes our bodies to age the way they do?","answer":"Biologists don't actually have a thorough understanding of the aging process. Many suspect that the gradual erosion of [telomeres](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere) might play some role in the aging process. Telomeres are almost certainly present in order to protect gene sequences located near the termini of chromosomes. Human DNA is not circular and is therefore susceptible to DNA degradation enzymes within the body. Certain enzymes digest DNA indiscriminately, but the presence of telomeres is hypothesized to mitigate this digestion. Additionally, the DNA replication process requires unique enzymes to replicate the end-terminal DNA sequences, but each cell replication event shortens the telomeres of our chromosomes. As a result of this shortening process, the genes located near the telomeres gradually become degraded. The idea is that this gene degradation (which obviously requires time to occur) becomes most evident in people who have lived longer.\n\nDNA replication is also an imperfect process, with many mutations occurring in each replicating cell within our body. Most mutations have no serious consequences (and most are repaired), but biologists suspect that the sum total number of mutations accumulated over a lifetime in an organism might lead to significant DNA damage, and consequently, aging (read: [Knudson hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knudson_hypothesis)). Our body has [many mechanisms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_repair#DNA_repair_mechanisms) for preserving the original sense of our DNA, but when mutations occur in the genes that encode the proteins that purge our DNA of these mutations, our cells become susceptible to various diseases. This phenomenon is most obviously responsible for many kinds of cancer.\n\nDNA damage is also incurred by exposure to radiation. One fascinating example of accelerated aging by exposure to radiation from the Sun - widely circulated on the internet recently - is the story of [this trucker](http://www.united-academics.org/magazine/20687/the-aging-effects-of-the-sun-revealed-on-truckers-face/). Because of uneven exposure to the Sun, one side of his face appeared to age more rapidly than the other. We can speculate as to the cause, but biologists know that UV radiation is responsible for many kinds of skin cancer. Experiments have shown that the underlying mechanism involves the excitation of electrons in DNA molecules. These excited electrons form covalent bonds with neighboring nucleotides that can interfere with the DNA replication process, incurring additional damage to the cell's DNA. Organisms have evolved certain mechanisms for protecting against UV radiation, most notably the production of [melanin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanin). However, as with all things in biology, this system is also susceptible to damage in the melanin genes.\n\nThe sum total of all of these effects - all of which are inevitable for any human being - are suspected to make up much of the source of aging.\n\nHope this helped!"},

{"title":"ELI5 : What is martial law?","answer":"I'm going to explain this to an American \"five year old\", some details will need to be changed for citizens of other republics or constitutional monarchies. My explanation will totally fail for five year olds living in dictatorships. \n\n\nRight now we live under a representative government. What this means is that people who make the laws are citizens. We choose, by voting, who gets to make these laws for us. Different people make laws at different levels. A state legislator will make laws that only are good inside one state, and congress will make laws for everyone in the country. However, these people cannot simply give us orders to do something, they have to make a law. If a state legislator, or even a congressman wants to make us do something, he can't just say \"go clean your room!\" He would have to make a law saying everyone's room must be clean. What's more, once he makes the law' it is someone else's job to see that it is done. This person would be the state's governor or the president of the United States. These people use police to help enforce the laws. \n\nDefending us, we have the armed forces: the army, navy and air force. The soldiers, sailors and airmen have their own set of laws, that are much stricter than the ones we have to obey. What's more, higher ranking people can give orders, and lower ranking ones have to obey. If the General says \"go clean your room\" a soldier has to do it, even if there was no law saying that he should. (There are a FEW laws saying what the general can NOT order, however.) \n\nIn martial law, the people in charge of the military, the generals and other officers can give orders to civilians, not just soldiers sailors and airmen. In martial law, you have to obey orders of people who are in command, and they can issue orders at any time, even changing them day to day. \n\nMost of the time our normal system of laws are better. We have more freedom, and we know that some general somewhere isn't going to go nuts and abuse his power to make us do stuff like clean HIS room. However, our normal system works more slowly than martial law. It takes weeks, months, sometimes years to pass a law. If things are really bad, sometimes that takes too long. If we are ever in BIG trouble, congress can declare martial law, and give the command over to the generals who can work much more quickly to get things done. \n\nIn some other countries, the generals take over by ordering their soldiers to attack or threaten the people making the normal laws. This is called a coup (pronounced \"coo\"). The generals almost always thereafter set up martial law, with themselves in charge, at least for a while. \n\ntl;dr Under normal law, the congress and state legislatures make the laws, govonors and presidents have police enforce them. Under martial law generals give orders, soldiers see that they are carried out. "},

{"title":"ELI5: What exactly is radiation? ","answer":"There are many types of radiation.\n\nFirst one is electromagnetic radiation, or in other words - light. Even though our eyes can't see it, light in a rainbow goes well beyond violet colours and well over red. Radio waves, microwaves are simply colours over red, they are part of infrared spectrum, while UV rays (the ones that burn your skin if you are too long in the Sun), x-rays and gamma rays are below violet in ultraviolet spectrum. The further you are to the violet rays, the stronger radiation becomes and can burn your skin and give you cancer more easily. The further you are above red, the light is more lazy and can pass through stuff like walls and such without touching them. In other words, infrared goes through matter almost without interacting, while ultraviolet knocks atoms about, displaces parts of DNA and even kills cells while passing through. Gamma radiation, very energetic type of UV spectrum, can be stopped only by lead plates and can very easily kill you.\n\nOther types of radiation are beta particles, these are simply electrons. They can penetrate your skin a bit and make quite a mess, but they are easier to stop and are less harmful than Gamma rays. \n\nLast type of radiation is alpha radiation. These are parts of nucleus flying and knocking other things over. While gamma and beta radiations were like packets of energy that go trough anything, alpha particles are like big, slow cannonballs. They can be harmful if they get inside you, but they are too big and too slow, so your skin, sheet of paper, or even few centimetres of air will stop them.\n\n----\n\nAs for where radiation comes from. Light can be produced from heating stuff, but really energetic one comes when big atoms break up or smaller atoms merge. They either smash each other so much, that heavy atom is formed and some pieces fly off, or get too fat and break into lighter atoms, again generating radiation."},

Or am I just paying them for the servers to host it?\n\nHelp!","answer":"You remember going to the library and using the card catalog (or computer) and Dewey Decimal System to find a certain book you wanted?\n\nDomain names are kind of like that. Sort of. The servers (books) have a numeric address that computers read easily. Domain names are the way we find servers.\n\nWhen you type in \"reddit.com\" into your browser, first, your computer makes a request to a domain name system server. These DNS servers are the card catalogs that have records of every public domain name on the Internet. The DNS server replies back to your computer saying \"reddit.com is at 184.84.248.40.\" Your computer then knows where that website (or book) is at and can get to it easily.\n\nTo answer your actual question, when you buy a domain name, you are leasing the record of that name in DNS servers for a period of time. You will have the control to tell DNS servers \"domain X points at this address.\"\n\nDomain registrars don't own the right to not-yet-created domain names. Nobody does. There's just no record of that domain yet.\n\nIf you purchase a domain name from one place (let's say GoDaddy), then purchase web server hosting at another (let's say HostGator), you can go to the GoDaddy website and tell it to point at the HostGator server. There are some extra steps on the HostGator side to get it all to work right. \n\nThere should be enough documentation to walk you through everything, and if that doesn't work, hosts do have methods of support for this exact situation.\n\nSpeaking from experience, I only used GoDaddy and HostGator as examples as they were the first to come to mind while I wrote this. There are many other hosts and domain registrars out there. I personally don't touch GoDaddy. Last I used it, their website was not easy to use and navigate. I really do recommend HostGator for both buying domain names and hosting. They're just so much easier to deal with."},

{"title":"ELI5: endocytosis and exocytosis. ","answer":"Endocytosis is how cells internalize things.\n\nThese 'things' can vary quite a bit: just the membrane + proteins that are embedded in it and whatever they're binding (receptor mediated endocytosis), large solid particles (phagocytosis), large liquid loads (macropinocytosis).\n\nOnce internalized: early endosomes are the sites of recycling of membrane/receptors back to the membrane. Late endosomes are formed by fusion of early endosomes and vesicles from the golgi that have enzymes that will help break down the cargo. Lysosomes are mature endosomes that are highly acidic and have lots of enzymes that break down the cargo into its component pieces.\n\nExocytosis is how cells export things. It's used to secrete things (signaling molecules, structural proteins for the ECM, enzymes to degrade and modify the cell's surroundings etc) and to add/modify the lipids/proteins on the plasma membrane.\n\nVesicles are trafficked from the golgi apparatus containing the proteins/lipids/etc to be exported to the membrane. The vesicles dock and fuse with the help of SNARE proteins. SNAREs work in pairs, a v-SNARE on the vesicle and a t-SNARE on the target membrane. The SNAREs use energy to mediate the fusion of the membranes. The vesicle membrane (and all the proteins embedded in it) gets incorporated into the plasma membrane and the contents are dumped outside the cell."},

{"title":"Completeness of the Reals","question_detail":"Axiom or theorem ","answer":"Completeness means that if you have a bunch of numbers in a set, then this set has a least upper bound. Least means a \"smallest,\" and \"upper bound\" means a number that is greater than or equal to all the numbers in a set. For example, the following set:\n\n{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nhas a least upper bound of 5. Note that 6 is not a least upper bound because there is a smaller one (5). The following set \n\n{all numbers x such that x &lt; 5}\n\nalso has 5 as an upper bound. As it turns out, this is an extremely useful characteristic to have. So the question is, can we create a set of numbers such that *any* subset that has an upper bound also has a least upper bound? The answer is yes, and it's called the Real Number System.\n\nThe real number system is generally built up \"from scratch\" from the \"counting numbers\" (1, 2, ....) using the Peano axioms and working with the empty set, the set containing the empty set, the set containing the set containing the empty set, etc. to an orderable sequence of \"objects\" which are the counting numbers. The next step is to show that there is no largest number, and then to extend the concept to negative numbers and rational numbers. Rational numbers are numbers of the form p/q where p and q are (possibly negative) \"counting numbers.\" The rational numbers as a collection are denoted Q (for quotient, since the numbers are of the form p/q). Note that a number like 3 is in Q because 3/1 is of the form p/q).\n\nQ is pretty neat. You can add two things in Q and you always get something in Q back. If you have something in Q that's not 0, you can \"flip it over\" and multiply it together to get 1. Note that you can't do it for the counting numbers; there is no number such that 3 times that number would equal 1 in the counting numbers. \n\nThis concept is called \"closed\" for a particular operation. If you add any two numbers or multiply any two numbers together in Q, you get something else in Q. You can also solve things like 3x=8 in Q, which you can't do in the counting numbers.\n\nIt almost seems as if Q is everything you would ever want. But there are problems with Q. There are tiny holes in Q. Allow me to demonstrate:\n\nIf a_0, a_1, a_2 ... are in Q, then:\n\na_0 + a_1 is in Q (a fraction plus a fraction is always another fraction)\n\na_0 + a_1 + a_2 is in Q (a fraction plus a fraction plus a fraction is always another fraction)\n\na_0 + a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n is in Q (continuing the logic from above).\n\nSo far so good. But what if we continue this sum indefinitely?\n\nTake, for instance, this sum:\n\nPi = 3/1 + 1/10 + 4/100 + 1/1000 + 5/10000 + 9/100000 + ...\n\nYou may recognize this as 3.14159... or the digits of Pi. First, does this sum make sense? How do we know it exists? Well clearly a sum like 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + .. doesn't make sense, because it doesn't evaluate to a number. But this term clearly \"tends towards\" a specific number (in this case Pi), so sacrificing a little bit of rigor, we can say that this sum makes sense.\n\nBut Pi is widely known to be irrational. By definition, an irrational number can't be written by p/q. So this infinite sum of numbers in Q gives you a number that's not in Q! You added smaller and smaller and smaller numbers of Q - an infinite number of them actually - and somehow came up with something that's not in Q! So Q has a hole at Pi. In fact, Q has lots of these holes - an infinite number of them - and they can all be \"constructed\" in the same manner.\n\nSo an infinite sum is not closed under Q. What if we were to take all of these infinite sums that aren't in Q, and add them to Q? Well, if you do this, you end up with the real numbers R.\n\nConsider the following set:\n\n{All x such that x &lt; Pi}\n\nIn Q, this does not have a least upper bound. Pi is not in Q as we've established it can't be written as p/q. For any number less than Pi, we can find a number between that number and Pi. Using a picture, if you want to offer 3.1415 as a least upper bound:\n\n|----------------|\n\n3.1415 ^       Pi\n\nWhere the carot can be 3.14159, which is greater than 3.1415 but less than Pi. Convince yourself that no matter how close you get to Pi in Q, you can always find a number between that number and Pi.\n\nHence Q is not complete since there is a set that does not have a least upper bound.\n\nHowever, if we consider {All x such that x &lt; Pi} in R, we have \"constructed\" Pi using the infinite sequence above, and Pi is a least upper bound for the set. In fact, any set written as such will have a least upper bound, so R is said to be complete."},

When the fan is on you lose more heat and that's what you feel. When you sweat the fan helps evaporate water which drains more heat from you.  The fan makes you lose more heat because it sends room temperature air at you at a constant rate to which you can lose heat.

","answer":"1. That's a matter of opinion, but *my* opinion is no. The purpose of voting is to establish a sense of the populace. For example, the person who should be elected mayor of your town is the candidate who has the support of more people than any other candidate. This only works if the people who vote in the mayoral election all actually have meaningful opinions about who should be mayor. If you have no idea who any of the candidates are and vote for the guy with the coolest-sounding name, you're reducing the extent to which the outcome of the balloting will fairly and correctly represent the sense of the populace.\n\n2. Moot.\n\n3. Nothing has happened in the past three-and-a-half years that could *accurately* be described that way, no. Government is hellaciously complex even at the best of times, and government at the national level in a country the size of the United States is even more complex than that. If a representative in Congress chooses to vote \"no\" on such-and-such a bill for reasons of judgment or conscience, somebody's gonna come along and say \"You just voted 'no' to be obstructionist,\" as if legislators were there only to rubber-stamp the political will of the president. That's true regardless of who's in the White House, but it's never ever correct. Edmund Burke said it best: A representative owes not just his industry but his judgment. Meaning it's not automatically obstructionism to vote \"no\" on a bill the president champions. That's part of what being a representative is all about.\n\n4. Moot again.\n\n5. The use of the word \"promise\" there is incredibly misleading. Let's make up a simplistic example: Say I'm a candidate for president, and I think gasoline should retail for $2 a gallon by 2025. I campaign on this: I want gas to be $2 a gallon by 2025, and if elected I'ma gonna try to make that happen. I win the election, and start working with smart people to come up with a set of governmental decisions and programs that will, in the opinions of some experts, lower the price of gas to $2 a gallon. Then I try to persuade members of Congress to sponsor the legislative parts of my plan, and try to persuade other members to vote in favor of it. Then when it passes, I sign it. As long as my plan works, and somebody doesn't come along after I'm done and revert part or all of it, then the price of gas will be $2 a gallon by 2025. Yay me. (Or boo me, if you happen to be in the \"Gas should be more expensive\" camp.)\n\n6. You don't have to.

If I told you to come to my trailer home, there are two things I could do. I could either give you my address or I could drive my trailer home to you. Obviously, moving my whole house is going to be a lot of work and giving my address much easier.\n\nPointers are addresses of memory. Instead of copying the memory everywhere you simply copy the memory's address. This makes things faster and has less overhead. It also is sometimes more intuitive. For example: by passing the address around you only have one of those objects in memory. Hence changes of that state are viewable through the whole program, but leaves the address the same."},

{"title":"ELI5: How does SoundHound work?","answer":"Soundhound (and other similar apps like Shazam) have a large database of music.  Much in the same way google is able to index the internet into a searchable thing, so to is SoundHound able to index this gigantic collection of songs into something that is can be quickly searched.\n\nThey started off with this massive library of music (imagine several hard drives full of mp3's).  They needed to find a way to make this collection searchable, not by title, artist, song, etc., but by the sound of the song itself.  You could either build a server that had enough RAM inside of it to load the entire library, but that would be VERY expensive (most computers have something like 4GB of RAM these days; you would probably need to build a computer with something like 2,500 times that much RAM).  So to reduce this overhead, SoundHound had to break this library of audio down into its basic parts; things about the music you could write down on a piece of paper.  The simple stuff.\n\nSo what kinds of things can we extract from the sound of a song that can help soundhound find the song you're looking for?  Well, in advanced, SoundHound pre-processed all the music in their collection to create a new sort of index that can be searched.  The servers are running some software that can analyse the sounds it's hearing and determine things like:\n\n* The key/scale the song is in\n* The tempo\n* Fundamental notation patterns (what notes are playing and when)\n* Drum beats\n\nPerhaps even more, but those few things are all you really need to know about a song in order to index them into a database that can be searched quickly.\n\nNow, when you press the button that makes SoundHound start listening to some music for you, it's actually streaming audio from your phone over the Internet to SoundHounds servers, where they do the heavy lifting of analyzing that sound, figuring out things like tempo, key, notation patterns, to filter out what doesn't match in their library and find what does.  It's entirely possible for it to be wrong, but as they say.... 90% of the time it works 100% of the time."},

Founded in August 2011, it consists of approximately 12 members who use only nicknames and hide their faces. On February 21, 2012, as part of a protest movement against the re-election of Vladimir Putin, five women from the group entered a Church in Moscow. [This followed (video)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCasuaAczKY). In the song, they invoked the name of the Virgin Mary, and urged her to get rid of Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and to \"become a feminist\". On February 26, a criminal case was opened against the band members which accuses them of hooliganism. They were detained without bail. Three members were convicted and sentenced to two years in a penal colony on August 17, 2012 with the judge calling their act \"crudely undermining social order\". Amnesty International called the conviction âa bitter blow for freedom of expression. So did Reddit."},

(e.g. \"September\"=\"7th month\" in Latin)","question_detail":"I've always heard that it's because Julius Caesar and Caesar Augustus added the months of July and August in the summer, pushing off the other months.  But now that seems stupid and facile to me.\n\nWikipedia's entry on September says that in 46 BC the first of the year switched from March 1 to January 1, which at least does the trick and is also during Julius' reign (he was assassinated two years later) - but why would he move the start of the year? \n\n\n\n","answer":"The original roman calander only had 10 months. This didn't work very well for fairly obvious reasons. In order to make the calendar actually represent a full year, 2 months were added, named after Julius and Augustus (July and August). Thus every month after August is numbered incorrectly.  "},

Is this $900,000 taken from an income of $1million or only taxed up to the 90% of income?","answer":"Typically they mean a 90% *marginal* rate, not a straight 90% tax rate.\n\nThe way taxes work is based on tables.  The tables go something like this:\n\n    On the first $10,000 of your income, pay 0% tax\n    For the next $10,000 of your income, pay 10% tax\n    For the next $50,000 of your income, pay 20% tax\n    Above that, pay 30% tax.\n\nAnd so on and so forth.  Today, the tax rate tops out at 35%.  What that means is, it doesn't matter if you got paid $1 million or $1 billion, the top marginal rate for you is still 35%.

Countries that shared a cultural heritage with the UK and gained their indepedence peacefully wanted to maintain a link with their parent country, and this is what the Commonwealth does.  It was particularly important during the decolonization efforts of the 20th Century, easing the transition to full independence. \n\nFor other countries, like US and Ireland, independence was hard fought and bloody, so they weren't terribly interested in retaining ties.  Also, up until 2007, any Commonwealth country that became a republic had its membership terminated.\n\nMore recently, some countries who were never UK colonies, such as Mozambique and Rwanda, have joined for the political and economic benefits.

{"title":"ELI5 The difference between the Taliban and al-Qaeda ","question_detail":"So I pretty much thought they were essentially the same organization just different monikers.  Then i read a report that the Taliban is breaking off from al-Qaeda to enter peace negotiations/cease-fire with the US.  [Story here for those interested](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-taliban-is-ready-to-negotiate-2012-9).  So what is the differences?  Are they ran by different people with different goals/objectives?","answer":"Talib is the Pashtun word for student. The Taliban evolved from the madrassas (Islamic religious schools) in northwestern Pakistan. They adhere to a strict interpretation of Islam based on returning to a very traditional way of life (Salafism). Many of the Pakistan madrassas were funded by Saudi Arabia, who share the same interpretation of Islam. Most Talib are from the Pashtun tribe, which dominate NW Pakistan and Southern and Eastern Afghanistan.\n\nThe Taliban where founded as a fighting force by the Pakistani Intelligence Service (ISI) as a means of bringing an end to the Afghan Civil War, and to have an Afghan Government favourable to Pakistani interests. The ISI provided weapons and training to the Taliban. Between 1996 to 2001 the Taliban ruled most of Afghanistan as the de-facto government. They received diplomatic recognition from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\n\nAl Qaeda is Arabic for 'the base'. It was originally founded as a militant group to fight the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s. It was, then, mostly composed of Salafist fighters from Saudi Arabia. Many groups fighting the Soviets received weapons and training from the American CIA, although it's never been disclosed if Al Qaeda was among them. \n\nThe founder was a man called Osama Bin Laden, who was the son of a Yemeni builder. Not just any builder though - he built palaces for the Saudi Royal family, making the Bin Laden family one of the richest in Saudi Arabia. Osama himself was due to inherit more than $100million before his family disowned him post 2001. Following the withdrawal of the Soviets in Afghanistan the organisation largely disintigrated - with it's fighters opting to fight in various parts of the world. Bin Laden himself returned to Saudi Arabia. Following the first Gulf War, Bin Laden was forced to leave the country due to the Saudi King's decision to ally with the American forces. He chose Sudan. \n\nAround this time Bin Laden began to form an alliance with an Egyptian organistion called Islamic Jihad (led by  Ayman al-Zawahiri) - which had tried to assassinate Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak and orchestrated a terror campaign of bombings. Both shared a hatred of western-orientated Arab governments and the west in general. This was really an alliance between IJs expertise and Bin Laden's money. Although Bin Laden was the spiritual head, and the banker - al-Zawahiri was the operations chief. \n\nThe group had to leave Sudan in 1996. The recent emergence of the Taliban, who shared al Qaeda's salafism, and Bin Laden's links in the country made it an ideal location for a base of operations. There were, and are very few operational links between the two groups however. "},

Some dialects, like AAVE, can be fairly different than the standard - Standard American English, in this case. SAE is the arbitrarily designated standard and prestige dialect of American English.

He initially offers you all $100 to anyone willing to sell them their share, which you all decline because you feel it's worth more than that. He then offers, $200, then $300, then $1000, then $2000, which one of the part owners Bob accepts, because he needs to fix his car. So the share price is established at $2000. \n\nLater, you see that a Hotdog stand has been been set up in a similar company fashion. The hotdog stand shares are $1500 a share, and are earning $1000pa each. You're unable to get $2000 for your share, but you get $1800, and buy the hotdog stand share for $1500. And still make the same share of profits each year.\n\nMain points:\n\n- There are two ways to make money from shares: Selling shares for more than you bought them for, and recieving your share of the profits(called dividends). \n- The share price is determined by the profits of the company - if the company is performing well and is going give a good dividend, then the share price rises to match it. \n\n\n\n"},

It's for investment and you really like it, but you don't want to pay more than it's worth.  How you figure out how much it's worth is you look at whether it has a solid foundation, good building quality and a good area.  T\n\nAt the auction, you are heavily outbid.  You have no idea why the guy who won the auction bid so much higher than you for it.  You find out later that he knows something you didn't know - that there was a plan for the land to be rezoned, making it worth much more than you thought it was.\n\nNaturally, you'd be pissed off. If you knew this was going to be the case you would have bid more, along with many other bidders.  Worse still, the guy who bought it works for the local government and he's the one who is in charge of rezoning. Two things have happened here:\n\n* The house did not exchange at true market price, since not everyone had an opportunity to bid on its unknown potential.\n\n* The local government worker has a conflict of interest for personal gain.\n\nIt's not that much different with traded securities, except the market for each security is identical (every house is subjectively different) and they exchange hands much much much for quickly and frequently.  Because of this, the very rationale that security markets exist is that whatever price a stock is being traded is an 'expression' of its value, according to all available information and public sentiment.\n\nTo be able to say the price that buyers and sellers on the stock market are negotiating and outbidding each other based on the same information is integral to the confidence that the current price is the market price.\n\nIf investors were no longer confident in the market price, you would have people withdrawing from the markets, jeopardising its 'liquidity'.  That would be like not having enough people at your auction.  The ultimate result is that a market that lacks integrity can pretty much disappear with people trying to get rid of their stocks through a fire sale.

The reason is, at its core, the way a computer represents things is there's a wire somewhere, and there's either current flowing through it or not. It's on or it's off. So if you want to represent a 0, that wire has no current. If you want to represent a 1, you put a little current through. It's not so easy to represent a 2 with that same wire. You could use different levels of current to represent the different numbers, but it's really hard to make sure they're all exactly the right amount, and when you get power fluctuations your numbers would start jumping around. (Not that this hasn't been tried before...there have been ternary computers made in the past.)\n\nSo, how do you represent a two? Well, how about 2 wires? Just like we use different digit places for all the groups of tens, hundreds, etc, you can do the same in binary. Each place, or \"bit\", represents 1's, 2's, 4's, 8's, 16's, etc. And you can make a wire that corresponds to each one. If you have a register comprised of 64 wires, you can represent any 64-bit number by lighting up different wires.\n\nProtip: The reason we use 64 bits is because that also is a power of two, and sometimes you want to refer to something by an address. If you choose a register that has some number of bits that's a power of two, then it's really easy and convenient to describe the location of things (using pointers and addressing)."},
{"title":"ELI5: Plagiarizing","question_detail":"When does it become plagiarizing if you cite sources? If you don't cite? Do you have to reword the information?","answer":"Plagiarizing is when you pass someone else's work off as your own.\n\nCiting sources is a way of making it very clear someone else did this...you are basically shouting \"I'm totally not plagiarizing here!\"\n\nIf you don't cite, it becomes more subjective.  If it is generally known and available information, like \"the population of the earth is 7 billion people\", it's unlikely anyone would confuse that for original research.  But if you present highly detailed numbers on populations projects you got from a UN researcher, it might appears as though it was your own original work, no matter how you reworded it.\n\nSo there are no hard and fast rules.

For instance, Kiefer Sutherland's bacon number is one. This is because he and Kevin Bacon were in a movie together. However, someone like Johnny Depp's bacon number is two. This is because Johnny Depp was in a movie with Helena Carter, and she was in a movie with Kevin Bacon, thus making a two person barrier between Johnny Depp and Kevin Bacon, making the number two.

For example, [here's a quote from a interview with a guy who just wrote a whole big story about Venus and Serena Williams](http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/27/behind-the-cover-story-john-jeremiah-sullivan-on-venus-and-serena-williams/): \n\n\"One thing Venus talked about that was interesting was how easy it is for professional athletes to pick up other sports. So what they are good at is not the sport itself, but itâs just a way of being in the world. Itâs a sense of their own bodies and an ability to manipulate their own bodies and have sort of a visual map in your head of what the different parts are doing. At one point she was talking about doing a benefit with Peyton and Eli Manning. Theyâd almost never played tennis before and they started out awful, and she said it was amazing to watch them.

{"title":"ELI5 - Correlation vs Causation","answer":"Correlation means that two things happen together a lot of the time. Causation means that one thing causes another to happen. You often hear the phrase \"Correlation does not imply causation.\" That means that just because two thing often happen together, it does not mean one thing causes the other.\n\nFor example, I could probably find a correlation between people using umbrellas and increases in car accidents. It would be silly for me to say that umbrella use *causes* car accidents. In this case there is another event that causes both of these things. People use umbrellas when it is raining, and rain makes the roads slippery. Rain is the *cause* of both of these things.\n\nAnother possibility is that the two correlated things are completely unrelated. Did you know that the moon is steadily getting further away from earth? Did you know that the human population has been steadily increasing for thousands of years? Since both have been steadily increasing, it might be possible to show a correlation between them, but in this case they are completely unrelated. The moon getting further from Earth does not cause human population to grow, and growth of the human population does not effect the orbit of the moon. There is no common cause like the example with the rain, either."},

{"title":"ELI5: How batteries work","question_detail":"How do batteries deliver power to electronic devices?","answer":"Sort of like how water flows downhill, electrons have a natural tendency to move to places that don't already have a lot of electrons. It's of course relative, there are electrons orbiting every atom everywhere ever, but in some substances, the electrons are nice and spread out and comfortable (low charge), while in others they are all cramped and jammed in together (high charge).\n\nNow, a battery always contains two substances separated from one another. There's always one that has a lot of electrons, and one that has relatively few electrons. The electrons want to move from the high charge area to the low charge area, but since the two chemicals are separated from one another, they can't.\n\nThat is, however, until you hook a wire up to it! When you put your battery in a device -- whether it's a car battery in your pickup or a double A in your tv remote -- what you're doing is creating a circuit. That is, there is now a path for the electrons to flow from the highly charged negative side of the battery to the lightly charged positive side. And as the electrons zip by, your device is able to use a little bit of their energy to, say, change the channel on your tv. Sort of like how a water wheel uses the flow of the water going by to turn the mill. Except, you know, tiny."},
{"title":"ELI5 - The bits in 32-bit or 64-bit","question_detail":"Reposting because I deleted too fast","answer":"I think some of this is likely to be better for someone older than 5, but I'll write it up anyway. :)\n\nMost of us are used to counting only in the power of 10s.  That means each digit in a number would be multiplied by 10 some number of times based on its position.  So, 5 is 5 * 10^0.  10^0 is just 1.  So, 5 * 10^0=5 * 1=5.  45=(4 * 10^1)+(5 * 10^0).  10^1=10.  So, that is (4*10)+(5*1)=40+5.  This continues for the hundreds place (10^2 or 10*10) and the thousands (10^3 or 10 * 10 * 10), etc.  Each place gets another 10.  That is called decimal or base-10 numeration.\n\nOk, now that you understand how we normally count, let's talk about binary because computers use binary numbers instead of decimal.  Binary works the same except instead of each digit being a number from 0-9, it is only 0 or 1.  So, the first digit would be multiplied by 2^0, the second by 2^1, the third by 2^2 and so on.  So the number 1010 in binary would be (1 * 2^3)+(0 * 2^2)+(1 * 2^1)+(0 * 2^0).  2^3=2 * 2 * 2=8, 2^2=2 * 2=4, 2^1=2 and 2^0=1.  So, 1010=(1*8)+(0*4)+(1*2)+(0*1)=8+2=10.  To count from 0 to 10 in binary would be: 0000,0001,0010,0011,0100,0101,0110,0111,1000,1001,1010\n\nOk, now that you understand binary... I hope.  Let's talk about how it applies to computers.  Like I mentioned above, computers use binary instead of decimal numbers.  Each digit of the number is called a bit (for some reason that I don't know).  A 32 bit number is a binary number 32 digits long.  That is 00000000000000000000000000000000 through 11111111111111111111111111111111 or 0 through 4,294,967,295.  Computers use these numbers as locations for things that they are working on.  The bigger the number, the more things they can keep track of.  So, a 32-bit computer can keep track of 4,294,967,296 (including 0) things at once.  A 64-bit computer can keep track of 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 things at once.  As you can see, it is a much larger number so a 64-bit computer can work on many more things or much larger data at once.\n\n\nELI5: Each bit is a digit in a number for a computer.  32-bits is a 32 digit number and 64-bits is a 64-digit number for a computer.  Computers use these bits as places to store things (data, programs, etc) when they are running.  Think of a bit as a number on a pocket.  The more bits you have, the more pockets you have.  The more pockets you have, the more things you can carry on you at once.  \n\nEDIT: fixed number for 32-bit integer"},

{"title":"ELI5, how does the government work in china work and how is it different from the US? ","question_detail":"I know that it is classed as communist but I know it's not the same as the USSR was. So how does it work? ","answer":"For China, it is a centrally planned economy.\n\nThe communist party is the only party, and though they are 'communist', their position on communist principles has changed dramatically since the 70s. They have adopted very much a hybrid, with increasingly more market instruments, which they would argue preserves the benefits of both systems.\n\nThey have a national people's congress, with each member representing their constituency. But being a billion people, there are thousands of them. You can see hilariously ridiculous group pictures of them as they fit everyone in. It's impractical for them to meet on every law, so they only meet on a few occasions a year. For most day to day issues they have a standing committee that represents the congress (like delegated power squared).\n\nBeing centrally planned, every 5 years, the government comes up with a 5 year plan to target what they want to achieve. This is very common of communist governments. A lot is aspirational, but includes some specific plans. The point if this is to both unify efforts and signal to its economy some kind of certainty. They generally have a good record of sticking to their plans, but like any politician they often justify why they didn't.\n\nThe other important points are the government owns a lot of the businesses in China. As a result, companies like sinopec not only pursue profit, but also political goals like energy security. Same goes with their export companies and a whole array of businesses. They also get a lot of preferential treatment over privately owned companies.\n\nChina also has special economic zones, which are more 'capitalist' than other areas in china. They have more business friendly laws and encourage a market economy. These areas are mainly coastal, and remember how I said china has been transforming for a while now? This has all got to do with Deng Xiaopeng who led China in the 60s (i think) and wanted to modernize china with the philosophy that some regions will get rich, the rest of china will follow. Not very communistic at all, I would say. But it is a major reason for the rise of China.\n\nSo amidst all this, you can see china is a bit of a hybrid. They recognise what markets can do, but also look at them with some suspicion. Maybe a lot of suspicion. They've had private property formalized fairly recently so it's all something of an experiment with phasing in liberal western ideology \"well...they kind of had this before the communists took over\". \n\nI think it reflects in many ways the Chinese mentality of being very materialistic, industrious, business minded people, but also a strong sense of family and community (the \"greater good\"). On the scale of governing a billion and half people, this translates into the merging politics and business, and Chinese nationalism."},

{"title":"ELI5: Creation of the universe?","question_detail":"Just wanted to ask how the universe was created and what the big bang is (in the science version, of course, not the creationism one).\nThanks Reddit!","answer":"Based upon extrapolations of how the universe is behaving now and telescopes picking up information coming from so far away that it is literally billions of years old, scientists have come to the conclusion that all matter and energy in the universe was once contained at a single point, commonly called a singularity.  The nature of this singularity is basically unknown as there is no way to gather information from any point earlier than after the universe started expanding away from this point.\n\nIn this moment in time, all matter in the universe existed only as subatomic particles, the particles that make up the the particles that make up an atom (that isn't a typo).  An atom is made up of Protons, Neutrons, and Electrons, and these are made up various other particles known as Quarks, Leptons, and Bosons (which includes the recently verified Higgs Boson).  In the first few moments after the Big Band, these particles cooled enough to group into the Protons, Neutrons, and Electrons.  These particles formed the bonds that created the first hydrogen atoms.\n\nEventually, minor variations in density in this primordial cloud of hydrogen cause the atoms to clump together due to gravity.  This start the domino effect of more and more hydrogen being drawn together until the pressure and temperature became so high that nuclear fusion started to occur, causing the hydrogen to fuse into helium in the universe's first stars.  These stars were super massive and only had very short lifespans compared to most stars found in the universe today.  When the stars died, they went super nova, which briefly (by star lifespan standards) created conditions so hot that the atoms were able to fuse into even heavier elements, such as carbon, oxygen, and iron.\n\nAt the same time, the stars were grouping themselves into clusters and galaxies, and galactic clusters due to gravity, creating many of the larger systems we see today.  Eventually, enough heavier matter was formed and ejected in stars and supernovas for there to be enough mass for planetary systems, like our solar system, to form.\n\nSo quite literally, nearly every atom in your body, on this Earth, and in existence today that isn't hydrogen was once forged inside a star or star supernova.

{"title":"ELI5- Schrodinger's Cat: What exactly does it have to do with quantum mechanics and string theory?","question_detail":"I'm doing a piece for my creative writing workshop and I don't have a tangible hold on what these have to do with each other. I think I know but I'm not sure, so any help would be awesome. I've tried to wiki it and frankly, I just don't understand. I really just want a \"basic\" explanation. I might have a follow-up question depending on the answer. Thanks guys!","answer":"It has nothing to do with string theory at all, and it's only vaguely related to quantum mechanics.\n\nThe first thing to know about Schrodinger's cat is that you should probably just forget it. It isn't a thought experiment, it's not actual science. All it was was a *metaphor* constructed to illustrate how quantum physics is different from what people experience in everyday life.\n\nThe central idea of quantum physics is that systems exist in distinct *states,* and that on a sufficiently small scale, it's possible for a system to be not in any particular state, but rather an *indefinite* state that exists somewhere in between.\n\nThe metaphor goes like this: Put a cat in a box, along with some apparatus which will, at some time in the future, kill the cat. From outside the box, you have no way of directly interacting with either the cat or that apparatus, so you have no way of knowing whether the cat is alive or dead. Of course, at any given instant, the cat *is* either alive or dead; that's obvious. But you can't know which until you open the box.\n\nIf you were going to describe that scenario using the math of quantum mechanics âÂ which you never would, because the math of quantum mechanics can't accurately describe cats âÂ you'd say that the cat can either exist in the \"alive\" state or the \"dead\" state, but that until you open the box and determine for sure which state the cat's in, it's best described as being in a *linear superposition* of states. In essence, the mathematical description of such a cat would insist that until you open the box, the cat is both alive and dead.\n\nBut again, you would never use the math of quantum mechanics to describe a cat. That'd be like trying to use a screwdriver to carve a turkey; it just wouldn't work, because it's the wrong tool for the job. So don't reach any conclusions about either quantum mechanics or pet euthanasia from this metaphor. The point isn't that quantum mechanics is weird, or that cats are undead; the point is just that quantum mechanics works differently."},

{"title":"Enron ","question_detail":"What the hell happened?","answer":"Enron was not a total fraud.  It had some legitimate businesses, like pipelines.  The company constantly had a lot of cash coming in from its legitimate businesses, which allowed its management to pursue all kinds of outlandish ideas for new business lines.  That led to Enron's management being praised for being highly innovative, but most of those ideas went nowhere and lost a lot of money in the process.  They wanted to take unused broadband capacity from businesses and rent it out, which proved to be totally unworkable in practice.  They had the idea of movie streaming into your home many years before Netflix did it.  And they tried to sell electric power in poor countries and lost a lot of money when they found that too few people in those countries could actually pay enough for the power for it to be profitable to sell it to them.\n\nWhen the company lost money on things like that, instead of being honest about the company's results, Enron's CFO would create bogus companies with names like Jedi and Raptor, and move Enron's losses into those companies to get the losses off Enron's balance sheet, and make it look like Enron was a lot more profitable than it actually was.  Those accounting frauds and false profits led the stock price to soar, and at one point Enron was one of the 10 largest US companies by market capitalization.\n\nEnron was also involved in the California energy crisis.  Enron traders deliberately withheld power from the market to cause blackouts, which led to emergency conditions that raised the price of electricity, and then started selling the electricity back to California at the higher price.\n\nEventually, by 2001, more and more people started to question how Enron really made money.  Later that year, it had to restate past accounting statements to remove profits and increase liabilities, its credit rating was cut, and the stock price started tanking.  As its credit rating fell, Enron no longer had the ability to borrow large amounts of money, and it couldn't continue to fund most of its operations or cover its debts.  Within a few months it was bankrupt."},

{"title":"ELI5 How does a battery know when to stop charging?","question_detail":"When a battery is finished charging, whether it be in a computer, cell phone, etc... how does it stop itself from \"over-charging\", so to speak? I understand the answer could be either very simple or very complicated, so just ELI5! ","answer":"Batteries themselves are \"dumb\" things, they would not know when to stop charging. \n\nIt's the job of the charger to constantly check how well the battery is charged and stop sending electricity to the battery once it's full. \n\nBasically, let's take as an example a simple AA battery, which has written on it 1.2v. It has a very low voltage when it's empty, let's say 0.8v. As they charge, the voltage goes very fast to 1.3-1.5v. Once the voltage goes up to this level, the battery will continue to accept electricity but at a much reduced rate and once it's at 1.5 or somewhere around the value it goes up a bit in a very short time and then it almost stops completely... it's as if the battery is \"fed up\". Simply put, the chemical material inside the battery is saturated with electrons.\n\nHere's a typical graph of how battery takes electricity from a charger: \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/1jwoi.png\n\nAs you can see, a smart charger can detect that the voltage no longer increases, it remains at a high level for a long time, and it will either stop or reduce the amount of electricity it sends into the battery, to a very low level, that doesn't hurt the battery. \n\nLithium batteries, the ones in laptops and cell phones, are a bit of a special case... they're more sensitive to heat and to over-charging, so they usually have attached to them a small circuit which disconnects the battery from the charger when it detects something is bad.\n\nYou can read more about how lithium  batteries are charged here: http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_lithium_ion_batteries\n"},

There are probably a few hundered developers all working on it. They need to be coordinated and organized.\n\nAnd organization will set you free...\n\nBut poor managment can make this job hard.

{"title":"ELI5 Why don't all technology companies use aniversal cord for everything?","question_detail":"(e.g. power cord, data cord, etc. all being the same)","answer":"When a company sells their product, they have a choice to make the cords compatible with some popular standard, or not.\n\nFor example, every time apples rolls out a new iphone, they could choose to make the charger microUSB (a popular standard) or the proprietary iphone standard.\n\nSo what drives this choice? Usually just money. If apple is already sure you'll buy their iphone no matter what charger it uses, they can make more money by selling a special charger that costs 30 bucks, rather than a $2 microUSB charger. The charger is not a 'selling point'.\n\nIf a company is NOT sure you'll buy their phone (because it doesn't have a track record, or it's low end, lacks features, or there's lot of competition) then little things like the type of charger become more important... if you're looking to get a 30 dollar walmart flip phone, there's no way you'll buy one that requires a special charger that costs more. Now the charger is a selling point.\n\nThere is a third possibility - a company may sincerely believe they can make a cord that's better than the 'standard'. Going back to apple for a second, they worked to create an faster alternative to USB called Firewire. It never got as popular as usb, but it was better than usb 1.0 and even usb 2.0 (back in the day) so apple pushed to get it made into a new standard, and they were willing to sink some time and money into that different cord just because they felt it was superior (and again it may come down to money... they invented the standard, they probably would profit if it ever caught on like USB)."},

{"title":"ELI5: 2012 NHL Lockout","question_detail":"What exactly is a lockout? Why is it happening this year? What are its chances of it happening? How will it affect the NHL and its players in the future?","answer":"&gt;Why is it happening this year?\n\nThe reason it is occurring this year is basically how to divide the money that the NHL makes. The contract between the National Hockey League (NHL) and the NHL Players Association (NHLPA) is called a Collective Bargaining Agreement or \"CBA\". \n\nThe CBA basically defines the rules and how the profits are shared between the two entities, among other things. In 2005 the NHL-CBA was completely re-drafted and introduced major changes, most notably, a \"salary cap\" which puts a maximum amount of money that each team can spend in a given year on player contracts. \n\nAlong with this the NHLPA's share of \"Hockey Related Revenue\" (HRR) was set at 57%. Meaning that, of all the money that the NHL makes from things related to hockey, the players association was granted 57% of it to divide amongst the players. Meaning the other 43% went to the NHL and team owners.\n\nLast year the NHL made 3.3 Billion dollars, meaning that the players got around 1.8 billion while the NHL got around 1.4 billion. \n\nWith the expiration of the CBA came an opportunity for the two sides to re-negotiate the contract. The proposal that the NHL offered on July 13th, 2012 was structured similarly as the 2005 CBA, with a few key changes:\n\n* \"Reduce the players' HRR share from 57% to 46%\". *However, by changing the definition of what falls under HRR would actually reduce the percentage to the equivalent of 43%.*\n\n* \"Set a maximum of 5 years on players' contracts\" *(previously no maximum)*\n\n* \"Setting uniform salary for each year of a contract\", *which prevents owners from signing contracts where the players make more money in the first half of the contract and less in the second half which impacts the salary cap*\n\n* \"Extend entry level contracts for players entering the league from three years to five.\" *Allowing owners to develop young players for longer without having to risk losing them to other teams.*\n\n* \"Extend qualification for unrestricted free agency from seven years in the league to ten.\" *Meaning that teams retain the exclusive negotiating rights players for up to 10 years depending on how many games they play in the NHL.*\n\nUpon the NHLPA rejecting this proposal and offering a counter proposal which the NHL rejected, the NHL players were \"Locked out\" officially on Sept. 15th at 11:59PM EDT.  \n\n&gt;What are its chances of it happening?\n\nIt's already happening. It started on Sept 15th, 2012 with the expiration of the 2005 CBA. The NHL has already canceled the preseason games that were to be played between Sept. 19th - Sept. 30th.\n\nAs to how long the lockout will last and how many games will be canceled, remains to be seen. Depending on how long it takes for the two sides to reach an agreement. \n\n&gt;How will it affect the NHL and its players in the future?\n\nThe effects of the lockout will be determined by the new CBA when it's agreed upon. More than likely the revenue percentages will change along with some changes to player contracts. "},

{"title":"ELI5: Obama and Romney. Republican and Democrat","question_detail":"Basically, I hear all over reddit that Romney is bad, but why? \n\nI never followed politics, I just want to know why people stand where they stand. \n\nA couple weeks ago my dad went to the DMV and he has never voted in his life. A lady came up to him and convinced him to register to vote. He was having trouble between Republican and Democrat, and the lady tricked him into choosing Republican by saying \"Democrat are more greedy with taxes and taking money away from schools, Republican are wanting to help the people.\" Is that even true?","answer":"The woman should *not* have pushed him to register one way or the other. Thankfully, that won't effect his vote. It might effect if he can vote in the Democratic primary in a couple years, but that subject is for another day.\n\nI'm so excited that your dad has never voted but is now registered! What he was told is obviously not true. He needs to make up his own mind. I recommend he watch a speech from Mitt Romney and a speech from Barack Obama. I'll post each of their convention speeches.\n\n*Really quick, in case you care, I'll explain what the convention and convention speeches are. Skip over this part if you don't care.*\n\n*The Democrats and the Republicans each get to have one candidate to run for President. A few months before the election, they have a big get-together called a convention, where they officially nominate their candidate. So, at the Democratic National Convention, they officially nominated President Obama to run for re-election. At the Republican National Convention, they officially nominated Mitt Romney to run.*\n\nAnyway! Here are the speeches:\n\n[President Barack Obama's acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rl8Ou84s5U)\n\n[Mitt Romney's acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3u1Y0vhtYU)\n\nNow, I want to be completely honest with you before I continue. I am a Democrat. I'm going to do my best to not be biased in my description of the parties, and I'll explain the issues. But, of course, I might not do a good job being objective. \n\nRepublicans tend to believe that the best way to help the economy is to help businesses. It is sometimes called trickle-down economics because they believe that if businesses do well, that money will \"trickle down\" to everyone else. They say it will result in businesses hiring more people and opening up more shops and factories and such. They are very strong proponents of business. They are typically against any regulation on businesses, and they support almost any tax break and subsidy for a business. They also tend to be anti-union because, again, they support the *business.* They also tend to be against any law that makes a company do anything. They typically fight against minimum wage increases, for example. \n\nDemocrats tend to focus on the people, especially working people. Democrats are the ones who tend to support unions and support higher minimum wage. Their belief is that the economy can't do well unless the people are doing well. They say there won't be people out buying stuff from businesses if the people are unemployed and living paycheck to paycheck. So, unlike the Republican's \"trickle down\" economics, Democrats tend to say that the economy grows from the \"middle out.\" Basically, they are saying the best way to help the country is to help middle class, working people. They focus on protecting the people (increased wages and benefits) and put regulations on businesses so businesses can't pollute dangerous chemicals in the water and air.\n\nThere are lots of other issues at play, of course. Things get pretty sticky! Right now, the Republican stance is to be against **gay marriage.** The Democratic platform is to be for gay marriage.\n\nThe Republican platform is to against **abortion** rights. The Democrats say that women should be in charge of their reproductive health, and it shouldn't be up to politicians.\n\nAs far as **taxes** go, Democrats say that the wealthiest Americans aren't paying enough in taxes. They want to end tax breaks on people making over $250,000 a year in order to help balance our national budget. Republicans are against that. They argue that people making over $250,000 a year are the \"job creators,\" and taxing them would mean less jobs would be created. I want to point out how, during the recession, the wealthiest Americans actually got richer. That didn't lead to more jobs. Gah! I gave my opinion there. Oh well, I'm human.\n\nAs far as **education** goes, Mitt Romney wants to make it so people can't deduct their college tuition on their tax forms. He also wants to cut Pell Grants to college students. He sees these as a form of aid and explains that not everyone can go to college (realistically), and it shouldn't be the job of the government to pay for people to go to school. Barack Obama says helping students get into college and pay for it is an investment in our future. \n\nSome other issues this election deal with the environment. President Obama wants to invest in reusable energy. He said that will lead to jobs and less dependence on other countries for oil. He wants to end tax subsidies on oil companies. He recently worked with car companies to set new standards for cars--in less than a decade, cars are supposed to be twice as fuel efficient as they are now. (**Really quickly, I just wanted to mention that some states in the country were passing laws on how fuel efficient cars had to be. Companies didn't like the idea of different states having different limits and regulations, so they actually wanted a federal regulation. Again, that's the Democrat in me wanting to jump in and explain things.**) The Democrats have also recently set limits on how much mercury corporations can pollute into the air.\n\nThe Republicans say those things are not the job of the government. They say the regulations on the air pollutants just hold back businesses. They say it shouldn't be done when the economy is weak, and that we shouldn't be passing new regulations on them. They say car companies should only work on fuel efficiency if that's what customers demand; they shouldn't be forced by the government. Again, this comes down to a very basic division between the parties: The Democrats tend to do what is good for the people, and the Republicans tend to do what is good for the businesses. \n\nThere are a lot more issues I could go over, but I know my post is too long as it is. Maybe just pop a bag of popcorn or something and watch the speeches with your dad. He should definitely make up his own mind, based on what issues are important to *him.* I mean, something like reproductive rights might be really important to me, but they might not be the most important issue to him. You get what I mean. \n\nI hope you both enjoy learning about some of the issues together! One more thing! Go to the polls with him. Even if you can't vote yourself this year, you should get comfortable going. Besides, if it's his first time, he might like the company. You stand in line, and then there are volunteers who check him in. They will tell him where to go. He can ask how to vote. He shouldn't be embarrassed! Every place is different. I voted at one place that had a giant machine, and I voted at another place that had me fill in bubbles like those standardized tests at school. It's always different, so it's OK for him to ask for help. In my experience, the volunteers are always these super friendly, elderly people who want to show you the ropes. Anyway, you can go with him and see what it's like so you know what to do when it's your time to vote. You won't be able to stand in the private booth with him while he casts his vote, but you can stand outside of it. Lots of parents bring children to show them the ropes.\n\nOh! I almost forgot. He'll get an \"I Voted\" sticker. Every election, some businesses give free things to voters. Like... In the past, Chipotle has given free burritos to people who voted, and Ben &amp; Jerry's has given out free ice cream to people who voted. So be sure he gets his sticker!"},

When someone says they support Romney, what are they supporting when all I am seeing is the devil in disguise?","answer":"He's not a horrible person, but he's a politician who's sort of painted himself into a corner.\n\nPrimarily, he's a Republican, which makes people associate him with the bank and economic crises of 2008, the wars in the middles east from the 2000s, and all that other stuff. Most americans think that because President Bush was presiding the country during these events, they are all his fault and, because he was a Republican President, it was the Republican Party's philosophy that caused the current crises. In reality, all of these problems were building up over the course of many years, even decades, but the point is that many people think that Republican policies are bad because they were in power when they happened.\n\nSecond of all, he is wealthy. People tend to dislike people that are wealthy for the sole reason that they themselves are not. It's typical envy and jealousy that everyone has. Personally, I respect him for being able to garner that wealth in his lifetime but people tend to assume that rich people, like banks, gain their wealth primarily by taking advantage of the less fortunate. It paints him as a 'bad guy' in the public view.\n\nThird, he's a conservative, especially on social issues. Where he (and by association, Paul Ryan) stands on abortion, gay rights, gun control, and other issues further paints him as a 'bad guy' in the eyes of the people. \nThe only people that want to restrict the rights of gays and women must be a backwards thinking person who doesn't deserve to rule america.\n\nHe is, though, a businessman, and knows a lot more about macroeconomics than me, most journalists, and probably a fair amount of politicians. I would trust him to help get our country out of trouble. However, I believe that he's alienating way too many moderates with his social issues to be able to win against President Obama, and that's not an artifact of what he personally believes in but how the Republican Party wants to present itself. \n\nWhich brings me to the TL;DR: Romney knows his shit economically but is guided by the Party to present himself in a way that is too right-of-center to be appealing to the masses.\n\nDISCLAIMER: Chances are something is *factually* wrong with this, so do your own Google searches."},

The two main splits were the Great Schism in the 11th century and the reformation in the 16th century.\n\nRome (West) and Istanbul/Constantinople/Byzantium (East) were two large Christian centers.  Rome was an important site because the first Bishop of Rome (Peter) was an apostle of Jesus and significant in spreading Christianity.  The East split due to disagreements over Papal supremacy and the Nicene Creed, a statement defining what it was to be Christian.  The West became what is now the Catholic Church with the Pope in Rome as the single head; the Eastern Churches are based in Greece/Russia have multiple Metropolitans.  \nTheological differences are totally incomprehensible to me, Filoque, what?, but to a layman there are separate recognizable traditions in music, ritual, allowing priests to marry, and cultural differences due to geographic location.\nThere were Western crusaders that also sacked Byzantium.  This did not endear the Western Church to the Eastern Church residents of the city...\n\nThe Reformation: Martin Luther questioned church policy on Indulgences; monetary payments to the church in return for salvation for yourself or others.  Christians disagreed on whether salvation was due to Faith, Good Works, whether it could be influenced through indulgences, or perhaps salvation was always predestined.  Martin Luther posted his questions (95 Theses) at a church, and made a huge stir.  Martin Luther was excommunicated from the Church of Rome (Western/Catholic) due to his beliefs that salvation was the result of faith alone.\n\nThe Roman Church is commonly known as Catholic.\nThe Eastern Church is known as Orthodox. \nThe movement started by Luther is known as Protestant.\n\nThere are many Protestant churches. The Church of England was started by Henry VIII because he wanted to divorce his wife and the Pope wouldn't grant it.  Henry VIII decided that he didn't need any Pope to divorce his wife, declared himself the head of his own church, married his new blushing bride, and promptly executed her a few years later.\n\n"},

{"title":"Why do some animals like dogs have tails?","answer":"&gt; Animal tails are used in a variety of ways. They provide a source of locomotion for fish and some other forms of marine life. Many land animals use their tails to brush away flies and other biting insects. Some species, including cats and kangaroos, use their tails for balance; and some, such as New World monkeys and opossums, have what are known as prehensile tails, which are adapted to allow them to grasp tree branches.\n\n&gt; Tails are also used for social signaling. Some deer species flash the white underside of their tails to warn other nearby deer of possible danger, and canids (including domestic dogs) indicate emotions through the positioning and movement of their tails. Some species' tails are armored, and some, such as the those of scorpions, contain venom.\n\n&gt; Some species of lizard can detach (\"cast\") their tails from their bodies. This can help them to escape from predators, which are either distracted by the wriggling detached tail, or left with only the tail while the rest of the lizard flees. Tails cast in this manner generally grow back over time, though the replacement is typically darker in colour than the original.\n\n&gt; The tails of most birds end in long feathers called rectrices. These feathers are used as a rudder, helping the bird to steer and maneuver in flight; they also help the bird to balance while it is perched. In some speciesâsuch as birds of paradise, lyrebirds, and most notably peafowlâmodified tail feathers play an important role in courtship displays. The extra-stiff tail feathers of other species, including woodpeckers and woodcreepers, allow them to brace themselves firmly against tree trunks.\n\n&gt; The tails of grazing animals, such as horses, are used both to sweep away insects, and positioned or moved in ways that indicate the animal's physical or emotional state.\n\nSource: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail#Function)."},

{"title":"Gas vs Diesel Engines","question_detail":"I'm trying to see what the main similarities and differences between Gas and Diesel engines are. Both are 4-stroke and use a similar fuel. The primary difference (disregarding fuel) seems to be how the fuel is injected: Diesel using \"Direct Injection\" and Gas using \"Port Injection\". \n\nSupposedly, Gas engines cannot use direct inject because the pressure and temperature could cause premature ignition, but I'm hearing more and more gas cars are using direct injection. \n\nSo what is the real difference and how are these engines growing closer or farther apart over time and into the future?","answer":"They are exactly the same except for a few key differences:\nA gasoline engine ignites a sort of (for this purpose) compressed mixture of fuel and air, that has previously been drawn into the cylinder, with a spark plug, and the much hotter and now expanding gas pushes the piston back down.\n\nA diesel engine compresses JUST air that has been drawn in so much and so hard that its hotter than the ignition temperature of diesel (basically oil). At the top of the compression event, the injector sprays fuel into the super hot air which burns like a flame thrower, further expanding and forcing the piston down.\n\nA few fun facts:\nGasoline engines can run like diesels when a piece of carbon in the cylinder stays red hot after you shut the ignition off. The carbon ignites a drawn in mixture, heats up enough to do it again, and again, and again. Sometimes this can actually make the engine run backwards (bad)\n\nDiesel engines can smoke so bad (like im sure you've seen) because you can inject as much fuel as you want, as the air will only combine with so much fuel, and the extra fuel will be pushed out as sooty black nasty smoke. Gas engines wont run at all if the mixture is too fuel rich.\n\nThe first diesel engine conceived was intended originally to run on peanut oil :D\n\nTL;DR Gas engines are explosion engines, diesel engines are flame thrower engines."},

{"title":"If dreams are made up of memories, why do they usually end up really weird?","question_detail":"Most of the dreams I remember make little to no sense and even my weirder friends say I must be on drugs to have dreams like I do. Why do they get so messed up?","answer":"The explanation I subscribe to is this:\n\nThe brain is a **pattern-matcher** - it loves to find patterns of **similarities and differences** wherever it can - in what you are conscious of when you are awake, and in your memories and ideas when you are asleep. The patterns it finds get stored as new patterns. And this is how you learns things without you even trying!\n\nWhen the brain finds a pattern match between something in the outside world and something in your memories and ideas, it's like a **successful identification** has taken place - it's a match! \n\nWhen you are **awake**, you are aware of many of these \"matches\" *when* you are consciously aware of something - oh,  a Tree! Spaghetti for dinner! I like that! What a beautiful sky! The car is stopped at the lights!\n\nNow the **outside world** makes logical sense because reality is logically consistent. Things don't happen back to front or inside out - a car continues being a car, a dog stays a dog. So all the matches between the outside world and inside world maintain a consistency - because outside is consistent.\n\nWhen your Consciousness **goes to sleep**, the mind stops receiving  information from the eyes and ears and outside world. The brain continues it's search in your **inside world**, going through and comparing memories/ideas with *other* memories/ideas! \n\nBefore, the outside world was half of the match, and it kept things consistent and logical! But those rules don't apply inside - the brain is comparing inside patterns with inside patterns. \n\nUsually you are not aware of it ... unless ... you are **a little** bit awake! And then you can watch your brain looking for patterns! When it finds certain types of \"matches\", they appear in your imagination - and this is where you watch the dream unfold.\n\nThe brain is looking through and comparing all your stored pieces of ideas for similarities and differences. Maybe cars are stored in that drawer, a elves and goblins in that drawer, \"running\" in this cupboard, smelly things over here, tallish things over there, loud things here, a set of \"things you did that made you feel guilty, or happy, or angry\" over there. And the brain is rifling through trying to find patterns, so it can make new drawers and store new patterns in them. Maybe later, when you are awake, your brain will find those patterns out in the real world!\n\nYour half awake mind is watching all this, *thinking* its watching the outside world. So your brain *also* tries to make sense of it - as if its looking at the real world. Where possible, it *supplies you with the missing information* (just like when you are awake), so that you can make as much sense of the scene as possible!\n\nI think this explains why sometimes our dreams are really weird! \n\n-----------------------------     \n\n**Afterthought**:\n\n\n\n*This might also be a reason why* **animals with brains need sleep** - *so the brain can concentrate on finding patterns in what you have experienced, and not annoy you with strange and non-sensical matches while you are awake!* Weird Dreams are certainly **not something you should worry about** - dreaming like we do is part of being human.\n\n:)\n"},

For example, stepping around gum on the sidewalk. After avoiding it, you forget it ever existed.\n\nMid-term are things you need to remember for a few minutes or more such as tasks. Wake up and realize you need a gallon of milk. Pick it up after work, and forget about it the next day.\n\nLong-term is for people and places. Names, faces, stores, etc. Occasionally, short or long term items end up here simply because you thought about them for 2 seconds longer than average.

{"title":"ELI5: Recurring Dreams","answer":"You didn't ask a question. Why do dreams recur? What does it mean if a dream recurs? Either way, here's two explanations of what two psychologists think of dreams:\n\n1) Hidden Meaning. I forget the psychologist who thought this theory up, but the idea is that your sub-concious does not work in literal terms and instead uses concepts to express what it's thinking while you're dreaming. For example, something on fire or the presence of fire in a dream can imply a very passionate emotion. Or a large phallic object such as a tower or sword can represent you (if you're a guy). Example: Your dream is of you in a tower that is burning to the ground. Your attractive english teacher is starring at you, when suddenly you have to fight an unrecognizable man using swords. This would imply you have the hots for your teacher.\n\n2) Random signals. Don't remember who thought this theory up either. Again it's your subconcious working in weird ways... but this one is more scientific. While you're sleeping your brain is at rest but still shoots off signals to make sure your brain is working. It only taps into your subconcious so it is likely about things you are already thinking about. This explains why you can dream about someone you just met or an old memory if you recently looked at a yearbook or something. It also explains why Cthulhu can be cleaning your karate trophies in a dream, for no real reason.\n\nEither way, the result is the same: If a dream recurs, it's because you're still thinking about it. Whether you think your sub conscious is trying to tell you something or not depends on your viewpoint."},
{"title":"ELI5: Dry and moist adiabatic lapse rate and the difference between them.","question_detail":"I'm trying to understand what dry adiabatic lapse rate and moist adiabatic lapse rate are, but I can't seem to find a clear definition or explanation online. I tried wikipedia, but the page only confused me further, and there is no simple wiki for \"lapse rate.\" \n\nCan anyone explain it like I'm five? \n\nEdit: Also, does environmental lapse rate have anything to do with the other two, or is that something else entirely? ","answer":" Air expands the higher it goes up because there is less pressure.  Conversely, it compresses the lower it goes because there is more pressure. \n\nWell adiabatic temperature change is the cooling or warming of air caused when air expands or compresses ( cooling or warming of air if it goes up or down). The only difference between dry and moist temperature change is that the rate at which this change occurs.  \n\nThe dry adiabatic lapse rate is 1 degree C every 100 meters. All this means is that in unsaturated air, (air without any moisture in it or \"dry\") a parcel of air will either become colder or warmer by ~10 degrees C every 1000 meters depending on how much it is moved vertically. \n\nThis is almost the same for the wet adiabatic lapse rate except that the rate at which the temperature changes is different.  The rate is 5 degrees C every 1000 meters.  The reason is because the wet adiabatic lapse rate is used when the air is saturated or 100% humidity.\n\nIf you need more clarification or something i said confuses you let me know "},

{"title":"ELI5: If pain serves primarily a cautionary function, why is it that we can pass out from the pain? Why isn't there a very painful but at least bearable maximum?","answer":"It's actually kind of an old wives' tale that you can pass out from pain. There's no actual evidence linking the pain response to unconsciousness â¦ though there *is* empirical evidence illustrating the impact of pain on things like mental acuity and memory recall.\n\nThe act of passing out goes by the fancy-schmancy medical name of *vasovagal syncope.* Syncope is, technically, any transient loss of consciousness, and there are tons of different possible causes. The term vasovagal refers to a response that happens in the nervous and circulatory systems that originates from a part of your body called the vagus nerve.\n\nPut simply, what happens when the vasovagal response is triggered comes in two parts: cardioinhibition and vasodepression. Those two fancy words mean a lowering of the heart rate and the dilation âÂ \"getting bigger,\" basically â of your blood vessels. The net result of these two things is that the amount of blood going to your brain per second falls, so you can feel lightheaded or dizzy, or you can lapse into unconsciousness briefly. Hence, vasovagal syncope: the transient loss of consciousness due to the lowering of heart rate and blood pressure that follow on from the vasovagal response.\n\nHere's the connection to your question: The vasovagal response can be brought on by, among other things, basically any unpleasant stimulus whether direct or indirect. You know how they say some people \"faint at the sight of blood?\" That's what they're talking about: for some people, seeing another person get injured, even under totally controlled and safe circumstances like a blood draw at the doctor's office, is enough to trip their vasovagal response, and they're out like a light.\n\nSo the whole \"pass out from pain\" thing is mostly related to vasovagal syncope. Any traumatic experience or sudden shock *can* â doesn't always, even in the same person âÂ lead to a sharp lowering of heart rate and blood pressure that induces a brief spell of unconsciousness.\n\nOf course, the other thing is that pain is often associated with blood loss, and in cases of severe blood loss unconsciousness inevitably results for the same reason as the syncope of the vasovagal response âÂ a deprivation of oxygen from the brain. The difference there is that vasovagal syncope is usually self-correcting; whatever triggered it usually goes away as soon as you pass out, so your heart rate and blood pressure rapidly return to normal, bringing you out of it in a few seconds or minutes. Unconsciousness due to blood loss is very much *not* self-correcting, which is why controlling bleeding is the second most important step doctors take when treating an injured person after getting them breathing."},

{"title":"ELI5:How does the president \"create\" jobs?","answer":"Generally it means doing things which either directly (rarely) or indirectly (almost always) lead to growth in the employment sector of the economy. What a shock, I know, but bear with me.\n\nImagine you have a factory where you employ ten workers. You have the option of adding a second shift of ten more workers. By running the assembly line sixteen hours a day instead of eight, you'll produce more widgets per day, which will â in principle âÂ allow you to sell twice as many widgets each month. Since your basic operating expenses are already covered by the revenues you're currently getting, the lion's share of these additional revenues will be profits, and profits are delicious tasty treats to a seasoned capitalist such as yourself.\n\nHow do you go about deciding whether to pull the trigger on Plan Hire More Guys?\n\nWell, first you get all of the basic facts out of the way. Can your factory actually acquire the raw materials to make twice as many widgets a month? If you're using lithium as fast as the miners can pull it out of the ground, there's no point in working any harder, because you'll be constrained by your suppliers. But let's pretend for sake of argument that your supply chain is unfettered.\n\nIf that's the case, you move on to questions of *revenue.* If you put twice as many widgets on sale per month, will they all fly off the shelves, or will half of them sit there gathering dust? That depends on a lot of things. First and foremost, it depends on a concept called *market saturation.* If your factory is making space shuttles, you know there's a very strictly limited demand for your product, so there's no point ramping up the volume.\n\nBut if you're making anything *else,* then you have to face the question of whether *people want to buy what you're selling.*\n\nThis is where the concept of *consumer confidence* comes into play. Consumer confidence is an economic metric âÂ measured and quantified in a hellishly complex way âÂ that basically represents how consumers *feel.* When consumer confidence is high, people are more likely to spend money. When it's low, they're more likely to save up for a rainy day. If you're pretty sure you're going to be losing your job next week, even if you have the cash burning a hole in your pocket you're unlikely to take the missus out for a dinner of lobster thermidor and La Grande Dame 1975.\n\nSo one way the president can be reasonably said to \"create jobs\" is by doing things that boost consumer confidence. That can be something as complex as getting a massive and widely praised stimulus initiative passed through the legislature â¦ or as simple as *promising* to get a massive and widely praised stimulus initiative passed through the legislature.\n\nBut there's a different kind of job growth. The previous example posited that you had a working factory and you were considering hiring more workers to run it. That's what's called an *operating expenditure.* You'd be sinking more money into the day-to-day running of your factory âÂ paying workers' salaries, specifically. But a different kind of job growth comes from what's called a *capital expenditure.* That would be like if you had one factory working at full capacity and you were considering building another one.\n\nIn that case, you're constrained not just by those things we talked about before, but also by the *price of money.* Whenever you need capital to do something âÂ basically a big sum of money you mean to spend all at once doing something specific âÂ you have to consider how much it costs you to obtain that money. For instance, if you're going to take out a bank loan to build that new factory, you need to consider the rate of interest you'll have to pay for that loan.\n\nSo the other way the president can be reasonably said to \"create jobs\" is by having his administration enact policies that lower the price of money. In the US, that's usually the Federal Reserve's board of governors lowering the federal funds rate, which reduces banks' cost of doing business and allows them to lower interest rates to borrowers.\n\nOf course, that only works if it works. If the president sits down with the Fed chairman and persuades him to cut the funds rate by a half a point, but borrowing doesn't trend upward in response to the lower price of money, the most you can say is that that president *attempted* to create jobs, but was unsuccessful.\n\nSo really, it comes down to being rather like the captain of a ship. He doesn't stoke the boilers, he doesn't plot the course, and he doesn't man the helm, but he's the one who brings the ship into port by coordinating the actions of those under his command â¦ and if anything goes wrong, even if he didn't make the mistake himself, the responsibility is on his shoulders until really persuasively proven otherwise."},

What is out there?","answer":"If you move a small probe not along the plane that is filled with planets plane you can not accelerate by moving close to one more of the planets to use its mass for acceleration in a flyby.\n\nOn a larger scale this doesnt matter as much anymore because space is filled equally with mass. some areas just have it more concentrated. Also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud\n\nWhen solar systems form around suns, the cloud that formed the sun has a lot of angular momentum around it that gets transferred equally to the planets that form around it, only variyng in strength by distance.\n\nThis is why all planets move around the sun mostly on the same plane in ellyptical orbits.\n\nVery similar rules apply to our milky way galaxy."},

{"title":"ELI5: What is a flat tax and why is it a good or bad idea?","answer":"It's any tax where every citizen pays the same percentage of their earnings in tax. If the constant marginal rate is 25%, you pay a quarter of your earnings, no matter who you are, no exceptions, period, end of paragraph.\n\nThey're considered to be good by some because they're \"fair.\" That is, the same number of slices is taken from everybody's pizza.\n\nThey're considered to be bad by (let's just face it here) most because they ignore a key principle of economics called the diminishing marginal value of money. That's a fancy name, but basically it means that the first dollar a person earns in a given period â a year, say â is worth more than the second dollar, which is worth more than the third dollar, and so on.\n\nFor example, say it costs you $10 a day just to be a person. Roll into that food, housing, transportation, whatever; that's the essential price you must pay every day just to be.\n\nHow important to you is the tenth dollar you earn every day? It's pretty darned important! It literally makes the difference for you between paying for the base necessities and *not* paying for them.\n\nOn the other hand, how important to you is the *hundredth* dollar you earn a day? Not very, particularly compared to the importance of that tenth dollar. You've already got your needs covered; everything you make beyond that is a luxury.\n\nAnd your *thousandth* dollar? I mean really, if it costs you $10 a day to be a person, the difference between $999 and $1,000 is fairly negligible â¦ and the difference between $99,999 and $100,000 is *entirely* negligible.\n\nBy proposing to take the same percentage of everybody's income, you're actually taking *a more valuable slice* of the income of a person who makes less than you are of a person who makes more. If you're taking 25% off the top from everyone, the guy who makes $12 a day ends up with $9 â¦ a buck less than he needs just to be a person. While the guy who makes $10,000 ends up paying $2,500 â¦ which sounds like a hell of a lot of money to the guy who makes $12, but is actually quite an easy price to pay for the guy who makes $10,000.\n\nA flat tax, therefore, is mathematically fair, but disproportionately hurtful. It hurts more to hand over 25% of your gross when you make barely enough to get by than it does to hand over 25% of your gross when you're bathing in caviar and propping up your wobbly table with truffle slices.\n\nSo some people â and again, to be fair we must say \"most\" here â agree that a flat tax is actually more unfair than it is fair, because not all dollars have the same value to everyone. But again, not everyone agrees that this is true."},
{"title":"ELI5: The Salt and Ice Method","question_detail":"There's a lifehack out there that describes how to make a drink (sealed) ice cold in 3 minutes flat.\n\nThe process: Place your drink in a large pot, cover it with ice, sprinkle two cups of salt over the ice and in 2-3 minutes it will be ice cold.\n\nMy question is: how does this work exactly and why?","answer":"Okay, so you have some water, right. Water is a liquid at room temperature, but it becomes a solid when it freezes. We call frozen water ice. This much is obvious to everybody.\n\nWhat's less obvious is exactly *how* ice freezes â which is key to understanding how ice melts. See water molecules have a natural tendency to want to \"stick\" together through a mechanism called hydrogen bonding. But at room temperature, the molecules are oscillating fairly quickly, which keeps them from sticking together very much. Liquid water is still fairly sticky; we call that property \"surface tension.\" It's just that at room temperature, the water molecules are oscillating quickly enough that the won't stick together *much.*\n\nBut when you cool water down, the molecules oscillate more and more slowly, until they're finally moving slowly enough that hydrogen bonds can form between them. This causes the water molecules to sort of \"snap\" into a regular arrangement. We call that arrangement of molecules a \"crystal,\" which is where the term \"ice crystals\" comes from.\n\nBelieve it or not, *freezing makes things warmer.* That's because when water crystallizes, the molecules go from oscillating *some* â not a lot, but still some, because the water is still a liquid â to oscillating hardly at all. That extra energy has to *go* somewhere. It's not a lot of energy, but it can't just disappear, so it comes out of the growing crystalline structure as heat.\n\nThe reverse is also true: It takes energy to melt ice. In order to break those hydrogen bonds and get the molecules moving again, you have to put energy in. If you leave an ice cube out on your counter, you'll notice that it starts melting right away â¦ but that it *doesn't* melt *instantly.* That's because it takes time for the heat energy in the environment â the countertop and the air â to migrate into the ice and break those bonds.\n\nThing is, in reality this process of heat flowing in and melting the ice actually happens more slowly than it should. That's because you end up with a sort of *reflection* of heat from the surface of the ice cube. Heat flows into the ice and starts breaking hydrogen bonds at the surface; that gives you water. But the ice farther into the cube draws heat out of that water and *immediately starts freezing it again,* and the act of re-freezing the ice radiates heat back out into the environment again.\n\nIn practice, of course, the rate of heat transfer into the ice is way faster than the rate of heat reflection back into the environment, which is why ice melts at all rather than staying like it is. But that heat that's being reflected back still puts a limit on how fast ice can cool something down.\n\nWhen you add salt to ice, the salt crystals dissolve in the water on the surface of the ice. You end up with sodium and chlorine ions floating in the water â¦Â and those sodium and chlorine ions get in the way of crystallization. So the salty water on the surface of the ice doesn't re-freeze as readily as it would if it were pure water. So the amount of heat energy that's being \"reflected\" off the ice is cut drastically, meaning on balance, more heat flows from the environment into the ice, melting it.\n\nThe net result is that a thing that's being chilled with pure water ice alone won't get cold nearly so fast as a thing that's being chilled with water ice that's got salt on it. The salt makes the melting ice draw heat out more quickly."},

{"title":"ELI5: Can someone explain what these proofs mean? (origami and math)","question_detail":"http://nyjm.albany.edu/j/2000/6-8.pdf <-- This right here. I just want a simple explanation!","answer":"The Greeks studied geometry based on lines and circles that they could scratch on the ground. Their basic tool for things was string. With string, they could draw straight lines (hang the string between two points, and it'll hang over a straight line between those two points) and circles (fix one end and keep the line taut as you sweep out a curve, and you'll cover all the points that are the same distance from the center; that's a circle), and measure distances. By combining those tools, they found ways of doing things like finding the line that divides a triangle exactly in half and passes though one of its angles, or drawing perfect pentagons.\n\nEven when they started drawing on paper, they made tools that did the same thing; straightedges and compasses.\n\nSome mathematicians who like origami noticed that, by using folds in paper (instead of ink and straightedges), they could do the same sorts of thing. If you had two lines that form an angle, and wanted to find a third line that divided that angle exactly in two, you can do that in just one fold (with a compass and straightedge, it takes several steps).\n\nThis paper is about setting up a formal way of describing the steps that you can use in folding, and looking at the kinds of problems that you can solve, using those steps."},
{"title":"ELI5: why doesn't ice cream freeze into a solid? (it remains softish)","answer":"There are two key ingredients/additives in commercial ice cream. These are called **Stabilisers** and **Emulsifiers**.\n\nThe two used in Ice Cream are called **Guar Gum &amp; Xanthan Gum**.\n\n***Guar Gum*** comes from seeds from the Guar Plant. It is a refined additive which acts like a Thickening Agent/Emulsifier. When used in small quantities, it prevents the growth of ice crystals which would cause the ice cream to harden into icicles.\n\n***Xanthan Gum*** is a Stabiliser that comes from Seaweed and is also used in foods as a gelling agent and thickener. This Stabiliser helps keep air in the ice cream mixture\n\nWithout these two additives, yes Icecream would freeze into more of a solid."},

For each block in the partition, at least one of the two functions is a bijection on that block.  Since the partition was defined so that elements of one block never get mapped to elements in another block and we have a bijection on each block, we can construct a bijection on the whole space from those parts.\n\nLike I said, that's totally not an ELI5 answer, but if you want more details ask again over in /r/learnmath."},

People have noticed, that when you combine two compounds, resulting substance will weight the same as those two. Also, if you were to break substance into its compounds, then these would also weight the same. \n\nBotanist Robert Brown observed through microscope that pollen grains floating in water were moving in a random pattern. Later Einstein theorized, that this random pattern was caused be water molecules jiggling and hitting the pollen.\n\nJ.J. Thomson worked on cathode rays and discovered, that his rays can be bend by magnetic field. Instead of thinking it was another form of light, he assumed very light, negatively charged particles he called \"corpuscles\" (other scientist renamed them to electrons). He thought that electrons came from molecules of gas and proposed model in which electrons were parts of an neutral atom (which meant atoms were divisible) that resided in a uniformly positive field, so that their charges cancelled out.\n\nThen came Rutherford (early 20th century) with planetary model in which electrons were orbiting a central positively charged nucleus. \n\nThere was a problem though, because it is known that orbiting charged particles would emit some photons and lose speed spiralling into nucleus. It clearly wasn't the case, so Bohr made a model in which electrons were only in certain orbits around nucleus and could only change them by jumps, instead of spiralling downwards. "},

I don't know, collapse under the instability on relying on foreign money to make its way into the country? Moreover, what's the legality of this? (I would assume there would have to be some sort of \"approval\" or something by the US to certify such a major reliance on their economy)","answer":"Okay, to give an explanation of why it works, first you have to understand what money is.\n\nBefore money, you had barter. An exchange where both parties agree that a certain amount of given good (item, object, property, etc) or service (ie. action by an individual) from one party is worth a certain amount of a good or services from the other party. ie. We both agree that my dozen apples is worth the same as your fancy hat and we trade them.\n\nThe problem with barter is that quite often you want a specific good or service from a person and they don't want anything of yours. However, if we can get everyone (or just about everyone) to agree on the worth of some item that everyone has, then we can trade goods and services for that item and then trade that item for whatever we need. This is currency. In classic times, people typically used something that was rare enough to be valuable. Gold, sea shells, etc were all used. Eventually, just about everyone agreed that gold was a good item to use as a basis for currency. Paper money in the USA was originally an IOU for an equivalent amount of gold (ie. 1$ bill is worth 1$ of gold). Now and days, it's more complicated then that but the original idea remains: That a given amount of currency is worth a certain amount of goods or services. The amount it's worth is determined by general consensus based on a number of factors.\n\nNow, back to the original question: So long as the people of El Salvador all agree to accept US dollar bills and agree on it's value, then they work just as well as if they were using their own money. This has a number of pros and cons but in the end it boils down to ease of trade with the USA but at the cost of greater reliance on the USA economy (and the whims of the US government). Most countries don't want to take that risk or lose their independence but (for whatever reason) El Salvador decided to take on that risk."},

You will group and ungroup layers according to what you are trying to achieve.\n\nFor example, let's say you finished one side.  That means you have one layer complete out of four.  Just pretend that the last two layers are glued together.  That will allow you to solve the second layer, as if it was the middle layer of a 3x3x3.  \n\nThen you'll have two layers solved and two unsolved.

{"title":"ELI5: Einstein's Theory of Gravity","question_detail":"I understand the general concept behind it. Space is flat, but anything that has mass curves it. The more mass an object has, the more space is going to curve. \n\nWhat I don't understand is how that relates to when I drop an object, it always falls. And how is it possible that objects can sometimes be torn apart or destroyed by other objects that have extreme gravity, such as a sun or a black hole? How could simply the curvature of space do that? Or am I just completely misunderstanding the concept?","answer":"There are many was to think about this, one way is via the gravitational differential, that is, how much gravity changes over a very same distance. When gravity is very very strong, it will also change very very very fast...think about hovering just a few inches over a black hole, your feet are almost touching it... by your head is very far away, that means the gravity is pulling really hard on your leg compared to your head... like jerking someones arm who is just standing there...OUCH... you could pull an arm off doing that... in the same way, the black hole will pull your legs off...\n\nAnother way to think about it, is imagine some regular graph paper... very nice regular squares, right? Now imagine the square in the center of your paper is expanding, getting bigger and bigger...what happens to the other squares? Well the ones right next to it get scrunched together, and the closer you are to the edge of the growing square, the more scrunched the other squares are... that is curvature, the normally flat lines are being scrunched.... until (like in a black hole) right next to the edge, the other squares around it have vanished, there is like ring of squares that have vanished, and the further you get away, the less and less the squares are squished, until you are far enough away, that the squares are the normal \"flat\" squares you had before you started growing the center one...\n\nOK, now image you draw a little stick man on the surface of the giant square.. the squares that are round his feet are really squished and up by his head the squares are not so squished... OK, now here is the fun... keep the stickman fixed to the underlying grid and shrink the black hole back to a normal size... and all the other squares too.. what happens to the stick man?? He gets stretched... and because there are lots of grid lines under his legs, his legs really get stretched.. they get stretched so much, his legs get torn apart and ripped off his body."},
{"title":"How do MRI's work? ","question_detail":"Just watched the MRI of broccoli gif...","answer":"Some nuclei in atoms possess a property called spin. This doesn't mean the nuclei rotate like how you imagine a spinning ball. It's just a quantum mechanical property where the maths works the same way as angular momentum. It's hard to explain, so I'll stop trying now. \n\nAnyway, if you put these nuclei in a magnetic field, the spins can align either with the field or against it, and there's an energy difference between these states. As it happens, radio frequency photons (the quantum mechanical way of talking about light or other electromagnetic radiation) can promote the nuclei from one state to another, and the exact energy gap is proportional to the frequency of the photon in question. \n\nNow, hydrogen nuclei are one of these nuclei with spin, and the energy gap between the states is related to the environment it's in (the atoms that are next to it). This means that you can tell the difference between, say, water and alcohol. That's basically how it works. Reply if you have any questions!\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: How does Romney's \"tax cut\" + closing loop holes = higher taxes for the middle class?","question_detail":"Canadian here and watched the debate.  I keep hearing that Romney's tax cut (20% across the board + taxing capital gain, etc) would actually end up giving big corporations more money and cost the middle class more.  How? 20% less is 20% for the middle class too is it not?","answer":"For a tax cut to be revenue neutral like Romney said repeatedly this would be, it means that every cut must mean an equal increase somewhere else. So by definition, if some people end up paying less taxes, but the same amount of taxes are being paid, someone is paying a higher effective rate.\n\nI'll give a simple example with numbers:\n\nWith taxes there is the basic rate and deductions. Say you make $50,000/year and owe $15,000 in taxes before deductions. You are paying a 30% rate.\n\nBut if you have two children under 18 living with you, those count as a \"deduction\" which allow you to subtract how much money you owe from the $15,000 you start with. If you get a $2,500 deduction per child, you end up only owing $10,000, which means your effective tax rate is 20%.\n\nNow the 20% cut would be before deductions, so you would start only owing 24% or $12,000. That's a $3,000 cut!\n\nBut to pay for this tax cut, he is going to eliminate deductions (but he has not said which deductions) to keep the total tax money balanced. Say he now says you don't to deduct children under 18. You would be left having to owe the full $12,000, which is actually a $2,000 tax increase!\n\nThese are all hypothetical, but it's to show how lowering the rate does not *always* lower the total taxes paid if you also lower deductions."},

{"title":"ELI5: How do cars work?","question_detail":"How do cars go about turning combustion into the rotation of tires?","answer":"Let's build it up backwards. We know that there's going to be a rotation coming out of the engine, used to turn the wheels, so there has to be a rotating shaft. This shaft is called the crankshaft (or crank, for short). It looks a bit weird because it's not just a straight shaft - it has bits offset to push on to make the turning motion. [Here's a picture of one](http://crankshaftsale.co.za/images/cs%20banner.jpg). You can see the offset parts. Connected to these offset parts are a rod, and a piston. These pistons sit in cylindrical holes in the engine block (the big lump). Because of the shape of the crankshaft, at different times, different pistons will be at the top of the travel, in exactly the same way as bicycle pedals are at the top at different times, and just like bicycle pedals they are going to get pushed down to make the turning force by pushing on the rod that's connected to the offset parts of the crankshaft. [Here's a picture of a crankshaft with the rods on](http://www.hayabusazone.com/resources/cranks/ultimatecrank.jpeg). The pistons live on the end of the rods. [Here's a picture of a rod with a piston on the end](http://www.chevroletls1.com/Images-Ls7-engine/10-Titanium_rod_and_atmo_piston%5B1%5D.jpg).\n\nThis is where the combustion happens. When you burn air and fuel it makes exhaust gasses, and these gasses are much bigger than the air and fuel mixture before the burn, which means that if they're confined in a space they'll push on the walls of it, hard. The space the burning happens in has the piston as the bottom, which means that the big hot exhaust gasses press down on the piston and push it down. [Here's a picture of an engine block](http://image.turbomagazine.com/f/9325912/0609turp_21z+honda_f20c_stroker_build+engine_block.jpg). If you look inside each of the cylinders you can see the top of each of the pistons.\n\nNow, all we need to worry about is getting air and fuel in to the engine and to get the exhaust gasses out of the way once we're done with them so that we can get more air and fuel in.\n\nBolted to the engine block is the cylinder head (or head, for short). [Here's a picture of one](http://www.bguk.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/cylinder-head.jpg). The flat face that's facing the camera in that photo matches up to the engine block with the cylinders in, so it would actually be facing down instead of towards the camera. The blue and grey things in the head are the valves. Some of the valves let in air and fuel when it's open. The others let the exhaust gasses out of the cylinder into the exhaust pipe. If you look back at the picture of the engine block where you can see the top of the pistons, then you'll notice some dents in the top of the pistons. Those dents were manufactured there, and they are there to allow the valves to not hit the piston. There is also a small hole in the middle of the three valves in that picture. That hole is where the spark plug pokes in to the cylinder. The spark plug creates a spark that ignites the air and fuel mixture to make it burn to create the exhaust gasses to push the piston to turn the crankshaft.\n\nAnd that's how an engine works.\n\nAre there any parts that you'd like me to expand on?"},

{"title":"ELI5: Why can't humans communicate with other animals? ","answer":"Humans can't communicate on the conceptual level with animals, because animals lack the ability to have/make/use/understand concepts. Concepts are *abstract ideas*. For example the *concept* \"car\" represents every car in existence, past and present, real and imagined, of every variety and shape and colour. The *concept* of \"food\" implies the whole abstract chain of sustenance and growth, cause and effect, for all sorts of life forms.\n\nBut we can communicate with some animals on the perceptual level - and sometimes quite successfully! \"Percepts\" are things that we can directly perceive, see, touch, feel, hear, smell, taste - they are real objects, or memories of real objects. For example, the *percept* of \"car\" represents a specific car, or specific cars, perhaps the car in your driveway that your dog knows you take him in. The *percept* of food is just the real or imagined specific food that tastes good and makes the belly feel full.\n\nTo communicate with animals, you have to work with them at the perceptual level and be aware that your physical actions and the physical objects you use have meanings and implications/consequences, and that you can use your physical actions to communicate. Different flavoured treats as reward and punishment. Staring at them. Looking away. Ignoring. Paying attention. Baring teeth. Nuzzling. Playing. Jumping around. Searching and seeking. Hands raised or turned at different speeds. The intensity and rhythms of your voice. Your body language when you meet strangers or friends, such as your hunch, your back, your alertness, the height of your chin and spacing of your feet - all these things communicate information to an animal who knows you well! And you can see this in an animal you know well too. In their own way, and in a very similar way to our way, dogs may have many, many tens of thousands of items in their perceptual level vocabulary.\n\nJust like two humans need to learn each other's language before they can communicate, you need to learn a particular animal's language to communicate at that level. A naturalist who has spent years with a tribe of Apes learns to communicate with them. A pet parrot/cat/dog and it's owner get to learn how to communicate each other's perceptual needs (at the commensurate level!) and all these phrases have their physical actions that mean the same thing: e.g. the pet: I'm hungry! I'm bored! Let's play! the owner: Get off the couch! Where's the ball? What's that?\n"},

Look at how close the genetalia section is to the feet and toes section. this is how some people already come ingrained with a predisposition to liking feet. \n\nInterestingly enough this is also the basis for some theories about phantom limb syndrome. When you lose a limb or part of the body, that somatosensoric area becomes useless, and the brain does not like useless space, so it gets taken over by a neighboring area. this is also why some people who have lost a foot or leg can sometimes \"feel\" their legs when going potty or when they are sexually aroused.\n\nI hope you find this as interesting as I did when I studied it!"},

{"title":"ELI5- What occurs during cellular respiration?","question_detail":"I'm having a really tough time grasping the concepts involved in cellular respiration, like redox reactions, glycolysis, the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. Can anyone explain this process given that I have a good grasp on biological functions otherwise?","answer":"If you have a good grasp on biology anyway, you can probably get a more technical answer from askscience or r/biology, but I'll try to give the ELI5 answer anyway.\n\nCellular respiration is taking sugar and oxygen and turning it into carbon dioxide and water, in the process harvesting energy that the cell can use. Glycolysis is basically the first step, and involves breaking glucose into 2 pyruvate (glyco=sugar + lysis=break, breaking down sugar), and harnessing the energy to make 2 ATP + 2 NADH (energy molecules, I'm going to assume you know what ATP is for).\n\nThe Krebs cycle/citric acid cycle/tricarboxylic acid cycle/TCA cycle involves feeding in the pyruvate and turning it into CO2 by passing carbon groups through a series of molecules and enzymes. Again, the purpose of this is to couple an energy-producing step (oxidation of CH2 all the way to CO2) with an energy-storing step (formation of ATP) so that this energy can be used later to fuel various cellular functions.\n\nThe electron transport chain is a bit different: it takes place in mitochondria (or on the cell membrane in bacteria), and involves using NADH and succinate (part of the citric acid cycle) to pass electrons down the line to lower and lower energy compounds, until the electrons get to oxygen (the \"terminal electron acceptor\") and turns oxygen +2 protons into water. In the ETC, unlike the citric acid cycle, the energy is used to pump protons out of the inside of the mitochondria (matrix) to the space between the two mitochondrial membranes. This creates a really high concentration of protons, and they want to get back into the matrix to re-establish an equilibrium. The protons flow through a complex called ATP synthase, which takes the energy from the protons flowing through it (this is called proton motive force) and uses it to make ATP."},

In North Africa these were successful, overthrowing long time dictators. East of Egypt, most of the protests were ended either by *very* harsh tactics or some other way.\n\nSyria is the only exception, when people rose up they were not powerful enough to overthrow the dictator, but the dictator has not been able to end the rebellion. Over the last year and a bit, both sides have been escalating and it is now a full civil war. The current ruler has no way of fully ending the uprising, but the uprising is not strong enough to defeat the military in a conventional way. It also means that the rebels are never able to \"capture\" and hold a city or place for more than a day or two, they have to hide in the cities and strike in small attacks.\n\nBecause there are no \"rebel\" controlled cities, there is no easy way for the rest of the world to supply the rebels. Even if there were a way to do so, Russia has very close ties with the Syrian government, they are the second largest buyer of Russian arms and trade many other things as well.

Either the universe is \"open\", meaning if you and your friend walk side by side in parallel lines you'll get further and further apart; \"closed\", meaning it really is more like a balloon and you could end up crossing your starting point without ever turning around and just go in a giant loop around the universe; or it's \"flat\", meaning that you will always be walking beside your friend, but you'll never see home again without turning around."},
{"title":"What is \"gold plating\" when we're talking about rent control?","question_detail":"In fact, how does most \"rent control\" work? I was wondering if someone could break it down. ","answer":"Most rent control laws have exceptions for when a property is improved, proportionate to the degree of improvement.  So if a landlord wants to force lower income, rent controlled tenants out of his property, he can over improve the property with features they don't really want, and make it too expensive for them to stay. \n\nExample:\n\nYou live in a rent controlled apartment for $500/month, where the market value is $1000/month.  The law saws if your landlord renovates, your rent goes up in proportion to the increase in value.\n\nSo instead of turning it into a $1500/month apartment, which would cost you $750/month, he puts a crystal chandelier and a jacuzzi in, and says it is now a $3000/month apartment, which would cost you $1500, more than you can afford.  \n\nAnd later, if he can only get $2000/month for it, he is still coming out way ahead."},
{"title":"ELI5, Why do digital cameras not produce pictures that have the same 'quality' as non-digital ones?","question_detail":"I understand that they do not use photographic paper or film and are limited to memory constraints etc. But there is still a 'feel' that I don't think I linked to image quality. [Example](http://i.imgur.com/gvnEp.jpg) (especially the glare reflecting off his visor).\n\nI am no expert on photography, so this may sound a little dumb.","answer":"The non-digital ones, whether you're talking cameras or audio records, are analog, which means that they are a continuous accurate measure of the signal- whether light or sound.  A digital one takes a sample of the sound/image at some tiny, and ever tinier interval, and then lines them all up together to make the final product.  Imagine the difference like an inclined plane vs a set of stairs."},
{"title":"ELI5: Why does Canada have higher prices ie. books, movies \nThen USA?","answer":"Books, unlike most consumer goods, usually have a face value, printed on the back.  Bookstores often discount the face value, but have a hard time charging more.\n\nHistorically, the Canadian dollar has been worth about 70-80% of the US dollar.  Since the distribution networks being the US and Canada are highly interconnected, it made sense to have both a US and Canadian face values on the books.  And since the exchange rates fluctuated, higher was safer than lower.\n\nNow that $CAN is par with the $US, this makes less sense.  When that happened in the past, $CAN soon returned to its historical values, so publishers expected that to happen again, and didn't change.  Now that the currencies have been par for a while, publishers might have to change this practice.\n\n**TL;DR** $CAN used to be worth less, and it was easier to print two prices on a book than it was to have a separate US and Canadian versions."},
{"title":"What is the relationship between the English language and the languages it has borrowed from?","question_detail":"Hello r/ELI5,\nIm a classics student and I was just wondering why english has phased out two very important features from the languages it has borrowed from, namely the case system and the gender system? \n\nI know that english has words which stem from Greek, Latin and Germanic languages but as far as I know a mix of these would not have resulted in a loss of these key features, since Greek and Latin share them. Did 'ancient' German dialects have a case system and are they possibly the reason this has been lost? \n\nthanks! ","answer":"A lot of the grammar loses are due to the borrowing.\n\nIt is hard to maintain strict forms when the words your are acquiring carry their own linguistic baggage...you wind up with a lowest common denominator grammar.\n\nFor example, with all the different plural forms (oxen, indices, nuclei, mice, crises, criteria, stigmata, tableaux, cherubim, passersby), it is not terribly surprising English has been reduced to a single plural case."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why does the melodic minor scale have a different ascending and descending order?","question_detail":"Why are they technically the same scale?","answer":"Good explanations given here. What I can add to the discussion is when writing melodies and counterpoint in the classical style you are more likely to be \"required\" to follow the different ascending and descending patterns strictly. Just as you would be required to avoid parallel 5ths. In Jazz, things are much looser. In my Jazz studies, Melodic Minor was almost always the ascending pattern both up and down. Also, there are some very cool modes that come from it like Lydian b7. "},
{"title":"ELI5:  What causes chemicals in a reaction to change color?","question_detail":"Rust or corrosion for example.  Why is the rust a different color than the original chemical?  Also, this: [Lead Iodide](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SqoBZIU_Xwg/TmsAuJ10kRI/AAAAAAAAAGE/nvKIXyVjcis/s1600/Lead+Iodide.jpg).  How does something yellow appear out of two colorless liquids?","answer":"The simplest way to look at it is that the physical properties of the reactants and products in a chemical reaction don't necessarily have anything to do with each other. For example, if you combine hydrogen and oxygen (which are both gases) you get water which is very unlike hydrogen or oxygen. Chemical reactions give the products new structures, densities, shapes, electrical properties, and so on. Sometimes the product will even reflect light differently which results in a change of colour.\n\nIn the case of lead iodide, the reactants are actually two white powders (lead(II) nitrate and potassium iodide) which are both dissolved in water. The fact that you can make solids disappear in water is also pretty amazing if you think about it."},

","answer":"Basically, Obama is in favor of larger government and a social welfare state, including higher taxes, while Romney supports less regulation and a market influenced far more by business than the government, meaning no increase in taxes but very little decrease. Examples of Obama's goals of a social welfare state include Obamacare, his free cell phone policy, the extension of unemployment benefits, etc. Obama's major problem in his first four years is the fact that he more than tripled the national deficit. Other than that, Obama hasn't done too much, since everything he does gets shot down by Congress and vica versa. Basically, if you support government intervention, then Obama is your guy. If you believe in free enterprise and less government regulation, then vote Romney. I'm not going to get into social issues because they are both extremely stereotypical of their party's platform on said issues."},
{"title":"ELI5: Differences between Communism/Socialism/Marxism/Leninism","question_detail":"As an American high school student, we don't really go over it in school, and most of the stuff online expects background knowledge in the readers. Anyone available to help?\n\nAlso, stuff like Democratic Socialism, Marxist-Leninism, and etc. would be great too.\n\nEdit: All of you guys use words that are a little too big for 5 year olds :(","answer":"Marxism is communism in the strictest sense.  It envisions a classless society in which collective ownership of the means of production is shared by the workers.  There is no state, and no national borders, since communism is theorized as being the result of a global revolution by the working class.  Marxism is proposed as a sort of inevitable worldwide outcome, and not a local political movement.\n\nMarxist-Lenninism is the Bolshevik (Russian) modification of Marx's theories, and proposes that a vanguard political party can be empowered by the workers to establish communism in a particular country or area.  It's the sort of impatient, quick fix solution where, instead of waiting for the working classes everywhere in the world to simultaneously become educated, take control of the means of production, and phase out the necessity of the capitalist class, a single political party takes power in a limited area \"on behalf of the workers\".  Ideally, this party is only meant to stay in power long enough to accelerate the conditions necessary for true communism before being phased out.  That didn't really end up happening with the Bolsheviks, because as soon as Lennin died, Stalin seized control of the party, massacred all of his rivals, then did whatever he wanted.\n\nDemocratic socialism is a very broad category, but would presumably always incorporate tenets  of democracy and socialism.  This would include state monopolies on certain industries determined to be in the best interest of the public welfare (socialism), and an inclusive system by which state decisions, including those regarding socialized industries, are made by the general consent of the public (democracy)."},

{"title":"ELI5 Carbon nanotubes","question_detail":"My friend was telling me about them in class and I got pretty confused.","answer":"So Carbon has three major allotropes (that is, structures that consist only of carbon).  Diamond, which is a 3D crystal structure of carbon (it's an octahedron of carbon atoms, if that means anything to you).  Graphite, which is repeating rings of carbon made into long, one atom thick sheets - then stacked on top of eachother.  And graphene, which is a single sheet from the stack of graphite.  \n\nIf you take a sheet of graphene, which is composed of repeating hexagonal rings of carbon (a carbon atom at each vertex) and roll it up into a tube (like rolling a long piece of paper into a tube) you get a carbon nanotube.  \n\nIt's called a nanotube because only very small widths of tubes can be made.  \n\nThey are important/interesting because they have all kinds of interesting physical properties - they are fantastic conductors along the tubes, they have phenomenally high tensile strengths (way, waaaay stronger than steel or spider silk or all the other strong things you've heard about), they interact in a lot of chemically interesting ways.  \n\nA fourth allotrope is called a Buckminster Fullerene, or Bucky Ball - which is sixty Carbon atoms arranged exactly like a soccer ball (again, a carbon atom at each vertex).  \n\nCarbon.  It's what's for dinner.  "},
{"title":"[ELI5]USSR","answer":"The USSR was a Communist dictatorship in Russia and its surrounding countries from 1917 to 1991.  It was formed during World War I by Lenin and Trotsky and was ruled by Stalin for decades.  Those leaders murdered millions of people and jailed millions of others for political crimes, and ruled over a very brutal and repressive government, while the population lived in extreme poverty due to failed economic policies.  After Stalin's death, the mass killing stopped, and the number of political prisoners was much reduced, but the USSR remained very repressive.  The USSR tried to spread Communism around the world, and supported insurgencies and Communist political parties in many countries.  In World War II, the USSR took over much of Eastern Europe and forcibly imposed Communism.  The USSR's support to Chinese and North Korean communists was a major factor in their seizures of power in their countries.  Later, they invaded Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Afghanistan.  In the 1970's, they became less hostile towards the West, and in the 1980's, they began limited political reforms, but it wasn't enough, and in 1989-90 countries started breaking away from their control and they didn't stop them.  By the end of 1991, Gorbachev resigned as the USSR's leader, the USSR dissolved completely, and the Russian part of it became the non-Communist Russia that exists today."},

After a wolf has found a mate they must find a den, once they have they may howl a few times to show that they are marking their territory.\n\n\nAt Full Moon\nHowling is used as a form of long- distance communications during hunting or traveling, sort of how we use telephones today. Wolves and dogs don't howl at the moon. It's easier to howl or make long oooo noises when your windpipe is straight,so dogs lift their heads to the sky.

{"title":"ELI5: Why people hate LeBron James.","question_detail":"I don't know much about basketball, but I have read enough to know that lots more people hate this guy than love him. Why?","answer":"Clevelander here, I'll explain it as straightforward as I can.\n\nImagine you're LeBron James. You grew up in Akron, Ohio, you've led your high school basketball team to numerous state championships, earning yourself national accolades and fame along the way. You're already a superstar, poised to sign a $90 million endorsement contract with Nike, and you haven't even played a minute in an NBA game.\n\nYou're drafted by your hometown (Cleveland) team, the Cavaliers. They have sucked so bad in the recent years that they won the draft lottery and choose you with the first pick. \n\nThe first year is slow, you miss the playoffs. The next few years, you and your team improves. You become an all-star, your team starts winning the division and making the playoffs. The Cleveland Cavaliers slowly become one of the premier teams in the entire NBA with your leadership. You get to the finals one year, but lose. It's okay. There's next year. You win 66 games (out of 82) one season, the best record in the league, but lose to Orlando in the third round. Again, there's always next year.\n\nThe Cavaliers front office continues to work to build a team around you that can win multiple championships. Millions of dollars are invested in you, your team, and your brand. The city erects a multi-story billboard with your silhouette on it, in your honor. You have given hope to a city of hopelessly hopeful sports fans, who year after year, have been handed only disappointment by their franchises. Now, they have you- possibly the best player in the NBA, and arguably one of the best- if not THE best- in NBA history. You have stimulated Cleveland's economy just by your presence, investment thrives, everyone's happy with the Cavs, and fans are attending games in record numbers.\n\nBut, after 8 seasons of this, you get tired. You haven't yet won a championship- you should've won one by now. You're wondering if the front office is doing all it can to give you the best shot to win, you're not sure. Your buddies Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh call you up, you talk over the summer, you think it would be great to play together. \n\nYour contract is up, and there's much speculation over where you'll sign. Cleveland fans are convinced you'll stay- it's your hometown, we've given you everything, we want to win as much as you, \"We love you, LeBron!\" But, other teams offer larger markets (NYC, Miami, and Chicago offer a greater fan base and economic market than Cleveland for the superstar athlete). Your friends play on other teams. And after eight years with no title, again, you're getting bored of Cleveland.\n\nSo, you hold a press conference to announce your decision. Great. Although, this isn't any press conference- this is a nationally televised, hour-long press conference, on ESPN, with more than 13 million people watching, waiting for you to make your decision.\n\nSo, you take a deep breath, and... \"I've decided to take my talents to South Beach and sign with the Miami Heat.\" Clevelanders have dealt with \"The Fumble\" and \"The Drive,\" and numerous other sporting failures in our history. We've watched Al Lerner steal our football team and move the Browns to Baltimore in the middle of the night, and destroy the career of Bernie Kosar, our most loved quarterback of all time. We watched the Indians drop a 3-0 lead in the ALCS to the Red Sox, who went on to win the world series.\n\nNow, thanks to you, we have \"The Decision.\"\n\nEven better, you never told the front office about your decision, leaving them- your most loyal supporters since you graduated high school- on the edge of their seats, waiting for your decision like everyone else.\n\nYou have single-handedly screwed over an entire city- your HOME city. Your jersey will be burned in the streets for weeks. Your supporters will say it was a smart, economically sound decision that anyone would make. You want to win, after all. LeBron haters will say he screwed us all over, he betrayed us, we gave him everything, he's a dirtbag. \n\nThe more reasonable Clevelanders, those which I align myself with, will say this: If you wanted out, fine. Your contract was up. It was fair game. But here's where you fucked up, LeBron- you held an hour-long press conference in your own name, looking like the biggest prima donna in the history of the NBA. You effectively did screw over your entire fan base, by not informing the front office ahead of time. It's not that you left, LeBron- it's HOW you left that leaves you one of the most hated men in the history of Cleveland. And you're not only hated in Cleveland- you will go on to be booed in almost every away arena you play in in the coming seasons. \n\nLeBron showed us all he's an egotistical asshole through his departure of Cleveland. He screwed Cleveland sports fans over, who finally had hope of winning a championship in SOMETHING for the first time in decades. So, I, like millions of others internationally, hate you, your team, and what you stand for. \n\nI know a five-year-old probably doesn't have the attention span to read through all of that, but I wanted to be complete.

{"title":"ELI5: Why is Gawker so obsessed with Reddit?","answer":"Sorry, let me go further. Gawker and it's sister site Jezebel seem to take great glee in exposing (not the best word) what they feel are the \"wrongs\" in the Reddit community and breathlessly elevate themselves to the determiner of all things true and just in Reddit (and come to think of it, the rest of the Internet).

{"title":"ELI5: Myeloproliferative Disease","answer":"I am not a doctor, but I do have a Myeloproliferative Disease: Polycythemia Vera. So, I'll tell you what I know. Your bones have bone marrow, which actually creates your blood. Sometimes, something goes a little weird with the bone marrow and it creates too much blood, or too much of a particular ingredient in blood. Your blood is made up of several ingredients. Some important ones are white blood cells, red blood cells, cells called \"platelets\" etc. If your bone marrow is making too many white blood cells, you end up with a pretty serious resulting disease called leukemia.  If your bone marrow makes too many red blood cells, you end up with what I have: polycythemia. \n\nSo, a person with a Myeloproliferative Disease actually ends up with two diseases, kinda. One, the bone marrow is not working properly. And this results in: two, a type of cancer. Anytime your body makes too many of one kind of cell, especially when this overproduction is uncontrollable, it's considered a type of cancer. So, leukemia is the uncontrolled creation of white blood cells. It's a blood cancer. Polycythemia, which is what I have, is the uncontrolled creation of too many red blood cells. It's also considered a type of cancer of the blood. "},

{"title":"ELI5: The physical limits of the human body","question_detail":"For example, the world record for a bench press is a little over 1,000lbs. If the same person trains and trains, what's to stop them from benching lets say 2,000lb? Or what's to stop someone from running under 9 seconds in the 100m? This isn't just limited to olympic sports but just using them as examples.","answer":"Nobody knows what the physical limits are when it comes to things like that. That's why athletes keep setting new world records: because we haven't hit any hard limits in athleticism yet. It's clear that they *exist* âÂ nobody's going to run a hundred yards in one second. But where those limits are, exactly, remains unknown.\n\nThere are some hints, though, that it's just not that simple. Take Bob Beamon, for example. He's a former track-and-field athlete famous-to-the-point-of-being-a-household-name for his long jump at the 1968 Olympics. Prior to Beamon's performance, the record for the long jump had increased pretty steadily by a few inches at a time; the most dramatic shattering of the record prior to Beamon was when an athlete (whose name I forget, sorry) cleared the previous record-length jump by a whopping six inches. So at the time, spectators and the athletes themselves could reasonably have expected to see a world-record jump that was maybe two or three or four inches longer than the previous world record.\n\nBeamon's jump was almost two *feet* longer than the previous world record. It was twenty-one and three-quarters inches.\n\nThat world record held for more than twenty years. Nobody jumped farther at all until 1991, and nobody's *ever* jumped farther at the Olympics. Beamon's performance was â¦Â words fail. \"Unprecedented\" doesn't cover it. Superlatives aren't up to the task. The best word I can think of to describe it is \"incomprehensible.\" If there hadn't been tens of thousands of eyewitnesses and a whole bunch of TV cameras rolling on it, literally no one would ever have been able to believe it had actually happened. It would've been dismissed as patently absurd, utterly impossible, a joke, a hoax or just a flat-out lie.\n\nBut it happened.\n\nClearly the human body is capable of more than we've ever seen. It's just really, really hard to reach those lofty heights. Beamon was hardly at the end of his athletic career when he landed that jump, but he still never again landed a jump that came within two feet of his 1968 performance. It was a fluke, a mystery, a one-time thing. But still something a person did, meaning it's something another person could, someday, do. At least in principle.\n\nIt's just really, really hard."},
{"title":"ELI5: Marx Theory of Social Change (NOT Communism)","answer":"It's basically two things: (1) all of history is the struggle between different groups to control the economy, and (2) real social change happens when a new group takes control.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, you have the kings and nobility both trying to control the wealth generated by the peasants.\n\nThen, with the growth of towns, you have merchants and artisans gaining power and wealth at the expense of rural landowners.\n\nThen as modern industry develops, factory owners at first struggle with the power of the monarchies and the guilds, but they gradually become the dominant force, and the kings and the guilds become insignificant in most cases. \n\nAnd as the factory owners dominate, the industrial working class struggles against oppression by them.  The industrial working class gradually becomes more and more politically organized and demands more and more economic concessions - until the point when the working class actually seizes power, which ends the class struggle once and for all."},
{"title":"Why are taxes and government spending considered \"bad\" for the economy? Isn't the government like a business with taxpayers as shareholders?","answer":"They're considered \"bad\", when they are, because as a general rule markets are efficient. And, as a general rule, government intervention is inefficient. The cause for that can be found in something like what the other people have said. That is, bureaucrats have an incentive to increase their budget and because they genuinely sincerely care about the issue they're in charge of they generally place more weight on it than the general public (or more weight than there \"should\" be). Politicians have incentives to provide their constituents with more things than they pay for, and so on. The incentives get all fucked up which leads to an inefficient market when government intervenes.\n\nThe proviso is that sometimes free market markets fail really badly. In those cases, the inefficient result with government intervention is better than the failure that was there. However there is a lot of disagreement about when those situations exist as opposed to situations where the market failure is better than the market failure due to government intervention.\n\nTo try to simplify:\n\nYes, but there are differences which cause the answer to be no. The biggest differences are:\n\n1. There is no \"profit\" one can measure when talking about the government. For example, one can't say that President Obama or President Bush was responsible for creating $X profit for the country. So success in the free market can't be measured the same way we measure success in government. Which means that there is disagreement about whether something is successful (or a good idea) or not.\n\n2. Government (more or less) can't go bankrupt or fail like a business can. This is sort of the flip side of #1. A government can do something like print money or borrow money. They're able to fuck up and recover from it, specifically a certain politician is able to fuck things up and recover from it. \n\nThe sidebar says no bias, so be prepared to know that I think what I'm saying is correct rather than biased; not everything criticizing a political party is necessarily biased. But know that it's my personal opinion. I think President Bush is an example of number 2. He was able to provide tax cuts, and money for wars, then finance the government through borrowing money. Basically after 2008 the situation was no longer his problem.\n\nAnd that's one of the problems with governments. Politicians make decisions based on what will get them re-elected rather than what is necessarily best for the people (however one might try to define that). Don't get me wrong, I'm about as liberal as they come, but that's the reality. Taking money out of what is generally efficient markets and putting it in generally inefficient markets is A) generally inevitable with the government and B) a general no-no. Plus people notice when they pay their taxes - sort of like how people bitch about gas prices even though it's relatively a little thing, it's something people are really aware of - and thus it's something people tend to talk or complain more about."},

{"title":"ELI5 Solvent Extraction (in chemistry)","answer":"Let's say you have two different substances dissolved in water.  How would you go about separating one from the other?  Well, what if you knew that substance A also dissolves extremely well in another liquid (e.g. hexane), but substance B doesn't?

After a whole bunch of shaking, let's say all of A is in the hexane, and all of B is in the water.  Then you can just separate the hexane from the water.  How do we do that?  Hexane and water are immiscible (they don't mix) similar to oil and water.  So the hexane, which contains your substance A will be floating on top.

{"title":"ELI5: Why can I see perfectly underwater with goggles when I have terrible vision normally? ","answer":"When light goes from one material into another material, it bends.  The amount it bends depends on the two materials.  You can observe this bend by filling up a glass of water, and submerging a pencil in it halfway.  The pencil will appear to be bent.  What's actually happening is that the light rays bend when they go from air into water, and from water into air.\n\nYour eyes are filled with a sort of jelly.  When you're on dry land, the light goes from air into that jelly, bending in the process.  Your eyes, however, are made to handle this, giving you perfect vision.\n\nWhen you open your eyes underwater, however, the light travels from *water* into the jelly in your eyes.  Because water is different from air, the light bends a different amount.  Your eye isn't made to handle this, and so the image falls in the wrong place on your retina, leading things to appear blurry.\n\nWhen you add goggles, the light is able to enter your eye from air, just like your eyes require.  It does bend a bit going from water into the air in the goggle, and you can observe this if you look carefully (your hand, for instance, may look a bit bigger or smaller than it normally would).\n\nBecause of this principle, if you wanted to design goggles for fish to use on land, they'd have to be filled with water!"},

{"title":"ELI5: Nuclear weapons","answer":"Oh good, a question I can answer. Take a seat, this is going to take a while.\n\nYou say you understand the idea of a nuclear chain reaction, but I'm going to cover it here in case anyone doesn't.\n\nSome kinds of atoms are unstable, especially the heavier ones (though lighter atoms like Technetium can be too). The atoms that we're interested in for this question are Uranium atoms, specifically Uranium-235. U^235 is fissile, which means that when it is hit by a neutron it splits into two smaller atoms, releasing a lot of energy and two more neutrons. These neutrons can then go on to two atoms, then four, then eight, and so on. The reaction grows faster and faster and produces an enormous amount of energy. The energy is released in the form of X-rays, Gamma rays, light, heat, etc.\n\n**Note for slightly more advanced readers:**\n\nThe reason so much energy is released by a nuclear reaction is that the mass of the two daughter atoms + neutrons is slightly less than the mass of the original U^235 atom. Explaining why this is the case gets into some really hairy quantum and particle physics that I'm not sure I understand well enough myself, so I'll leave it out. The salient point is that the missing mass (sometimes referred to as the Mass Defect) can be plugged into Einstein's famous formula e=mc^2. The energy produced (e) is equal to the mass defect (m) times the speed of light (c) squared. The speed of light squared is a huge number, so even a small amount of mass defect comes to a fairly large amount of energy. Those of you who remember high-school chemistry might be thinking this violates the Law of Conservation of Mass, and you'd be right. That law only applies to chemical reactions, not nuclear ones.\n**End Note**\n\nThe problem with this is that not every neutron produced by the reaction will hit a U^235 atom. This depends on the size of the piece of Uranium, impurities (like non-fissile U^238) and on the shape of the Uranium. A reaction in which, on average, less than one of the produced neutrons hits a U^235 atom is called sub-critical and will quickly run out of steam. If exactly one neutron per reaction hits U^235, the reaction is critical and will keep going on its own, not increasing or decreasing in power (by the way, Hollywood's beloved \"It's going critical!\" is a stupid thing to say - critical is the normal operating status for a nuclear reactor). Likewise, if more than one neutron hits a U^235 atom, the reaction is supercritical and is gaining power.\n\nIf we assume that our Uranium has a certain percentage of U^235 it's possible to calculate the size of a sphere which will sustain a critical reaction. The mass of this sphere is thus known as the critical mass.\n\nSo, to build a nuclear bomb, you want to have multiple pieces of Uranium which, separately, are far below the critical mass but which, when put together, form a super-critical mass. Or, more accurately, you want to go from very sub-critical to very super-critical very quickly. If you don't do it quickly enough, the reaction will produce enough energy to blow the bomb apart but not enough energy to cause the sort of city-shattering explosion people associate with nuclear bombs. By the somewhat odd standards of people who design nukes, this is called a \"fizzle.\"\n\nThe simplest way to do this is to have a big sphere of Uranium, and a gun that fires a small plug of uranium into a specially shaped hole. These don't work all that well; the gun has to be very powerful because the reaction can start before the plug reaches the sphere, causing the bomb to fizzle. Such a powerful gun is very large and heavy, making it difficult to use these bombs. Also, the addition of the small plug typically doesn't make the bomb very supercritical, so this type of bomb is usually rather weak and dirty. The Little Boy bomb dropped on Hiroshima was one of these.\n\nThe next way to do this is to use explosives to drive a set of Uranium wedges or cones together. This is called an implosion-type bomb. This is very complicated to do, since explosives blast outwards rather than inwards. They got around this by inventing the explosive lens; basically a carefully shaped piece of a slow explosive covered in a fast explosive; the slower explosive bends the explosion into a compressing sphere the same way a glass lens bends light. These tend to be more powerful than gun-type bombs (and consequently cleaner) but they're very difficult to build since the slightest imperfection in the implosion will cause the bomb to spray uranium dust all over the place instead of explode. The Fat Man bomb dropped on Nagasaki was one of these. The Fat Man used plutonium-239 rather than U^235, but the principle is the same.\n\nNow, it's really expensive to produce enough Uranium (or Plutonium) for one of these bombs. The bomb-designers realized that if they surrounded the core with a dense shell of U^238 (called a neutron reflector or tamper), they could reflect some of the escaping neutrons back in to have another go. This reduced the amount of uranium needed to make a bomb and, as a useful side effect, the inertia of the heavy U^238 holds the bomb together for an extra fraction of a second allowing the reaction to grow longer and produce more energy.\n\nAt this point we've basically reached the limit of what can be done with simple nuclear fission. These bombs are pretty powerful, but that wasn't good enough during the Cold War. So, to get more bang, bomb designers started looking elsewhere.\n\nWhat they came up with was the fusion-boosted bomb. They reasoned that if they put a container of Tritium or Deuterium (some designs also used various isotopes of Helium) next to the bomb when it went off, the powerful X-rays produced by the fission reaction would cause the Deuterium to fuse together to produce a heavier atom, releasing even more energy than fission (see note above for why) and even more neutrons. The neutrons then blasted back into the exploding remnants of the Uranium core and caused them to fission some more. Also, the normally non-fissile U^238 tamper can become fissile in such extreme circumstances, adding even more energy to the blast. Most of the energy of a fusion-boosted bomb actually comes from the third-stage fission of the core debris and the tamper, not the fusion. This is how the arms race went from the 16 and 21 kiloton bombs dropped on Japan to the 16 megaton Castle Bravo test device that unexpetedly blasted a mile-and-a-half crater out of Bikini Atoll in 1954 and the 50 megaton Tsar Bomba that Russia test-detonated over Novaya Zemlya in 1961.\n\nBy now people kind of agreed that that was enough, that you reach a point where a single bomb can level an entire city and there's not a lot of point going bigger than that. So they started figuring out ways to nuke multiple cities with just one missile, but that's something for another day.\n\nFinally, a short explanation of how the bomb produces such destruction. The heat directly produced by the reaction is only a fairly small amount of the energy - most of it escapes in the form of X-rays, Gamma rays, Alpha and Beta particles, stray neutrons, etc. All of this radiation shines out into the nearby air, instantly heating it to many thousands of degrees and causing it to expand rapidly, producing a powerful pressure wave.\n\nTvtropes has a good page on the effects of a nuclear bomb [here](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeadliestMushroom), if you're still interested after that wall o'text."},

{"title":"ELI5 what the marginal tax rate is","answer":"Lots of people think the income tax rate works like this. You pay a percentage of your income, determined by how rich you are. Richer people have a higher rate. Right?\n\n*WRONG.* Erase that from your mind. It's not true at all.\n\nWhat actually happens is this. The first $8700 of your income is taxed at 10%. Then the *next* chunk of your income, up to about 35k or so, is taxed at 15%. You do not pay 15% on the original $8700; that stays at the 10% rate it had before you made more money.\n\nWhy do we have that complicated system? Well, it fixes a very important flaw. If tax rates are absolute, you end up with situations where people will lose money by increasing their income. By earning 1 dollar more and putting myself into the next tax bracket, I would pay X% more on *all* of my money, and end up losing out. Marginal tax rates fix this."},
{"title":"ELI15: How does the Federal Reserve set interest rates?","question_detail":"I understand that:\n\n- The Fed gets to decide how much money it has (it is effectively the source of dollars).\n\n- Money enters the economy from the Fed when the Fed buys bonds, and pays for those bonds with money from its account.\n\n- By merely announcing what the new interest rate target is, the Fed almost makes it so, because everyone knows that it *can* make it so by buying or selling enough bonds (since the Fed has unlimited money), so people start using the new interest rates.\n\nBut... how exactly is it that the Fed's bond buying or selling activity changes interest rates?  If people didn't just listen to its announcements and it had to act under the radar, presumably it could still move rates to the target it sets, but what's the mechanism by which it buying or selling bonds translates to a different short term interest rate?\n","answer":"The fed \"sets\" the interest rate by changing the amount of money available in the country. The more money, the lower the interest rate, and the less money, the higher the interest rate. So when they say they've set the interest rate, they've actually changed the total amount of money in the economy."},

Why would they work/ not work?","question_detail":"I've heard him say it over and over in the debates, and I honestly don't understand why there are so many, nor do I understand what they are.  \n\nThanks!","answer":"Right, here we go.  Full disclosure: I'm a liberal, so I may be biased, despite trying not to be.\n\nAs far as I know, Romney has only one \"five-point plan\" that he talks about regularly.  He does say it a whole lot, though, so I could see how you'd get confused and think he has several.  Romney's \"five-point plan\" is what he proposes to fix the economy.  In it, he proposes:\n\n- Cut income tax rates for all taxpayers by 20%\n- Keep the tax rates the same for interest, dividends, and capital gains.  These are all investments, ways to grow money over time, and they are mainly used by businesses and the wealthy.\n- Eliminate taxes on interest, dividends, and capital gains for those making less than $200,000 per year.  The goal is to encourage people to invest.\n- Eliminate the estate tax, or \"death tax,\" as he calls it.  This is a tax on inheritances valued over $5,000,000.  As you'd expect, it effects a very small portion of high-earning taxpayers.\n- Repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT).  This is actually not a bad idea.  Basically, the AMT is a higher income tax rate with fewer exemptions that was originally designed to keep the super-rich from avoiding the income tax by using various loopholes.  But, the AMT hasn't kept up with inflation, meaning that more and more people in the middle class have to pay it every year.  Currently, if you make over $48,450 as a single person or $74,450 as a married couple, you have to pay the higher AMT rates.  Not exactly taxing the Rockefellers.\n- He also wants to lower the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 25% and repeal the Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\") and the small taxes included in it.  These two aren't part of the five-point plan on his tax page, though.\n\nSo, that's the plan.  Now, on to why it won't work.  All of my figures are from a recent study by the Tax Policy Center, a very well-respected research group that the Romney campaign has cited as recently as two days ago.  \n\nAccording to the study, which draws on Congressional Budget Office estimates, all of these cuts would result in a loss of $456 billion in government revenue, or $4.56 trillion over the standard 10-year budget period; the $480 billion figure being thrown about is from an earlier TPC study that did not include adjustments for certain market behaviors. Romney plans to offset that revenue loss by eliminating loopholes and deductions in the tax code.\n\nThe TPC cut every tax deduction they could, starting from the top of the income scale and moving down. They calculated that roughly 65% of all available tax expenditures - things that people use to pay less tax - would have to be cut, including, but not limited to, the mortgage interest deduction, employer-provided health insurance deduction, state and local tax exclusions, deductions for charitable contributions, and benefits for low- to middle-class families such as the child tax credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Apart from the fact that these deductions are extremely popular, and therefore very difficult to repeal, they mainly benefit the low and middle class. That means that high-income earners would receive a bigger tax break than lower-income earners, the exact opposite of what you want in our progressive tax system.\n\nWhen the TPC crunched the numbers, they found that those making less than $200,000 per year - roughly 95% of taxpayers - would end up with after-tax incomes about 1.2% lower than under current policy. Those making $200,000 and up, however - the top 5 percent of taxpayers - would see their after-tax incomes go up by at least 0.8%, going higher with income. Those making over $1,000,000 would see an after-tax income increase of 4.3%. In effect, Romney's tax plan would shift roughly $86 billion of the tax burden from those making over $200,000 to those making less than $200,000. Note that all of these numbers assume that all of those very politically popular exclusions and deductions are removed completely; if they are not, the program would shift even more of the burden to the middle class.\n\nSo, according to math, there is no way for Romney to pay for his tax plan without shifting a significant part of the tax burden from the wealthiest of Americans to those earning less. There simply aren't enough exemptions to eliminate. Beyond that, Romney plans to add $2 trillion to military spending, and to make the Bush-era tax cuts permanent, another $1 trillion.  Unless the Governor is some kind of wizard who can alter the very laws of mathematics and finance, his plan simply will not work.\n\n**TL; DR: Romney's five-point plan wants to cut a lot of taxes, but the math says he can't pay for it.**"},

But we can't always see all of that half from earth.  \n\nWhen the moon is between us and the sun, we can't see the lit half at all because it's on the other side.  That's called a new moon.  When we are between the sun and the moon, we can see all of the lit half.  That's a full moon.  Between these two we can only see part of the lit half and we see a crescent moon.  It takes about a month for the moon to do a full turn around us, so that's why the lunar phases operate on a roughly monthly cycle.\n\nNow the orbit of the moon is not exactly aligned with our orbit around the sun.  So when we're between the moon and the sun, we don't always cast a shadow on the moon: sometimes the moon passes over or under our shadow.  When it goes through our shadow, that's a lunar eclipse.

Globalisation has been excellent for America in some ways, and catastrophic for China and India in other ways. It's an ever-changing phenomenon that has a big list of pros and cons for every country involved. \n\nYou could argue that it might take away American jobs, but globalisation (which America has pushed for more ruthlessly than anyone else) has also helped to make America the country it is today. Globalisation has satisfied America's never-ending thirst for consumption and cheap non-durable goods. It's also allowed America to manipulate the global economy and maintain economic power over nations through avenues such as the IMF and the World Bank. Many suggest that the UN is one of the biggest by-products of globalisation, and that America has benefited greatly from being central to UN policy and decision making. \n\nConversely, whilst many would suggest globalisation has grown the economies of India and China to unprecedented heights, the affect of their increased manufacturing industries has had enormous social and environment consequences.

{"title":"What is the difference between Dopamine, Endorphins & Serotonin...and how are they used by your body/brain?","answer":"These are all different chemicals your brain puts out to get the body to feel a certain way. \r\rSerotonin is a chemical that makes you relaxed, and makes the body tired and sleepy. I'm pretty sure this is so that the body knows when to shut down for sleep so it doesn't burn out. People who have sleeping problems sometimes have problems with the way their brains either make or take in serotonin.\r\rEndorphins are put out to give a pleasing rush of feelings under physical or mental stress. I believe this is sort of of like adrenaline in that it helps to override pain. This gives a feeling of wellness in the body to promote this action again. This is why people enjoy working out or doing sports. Some people who have problems with this chemical can get pain and pleasure mixed up, and will hurt themselves because it feels good.\r\rDopamine gives you that pure rush that, when you get old enough, one day you will feel during sex. It also comes from lots of other things, like a good movie or video game, or anything you enjoy doing and makes you want to do it more. Drugs also flood our brains with this chemical, and makes us feel really good. But in order to balance it out, our brains make more of the \"ports\" that receive dopamine. And when we aren't taking any drugs, there aren't near enough chemicals released to fill the ports up, which makes us feel terrible. That's part of why withdrawal feels so bad for drug addicts."},

{"title":"ELI5: The big bang","question_detail":"Please explain how it happened and what it did. Thanks!","answer":"At the point of the big bang, the universe was infinitely small and infinitely dense, which then rapidly expanded into the current universe (the expansion is still going). Our laws of science don't work with infinite densities, so the instant of the big bang is known as a singularity. Because science breaks down at the singularity, nothing that happened after it can give us any information about what came before, and nothing that came before has any effect on what happened after it. You can think of a singularity as basically a wall that cause and effect can't get through. Because of this, we can't really expect to ever explain what set up the conditions for the big bang or maybe even what caused it to happen.\n\nRecently, newer theories like string theory and supergravity have brought up the possibility that in the 4 dimensions we're familiar with, 3 space and 1 time, the universe could be finite but without boundaries, meaning there is no concept of before the big bang, because that would be a boundary. A good way to imagine how something can be finite but have no boundaries is to think of the Earth's surface in 2 dimensions. It's finite, but curves around in the 3rd dimensions such that there are no boundaries. Our 4-dimensional universe may be similarly curved in higher dimensions.\n\nIs that the kind of answer you were looking for?"},
{"title":"ELI5: IPV6","answer":"How would you like it to always have to call a phone exchange and ask for the person you want to talk to instead of calling him directly? How about if the phone exchange often don't even know how to pass your call on so that you have to get your friend to call to the same service you are calling so they can let you talk?\n\nWell, that's the situation NAT for IPv4 has created, and as IPv4 has a limit of the number of addresses (like phone numbers) that is running out, the easy way to allow direct connections between devices is to switch to IPv6 and drop NAT as IPv6 has longer addresses.\n\nAnd that's not all, IPv6 has also fixed a number of issues in IPv4 (some security related, and more).\n\nSo, where did IPv5 go? It was just an experimental protocol."},
{"title":"Why exactly does the brain die within only a few minutes of going without oxygen?","question_detail":"What exactly is \"dying\" when the brain no longer has oxygen, and why does it happen so fast?","answer":"Your brain, just like any other organ in your body (but even more so), is highly dependent on oxygen for metabolism. It all comes back to the [Krebb or citric acid cycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid_cycle), which takes oxygen and a carbohydrate to make energy and carbon dioxide.\n\nThe brain is *incredibly* energy intensive and uses about 20% of the body's oxygen and 25% of the body's glucose (sugar). Even really slight changes in either of those causes a rapid change in condition.\n\nWhen the body doesn't get enough oxygen, acids are formed from **an**aerobic metabolism (that burning sensation you get when working out). Your brain cells are particularly sensitive to those acids and will die off."},
{"title":"ELI5: Why is adoption so expensive?","answer":"Lawyers.  :)\n\nJoking aside, the law takes parental rights *very* seriously, and tries to afford biological parents every opportunity to maintain custody of their children.  So terminating those rights in such a way they can't change their minds later requires a lot of legal work.\n\nIf it were only that, it might only cost a few thousand dollars.  But you also have the overhead of the adoption agency.  They perform background checks then search for a suitable child.  If that child is in high demand (like a healthy, white newborn), the search can take a lot of time and effort, which costs money."},
{"title":"ELI5: CD Key Websites","question_detail":"There're websites that you can buy just a CD key from. Once you've obtained the CD key, you unlock the game in Steam or Origin.

That seems like too good of a deal, like something isn't quite right.\n\nMy question is manifold: Is this legal? Is this ethical/moral? How do these sites acquire these keys? How much of my money goes to the people that actually made the game in question?","answer":"Reputable CD keys sites will use their more powerful currency to buy video games through countries where they'll simply be cheaper.  The sites then have them shipped to a large storage building, where they sell them for cheap because a $20 game + $10 shipping = $30 worth of cushion for them to sell.  It's legal for you to buy; unethical, immoral?  Probably."},
{"title":"How is it that we have pure substances","question_detail":"How can we have pure substances like pure carbon? Wouldn't the atoms of everything that it touches and the elements in the air doesn't change it into anything else","answer":"1. As buzzzhoward said, elements are typically not pure for the exact reason that you said.  Noble gases are generally an exception, due to their full electron shells - in fact, they're usually so unlikely to form componds that argon fluorohydride, the first known argon-containing compound, was only discovered 12 years ago.  Additionally, pure samples of elements will occasionally form - you will get traces of pure carbon in a candle flame, for example.\n\n2. As Xethaios said, elements don't just react with whatever - you need energy, a catalyst, etc. to get a lot of chemical reactions to occur at anything more than a slow rate, so a sample of something is likely to remain relatively pure for a while.  Of course, it's highly unlikely that this will remain the case indefinitely, especially if an element is highly reactive - iron will rust, for example (by forming iron oxides with the fairly reactive oxygen), and copper will turn green by forming copper chlorides (this is why the Statue of Liberty is green - chlorine is reactive as hell).\n\n3. My own addition: Elements will generally be pure if the atoms in the sample in question are all able to bond together, with no free bonding electrons remaining.  This is what happens with a lot of the gases in our atmosphere, e.g. oxygen (which will form dioxygen/breathable oxygen, or sometimes ozone/trioxygen), but is also why you get different forms (or allotropes) of the same pure element.  For example, carbon can take on various forms depending on how the atoms bond together, as you can see [here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Eight_Allotropes_of_Carbon.png) - the most well-known ones here are diamond (a), graphite (b), buckminsterfullerene (d), and a single-walled carbon nanotube (h)."},

Even if I got little/poor sleep the night before, I don't require much nap time to get going again.","answer":"It depends when you wake up from long sleep. You probably know your sleep has phases, and depending on which phase you are in when you wake up you will feel more/less rested. You'll see this if you take too long of a power nap, you end up waking more tired than when you laid down. \n\n\nMy question is why, despite being on a fairly regular sleep schedule (same time asleep/wake up 6 days a week), on the day I don't have an alarm set I sleep for 12 hours?

{"title":"ELI5: Why is computer memory always measured by base 2? Is there any reason we have 1024 bytes to a kilo as opposed to 1000?","answer":"Reason for binary:\n\nComputers are built on electrical circuits. If you don't want the circuit to behave the same way every single time, you have a switch. Often, you run electricity through the switch to represent 'yes', 'true' or '1' - and then you cut the electricity to represent 'no', 'false' or '0'.\n\nWith a binary or base 2 switch you can ask the simple question: \"Is power running through the switch?\" and there are only two possible answers. Base 2.\n\nWith a base 10 system you'd have to ask a much more complicated question, which would be far more expensive to build and then things would be too pricey.\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5 Infinite Density.","question_detail":"Some Theoretical Physicists believe that just before the big bang, the universe was, among other things, infinitely dense.  I can understand how a 1 inch square block of lead has more density than a piece of wood of the same size but can someone, using simple words, explain infinite density?","answer":"To really understand science, you have to understand that it isn't exact.  It tries to be.  It pretends to be as long as it gives useful insights.  But all science is an approximation for reality.  (the only way to model the universe to its final detail is to build a computer that is the universe).\n\nScientists create models simpler than reality to try to figure out what happened in terms we can understand, without sacrificing the details we need.\n\nIf you want to study the origins of the universe, do you really need to know where every atom of every planet of every star system is? or can you generalize it?\n\nThe basic universal model assumes the universe is uniform, its an average universe where there are no planets, just uniform \"dust\".  It has the same mass and same average density as the real universe, but because it is the same dust everywhere, we can figure out what happens.\n\nHowever, whenever a model is created, you have to be aware of where the edges of your model are.  The places where the model, its assumptions, and simplifications break down.  Where this happens you might get paradoxes and contradictions -- symptoms of something going really wrong.  But of course it isn't anything wrong with the universe, science only tries to explain what the universe IS, it doesn't tell the universe what to BE.  Instead the model must be wrong somehow -- or incomplete or overly simple.\n\nThat is what is happening with the \"infinite density\".  If you assume the universe is a finite sphere with average density dust everywhere and that it is expanding, then if you reverse the model all that dust will come into one point of zero volume but finite mass -- it will be infinitely dense.\n\nIs this bad?  Not really, not as long as you remember that our model is limited.\n\nIs it wrong?  Maybe yes, maybe no.  Maybe this 'infinite density' does relate to something real, something we don't understand yet.  Maybe we can create some sort of theory from it, explaining how an infinitely dense point exploded with a large bangish type sound and made the universe.\n\nOr maybe it is wrong, and the model is missing something. The universe never was or never could have a point of infinite density, only hellalarge density that our model doesn't account for.\n\n--Maybe the model is wrong to assume that space is continuous, perhaps it is discrete at the smallest planck lengths and times (ie: the universe is naturally 'pixelated' with a certain maximum resolution that sets a maximum density as well).\n\n--Maybe the laws of physics we use change over time, or differ from place to place in ways not accounted for with our model.\n\n--Maybe the universe didn't have a beginning, it rebounded from a previous 'universe' that crunched into a nearly infinite density point and bounced back.\n\n--Maybe there are other particles and forces we haven't accounted for.  Maybe the the 'bang' is a glitch formed when another universe in another dimension made ours.  Maybe universes give birth to each other.  Maybe time travel was involved.  Or aliens. Or time travelling aliens who all wear rubber forehead masks to fit in with the cool beings.\n\nMaybe we'll figure out the true answer one day by looking at all these strange things and asking if we can, using simple words, explain them."},

{"title":"Why do some people believe in genuine free will?","question_detail":"I'm not talking about making a choice from right or wrong and acting on those decisions. I'm not even talking about something simple as driving to work or biking. I'm talking about GENUINE free will in it's simplest form. From the beginning of time, every single action has had a reaction. If one atom was in a different location or acted with another particle a fraction of a second later or earlier than it did, there would be a different universe that what there is today.\n\n It's like a snowball effect, one meteor hits another, which hits another, and so on. It's easy to understand this method for example because you can see it happen in any experiment. Place a bunch of marbles in a circle and fling one and see the chain of reactions. Imagine each person as a separate marble now and apply that to the universe. How are we any different from the meteors that hit each other? We are both creations of the same place and time, just only many years after. \n\nThe difference is consciousness and the ability to reflect upon ourselves. Just because we are capable of identifying ourselves does not mean we no longer abide by nature. I like to view it as this; if I was to hit my left hand on my desk, then every single action for the last 13.7 billion years was leading up to it and the cause of it. People who think there's such a thing as free will might say \"huh, ok. I'll prove nature wrong and hit my right hand on the desk instead\". But every single action from the beginning of time has made you come to that conclusion and hit your right hand instead.\n\nAll I'm saying is that in the end, we are just a part of what was, is, and always will be. We are just \"lucky\" (if you believe that there was any other way this would happen) to have the capability of reflecting upon ourselves both individually and universally. This isn't an excuse to always say \"it was meant to be\" when there's something to learn from those situations but it is something interesting to think about. I think that people who refuse such theories are those that don't want to give up their sense of control. Do you believe in this or not? And if not, why?","answer":"So you seem to have free will defined as \"Some action that cannot be predicted\". Since you can predict me hitting my right hand, me hitting my right hand isn't an expression of free will.\n\nWhat would happen if we examined the universe and we found that we actually weren't able to predict what hand people were hitting? Going further than that, what if we developed a very sophisticated set of laws that predict the world around us, however those laws tell us that some things in the universe simply could not be predicted (hitting right vs left hands being one of them)? Would this mean free will actually *does* exist?\n\nNow for a different line of reasoning: Lets say we create a computer that can predict with 100% accuracy what hand I will hit. Now lets put that computer in the same room as me and have it display its prediction. It suddenly will not be able to predict what hand I hit (I just won't hit the hand it displays). What does this mean about free will? Maybe you'll say \"Sure that computer suddenly loses it's ability to predict, but some other computer sitting outside of the room would be able to predict everything.\" We can treat the first computer and me (the one hitting the hands) as a single system that can be predicted. However, any time we make that predicting agent a part of the system it's trying to predict, that ability to predict absolutely disappears. This means humans will never be able to fully predict the universe around us because we are a part of the system we're trying to predict. \n\nHow does this change your understanding of free will?"},

{"title":"ELI5: BRCA2's relation to breast cancer","question_detail":"What is the chemical make up of it?\n\nHow can I search more into it?\n\nIs pubmed reliable?\n","answer":"Ok.  BRCA2 isn't really a tangible thing.  It's a gene, or a blueprint, that allows the body to make a specific protein.  So its make-up is the same as all the other DNA in the body - sugar, phosphate, nitrogenous base.  The specific protein made by BRCA2 is a tumor suppressor protein (there are many).  It helps to repair DNA damage.  So if this BRCA2 gene is lost or mutated, the body can no longer make the protein, so the damaged DNA will not be repaired.  Accumulation of mutated DNA can lead to malignancy.  "},

","answer":"I think the point you may be missing is that it is possible to draw three overlapping circles on a plane with multiple points of intersection. But if there is *any* point where all three circles intersect, then there is *only one* such point.   Try it.   That's why it is called **tri**angulation...it takes three.  \n  \nWith cell phone triangulation, the diameter of each circle can be approximated by using the power required to send the radio signals to the phone from each different tower. \n  \n(Of course, when you are doing it on the surface of the Earth you are not dealing with an actual plane but instead with the surface of a spheroid, but for the purposes of cell phone triangulation it doesn't matter.

{"title":"ELI5: how does body hair know at what length to stop growing?","answer":"Okay, so each each hair is made by a thing called a hair follicle. The hair follicle produces hair for a certain length of time, say a week, before taking a rest for a while and then starting to make hair again. When it's producing hair, the hair gets longer! When it's taking a rest, the hair usually falls out. So you can see, the hair would get longer and reach a certain length before falling out, and this length would normally be the same each time.\n\nWhy doesn't all your hair fall out after a week?

The small sample has a box attached to their TVs that records exactly what they're watching.   The diaries serve a similar purpose.  They then estimate what one percentage point of viewers would be.  Currently, it's in the neighborhood fo 1.2 million.  They then bracket the viewership by age, and publish the 18-49, the most important measure for advertisers.  They get the share that viewed/share with TVs turned on.  They also give you a total viewership count, which tends to be higher than the amount assumed by the ratings share.  \n\nIt comes under a lot of fire because it neglects digital viewership, and people are concerned that the sample isn't entirely representative.

{"title":"ELI5: How do computers work?","question_detail":"EDIT: Wow, thanks for the explanations. You really helped me out here.","answer":"afcagroo explained the hardware-side of how a computer works.  Now I will attempt to explain the software-side of how a computer works.  If you're not clear on what hardware and software is, hardware is the physical pc that you buy (motherboard, graphics card, CPU, processor) and software is the program(s) you run that control the hardware and make it useful.\n\n\nAt the lowest level, to run the hardware there is something called the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System).  The BIOS is a type of firmware (minimum software for a device to be useable) installed on all computers by the manufacturer of the PC.  I don't want to talk about the BIOS too much, but it is a non-volatile memory usually stored on a ROM chip located on the motherboard.  Non-volatile means the memory is retained even if the computer is powered off, and ROM means read-only memory.\n\n\nOn the next level, there is something called an operating system (OS).  The operating system is software but it is a collection of many softwares/programs.  The intention of an operating system is to give a common framework to many computers so that programs can be programmed to run on many different computers at once instead of each individual one.  The user of a computer can decide which operating system they want to use.  The three most common operating systems on PCs today are Windows, Mac, and Linux.\n\n\nWith a BIOS and an Operating System, you can begin to download 3rd-party software (software not made by the PC manufacturer nor by the creator of your OS) and install it on your computer.  Such programs include Flash, Java, video games, writing applications like Microsoft word, web browsers like Firefox and Chrome, music management programs like iTunes and Winamp, and pretty much everything else you see on your computer.\n\n\nNow for a tangent, the question \"How do computers work?\" is general and so now that hardware and software have been covered, there's only one thing people usually ask about.  How are computers only 1's and 0's??  Well that question kind of gaps both hardware and software.  The first thing to note is that 1's and 0's aren't all computers use to make sense of things â they also group those 1's and 0's together to form meaningful pieces of information.  A single \"switch\" â a single transistor that can be a 1 or a 0 (on or off) in a computer is referred to as a bit in binary (binary is the number scheme computers use, more on that later).  A group of 8 bits is called a byte, and bytes are more what computers use to make sense of things.  Each operating system interprets a collection of bytes (or a program) differently, which is why programs are often OS-specific; they need to be modified to run on another operating system (except for Java programs).  For instance, the letter A in binary code is  0100 0001 (notice 8 bits = 1 byte) and letters are common between operating systems because of an agreed upon table of binary/letter conversions called ASCII (UNICODE is an alternative capable of non-American letters or characters).\n\n\nSo hopefully that was a good enough overview for you.  The last point I want to make is WHY computers use binary.  It is actually not so bad of a deal, as binary is very efficient and simple.  But the reason we're forced to use it is because at the end of the day, all the data you want to store and process when you turn on a computer has to go through transistors and the only reliable way to manipulate transistors is to either have electric current flowing through them or not, hence the on and off or the 1 and the 0.  This might not be the case in the future as quantum computers are in the works and they can have MULTIPLE reliable states.  Instead of a 1 or a 0, they might have 9 through 0 for a total of 10 states.  Lastly, it has been mathematically proven that you can use binary and the three logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) to represent any logical statement, therefore binary is the easiest system for us to use and it will work 100% of the time.

{"title":"ELI5: why many people want the wealthy to pay more taxes","answer":"It was explained to me as the inverse.  It's not that we want the wealthy to pay more, rather it's that we want the poor to pay less.  The justification is that we want tax to make up a set percentage of disposable income.  The poor spend a higher percentage of their income on basic survival and therefore tax should not eat into that.  \n\nAs an example.  Lets take 2 people, one who makes $10 and one who makes $20. Basic survival might include things like food, basic shelter, heat ect.  Comes in at a total cost of $7, a person can choose to spend more and they eat better food, or live in a better home in a nicer part of town but $7 is the minimum not to be starving/homeless. assuming a flat tax rate of 15% the poor person pays 50% [(10*.15)/(10-7)] of his disposable income in tax while the wealthy person pays only 23% [(20*.15)/(20-7)].  The government earns $4.5\n\nA system that is more fair is to say, 0% on income under $7, 28.13% on income over.  If you do the math, the government earns the same amount.  and both rich and poor pay the same % on disposable income.  The problem is that the wealthy look at this system and say \"he only pays $0.84 while I pay $3.66, why is that fucking fair! I work harder than he does, I should pay the same amount!\"  \n\nWhile a marginal system appears unfair in absolute dollar amounts, the opposite is a system that is unfair in percentages of disposable income.  The system we have is a marginal one, however it has more than 2 levels.  \n\nOne of the BIG problems with the current tax system is that there are deductions and credits that should be available to everyone, but the system is SO complex that only the wealthy can afford to change spending patterns (and hire an accountant) to take advantage of them.  A person struggling to pay for food is not going put money into an RRSP (401K in the US, I think) for the tax deduction, they just can't afford it.\n\nIncreasing the rate on the wealthy is a way of compensating for this.  While the wealthy argue that they already pay \"their fair share\" the fact is that they have 1,000% more disposable income than the average poor person. \n\nMost wealthy people spend a fixed amount of money per year, any additional profit over that amount goes into savings.  The economy is built on consumer spending, not saving. despite what wall street would have you believe, they do not create jobs, consumers do.  That's why they freak out about consumer spending predictions. Therefore moving that money into the hands of the poor (who will spend it, not save it) is of greater net benefit to the economy. "},

For a function describing something, the first derivative defines the rate of change of that something, and the second derivative represents the rate of acceleration (or rate of change of the rate of change). \n\nThe most apparent use is the study of moving objects in math or physics, but also can be used examine, say, growth trends, or a multitude of applications in finance/economics.\n\nFinally, wherever a function has a minimum or maximum, the derivative will be zero (ie, flat).

The most I know is that he supports Castro and expropriation, but are there any other things I'm not aware of? im asking because i know of the vast knowledge of reddit and i know there is someone out there that knows about his","answer":"Chavez is basically your kid that runs for school presidency, promises a lot of candy which is addictive and then keeps on supplying just enough so you don't revolt.\n\nHere's a couple comments I wrote awhile back before 7-O:\n\n&gt;&gt;Ah, sorry, I inferred your meaning incorrectly. It's funny - if Venezuela gets mentioned at all on the news, you almost never get to hear from Venezuelans. If Capriles won the election (assuming there are still elections) do you think Chavez would give up power?\n\n&gt;We ... don't know.\n\n&gt;Chavez is a soldier. He attempted a [coup d'etat back in February 4th, 1992](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Venezuelan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat_attempts); a bloody coup at that. He failed then but ultimately succeeded later on: then-president Carlos Andres PÃ©rez was apprehended, [impeached](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Andres_Perez#Impeachment) and tried on embezzlement charges (250 million bolivares. A *major fuckton* of money). Later on in 2001 he exiled himself after being persecuted by the current regime and died on self-imposed exile. All of this was to break the status quo caused by the[ Punto Fijo Pact](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punto_Fijo_Pact) (supposed to last 1 term, but developed into a bipartite system).\n\n&gt;In 2002 [a coup d'etat was attempted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Venezuelan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat_attempt). Some people will say it wasn't a coup but by all means it is: he was forcefully removed from power and returned 2 days later. Later that year, he survived a general strike lasting from December 2002 through February 2003. Fuel was scarcely found, there wasn't as much food available as before but it could be found. He managed to survive it and it tempered his temper.\n\n&gt;These two events deeply affected him and fired up his \"socialism machine\". He was not a socialist when he won his first election. He started to get close with socialist and communist countries (Cuba, China, Russia, etc...) and decided to start, well, everything he's done up to this day (that's a debate for another topic).\n\n&gt;The point is, the people are *used* to their current lifestyle. A lot of people want change, but a lot of people would rather things remain the same. Nobody likes to be home at 6 pm for fear of being robbed, or shot then robbed which is likelier (I'm dead serious). Nobody likes having to go downtown to the dangerous areas to buy clothing, food, school implements, etc... with worn-out or torn clothing to appear \"poor\" to avoid what I mentioned before.\n\n&gt;Nobody likes fearing for their life each time they leave their home or come back to it. But \"a known evil is better than an unknown good\". It's a belief deeply held in the heart of Venezuelans which has been slowly, steadily changing for the better. So damned *slowly*, but changing. \n\n&gt;Kids born since 1998 have never known a different president, a different way of doing things, a different view on life, healthcare, education, politics, etc... People who never had anything now have things: social healthcare, education, employment. This is something we have to recognize, he wanted to raise up the poor ... to a certain limit, so as to prevent them from becoming a threat to his power, while lowering the rich down to their level. He succeeded just as much as he wanted to, enough to keep them wanting more but without rebelling, thus making the population *depend* on him to make do.\n\n&gt;These things I've told you make uncertain whether or not he'll peacefully give up the power if Henrique Capriles Radonski wins. Some say he'll flee the country a-lÃ¡ \"each man for its own\". Some say he'll use the militia [he's been arming](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADQslP24ths&amp;feature=related) (La Piedrita, Tupamaros, Carapaica(?)) to create chaos along with the generals he's favoured to inflict a self-coup and keep power. Some say he'll declare the elections invalid, dissolve the National Assembly and other kind of crazy, inane stuff.\n\n&gt;Now you're thinking \"wait, why isn't people saying anything about him giving up the power peacefully?\". I say: [this is why (read on)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJvdlS5MaaQ). Before you watch the video, which I was lucky to find subtitled, you need some background (as if it wasn't enough already :P). \n\n&gt;In 2007 there was [a referendum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_constitutional_referendum,_2007) whose main purpose was indefinite re-election, previously limited to two terms. It was camouflaged within social reforms so people who dashed straight to the Yes/No box or couldn't read didn't know about it. Think of it as the 2012 NDAA budget and the indefinite detention clause. Chavez lost it, but later in 2009 he impulsed [another referendum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_constitutional_referendum,_2009) abolishing all term limits for *all positions*, effectively perpetuating anyone that managed to \"win\" the elections over and over again. But I disgress; watch the video now: it's his reaction after losing the referendum. Watch how much vitriol he spews, how much hate he vociferates, how ... butthurt he is :P\n\n&gt;And here we are, at last: we are unsure how things after 7-O will end up. We really don't know.\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/10xsge/fixing_a_pipe_in_venezuela/c6ht4q4\n\n&gt;&gt;How can ANYONE support a government where you have to put your kids in private school for them to have a decent education?\n\n&gt;I'm gonna have to side with the gov't for a bit this time because it's the right thing to do.\n\n&gt;This is a problem that has been going on since way before Chavez, back to the first governments after the Punto Fijo Pact. Near-weekly teacher strikes, poorly (if at all) equipped public schools and too few. How can you have a decent education like that? It's almost impossible. \n\n&gt;The poverty that is rampant in Venezuela albeit smaller nowadays makes it impossible for a large chunk of population to educate their children if they can't send them to private schools.\n\n&gt;But then you have another problem with public schools: public schools + social/communist government = brainwashing. Like it or not, the only way to make sure the new generations remain \"loyal\" to the government's ideologies is to educate them like so.\n\n&gt;That's why almost everyone who can afford it sends their children to private schools.\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/10tns3/in_5_days_there_will_be_elections_in_venezuela_i/c6hvlta\n\nEDIT: Just for kicks and giggles, here's a rather interesting tid-bit about the electoral process in Venezuela:\n\n&gt;Heh.\n\n&gt;&gt;Bro, I think the last line wasn't necessary. How am I going to lie when the results are online and can be consulted by anyone?\n\n&gt;True, that's correct, the results are online. Except *some* of them are not the ones you posted.\n\n&gt;[2006 Presidential elections](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elecci%C3%B3n_Presidencial_de_Venezuela_\\(2006\\)).\n\n&gt;&gt; In 2006, Presidential elections were voted by 11.790.397. \n\n&gt;[2010 Parlamentary elections](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elecciones_parlamentarias_de_Venezuela_de_2010). \n\n&gt;&gt;In 2010, for the National Assembly elections, 4 years later, were the number of voters should've increased, number total of voters was 11.097.667.\n\n&gt;In both cases you are correct, that's the tally. *But*\n\n&gt;&gt;Yes, the last elections were a little confusing for the actual amount of votes for each party. Guided for the election of the \"Parlatino\" the number of votes for the officialism was 5.268.939 and for the opposition 5.077.043.\n\n&gt;Those aren't the actual votes I asked for, sorry. I asked for the National Assembly votes, not the Latinoamerican Parliament (which are those you provided). From Wikipedia:\n\n&gt;|Party| Votes      | % of votes |  Seats \n|:-|-:|-:|:-:|\n|PSUV | 5,423,324 | 48.13% | 98 \n|MUD  | 5,320,364 | 47.22% | 65 \n|PPT   |   353,979 |   3.14% |   2\n|**Total**||\n||11.097.667 | 98.49% |  165\n\n&gt;These are the results from the 2010 Parlamentary elections. The percentages are wrong though. The correct percentages are\n\n&gt;|Party | Votes      |  % of votes   |  Seats \n|:-|-:|-:|:-:|\n|PSUV| 5,423,324 | 48.8690460797% | 98 \n|MUD | 5,320,364 | 47.9412835148% | 65 \n|PPT  |   353,979\t |  3.1896704055%  |\t2\n|**Total**||\n||11.097.667 | 100.00% |  165\n\n&gt;Now here's the thing: PSUV needed about 55340 votes to get a seat at the parliament, while the MUD 81851 and the PPT 176989.5. Care to explain this?\n\n&gt;Nah, I will. It's called [Gerrymandering](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mky11UJb9AY). It's the reason why [this](http://www.reportero24.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/asamblea-4a.jpg) [happened](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-s30PAzBL7Qo/TWBQ3O2rIFI/AAAAAAAAAqM/UEsxBdeQ6kE/s1600/afp_instalacion_nueva_asamblea_nacional_1.jpg). Basically, you arrange the electoral districts to suit your voting intention. This means, according to population you need more or less votes to earn a seat. It's done in Venezuela, it's done in the USA, it's *heavily* done in Spain.\n\n&gt;Those who didn't vote for the PSUV and went with the MUD + PPT amount a total of 51.13%. Sure, there are more than two candidates; however I don't believe they will earn a significant amount of votes for them in the big picture to greatly variate these results.\n\n&gt;I ask you again: does the current Assembly shows a true, democratic proportion or not?\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/10tns3/in_5_days_there_will_be_elections_in_venezuela_i/c6hvlta"},

{"title":"ELI5- Newton's laws of motion","question_detail":"Explain the 3 laws of motion to my inner baby. ","answer":"1) an object in motion stays in motion. If you kick a ball, with nothing else around (like in space), it will keep moving. Likewise, an object not moving will continue to not move, like the computer. Unless something makes it move. Everything you see stops moving because there is a force acting on it (see two).\n\n2) F= ma. For is equal to mass times acceleration. There is a direct relationship between force and acceleration. Next time you go to the store with your mom, close your eyes while you are in the car. You'll notice you feel the same when you are stilling in at a stop light, as you do when you are moving at a constant speed. The only thing you \"feel\" is the increasing or decreasing of speed. Mass, is what you are made of, everything you see has a mass. Mass tends to oppose motion. Its harder to push your dad than your younger sister on a swing set.\n\n3)Ever force has an equal and opposite force. Forces only exist in pairs. Back to the car, when your mom is slowing down at a stop sign, not only do you \"feel\" the seat belt pushing you, the seat beat \"feels\" you pushing it. When you hit your little sister, it hurts her, but it also hurts your hand. (don't hit)"},
{"title":"ELI5: Why isn't Pluto considered a planet anymore?","answer":"Here's the deal with Pluto\n\n* Way back in the day, we had 6 *planets* that came from the Greeks. They were the 6 objects that moved in the sky but not with the stars, that were not comets. The 6 planets were Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn. These were \"the planets\" for centuries.\n\n* Along come Copernicus. He shows that the earth rotates around the sun and the moon rotates around the earth. Suddenly, we've lost 2 planets (sun and moon) and gained 1 (earth). We never really settle on a definition of planets, but decide kind of haphazardly that they are big things that orbit the sun.\n\n* 1781 Sir William Herschel discovers what he thinks is a comet, but seems to have a regular orbit and no tail. It doesn't even occur to him at first that this could be a planet because all of the planets have been known since antiquity, but over time, he's convinced it is. He decides to call it *George* (after the King) but everyone else thinks that's stupid so they settle on Uranus.\n\n* Uranus' isn't behaving the way the laws of Newton says it should. Astronomers figure out there must be another object past Uranus affecting it's orbit. Astronomers spend a couple of decades crunching the numbers and use the laws of motion to find Neptune.\n\n* Neptune isn't behaving the way the laws of Newton says it should. Astronomers think there's another large object out there affecting Neptune's gravity.\n\n*Meanwhile...*\n\n* Early 1800s astronomers discover Ceres (what we now call a dwarf planet - which is the largest object in the asteroid belt). They decide it's a planet.\n\n* 1840s Astronmers discover Pallas, Juno, and Vesta (all in what's now called the asteroid belt) and decide they are planets. Textbooks of the day list them as planets. Children were taught these in school.\n\n* 1854: Discovery Astrea, Hebe, Iris, Flora, Metis, Hygeia, Parthenope, Victoria, Egeria, Irene and Eunomia in the asteroid belt. And astronomers think: **what if these aren't planets but rather, a new kind of real estate in the solar system?** They realize these objects are all smaller than the other planets, haven't cleared their orbits, and most of them (all but Ceres) aren't round. So they call them asteroids, and members of the asteroid belt.\n\nOkay, back to the missing mass affecting Neptune:\n\n* Science is convinced there must be another planet out their affecting Neptune's orbit. They call this \"Planet X\" but can't seem to find it.\n\n* Since they can't seem to find Planet X with math, the Lowell Observatory begins a systematic search of the sky. In 1930 they discover Pluto (like most celestial discoveries, it's been seen many times before but people just don't realize what they're looking at).\n\n* Time passes and people realize Pluto doesn't have the mass sufficient to be Planet X. More research is done and it turns out some of the original data about Neptune was incorrect and there is no need for a Planet X.\n\nOkay, skip to the modern era:\n\n* 2004, 2005 we discover Haumea, Makemake, and Eris. Like Pluto, all three are round, orbit the sun, and are in the same general area past Nepute. As well, like Pluto (and unlike all the other planets) none of the three have substantially cleared their orbits of all other debris. By the criteria we used to call Pluto a planet, these 3 should be planets. There's also a belief that a lot more of these planets are out there. So rather than call 3 new things planets, astronomers decide that Pluto is more like what Ceres was: not a planet, but the first body discovered in a **new type of real estate in the solar system.**\n\n* Rather than accept all these new bodies as planets, the IAU (a professional organization of astronomers) decides to reclassify them as *dwarf planets*"},

{"title":"why is subsidized farming bad?","question_detail":"why is subsidized farming bad","answer":"the main complaint with farm subsidizes is not itself, but rather what food is being subsidized. The US government spends the majority of farm subsidizes on inedible corn. this corn cannot be eaten, seeing as it is not sweet corn and is turned into chemicals like high-fructose corn syrup (hfcs). obviously hfcs is not healthy and is put in many foods, the reason for it being a more practical for food companies to use hfcs instead of traditional sugar is because it is so inexpensive. ideally, everyone should eat traditional sugar and the food companies would all be more than happy to use it as an alternative, but it is expensive compared to using subsidized corn. if the us government stopped subsidizing inedible corn, ideally, hfcs would no longer exist.

{"title":"ELI5: Why is having so much U.S. national debt bad?\n","question_detail":"I understand debt of all kinds is unfavorable. But I personally haven't seen any effects, outside of our credit rating being downgraded, of having so much debt. Explain what the effects are, or could be, with so much debt. ","answer":"Simply put, going into debt *can* put extra strain on the economy, because debt must be repaid at interest.  But it's not that simple.  \n  \nLet's say you want to spend $1 billion increasing the number of fire stations, building new roads, or whatever else the government wants to spend money on.  You have the option of either paying for it now, or borrowing the money and paying it back later, with interest.  In both cases, you will ultimately have to raise taxes to pay for that spending.  \n  \nThe decision for governments to go into debt is really between taxing now or taxing later, and there are a few things to think about when making that decision.  Off the top of my head:  \n  \n1) What is the expected Net Present Value of the borrowing?  If the interest rate that you will have to pay is lower than the expected inflation rate, then borrowing now will ultimately be less expensive to the taxpayer than simply raising taxes now, because the extra money expected to be in people's pockets in the future will outweigh the extra money that has to be paid to the lender.  \n  \n2) What's the current economic situation?  If people are struggling, then it might not be a good idea to tax them now, even if the long run cost is going to be a bit higher, because that could just make things even worse.  \n  \n3) What's the expected future economic situation?  If people are expected to be worse off in the future, then it might be better to raise the taxes now instead of later, even if it costs you more in the long run, so that people are spared the taxes when times are expected to be harder.  \n  \nAs Amarkov said, it's about striking the right balance.  Government debt is not necessarily a bad thing - it can be, because you might be taxing people more than you have to or taxing them at a time when they really need to keep as much of their money as they can.  But it's actually sometimes *better* for the taxpayer if the government goes into debt."},

{"title":"ELI5: why is voter turnout so low in the US?","question_detail":"I've been wondering lately why voter turnout is so low in the US. Can someone please explain?","answer":"Mostly because of how our political system is set up. Our citizens are relatively highly educated, wealthy, and interested in politics, which would predict higher turnout, but the system itself is mostly to blame. Like:\n\n* Voting isn't compulsory. Some countries require people to vote.\n* Registration is voluntary. Many other countries handle it automatically. In most states here, it's a two-step process, which is a hassle, and the fact that there are usually deadlines to register, some people miss them who want to vote.\n* Since registration isn't universal, we calculate turnout differently. Most turnout numbers you see divide the number of voters by the number of people over the age of 18. However, the Census doesn't distinguish people eligible to vote from those not (non-citizens, felons), so that artificially deflates turnout numbers in the neighborhood of 5%.\n* We have more elections than most countries, for more offices.\n* We divide power more than most countries, both between the state and national level, and across branches of government. It's not always clear who to rally around when things go wrong, and politicians tend to try to spread blame across the system.\n* Most races are done in single member districts. When a race isn't competitive (which is very often), there's not a lot of motivation to go out and vote. If we had multi-member districts and proportional representation like a lot of countries do, your vote would be more likely to \"matter\".\n\nThe country that is most similar to us on a lot of these things is Switzerland, which also has relatively low turnout."},

{"title":"How do microwaves cook food?","answer":"Did you ever have a speaker that had a 'buzz' when it played certain sounds?  The reason that buzz shows up is something loose (let's say a wire) in the speaker is being 'shaken' by 'just the right noise'.  \n\nThe way scientists talk about that 'just the right noise' thing happening is to say the 'frequency' of the sound 'wave' lines up with (matches) the loose wire's 'natural frequency' (the way it shakes when you pull it back and release it).  \n\nSo when the right sound is played it shakes the loose wire because the sound is like a set of regular waves.  Those waves (let's say they're a foot high and hitting every second) hit the wire just right to get it shaking, and so long as that sound keeps playing that wire keeps shaking.  If the waves do not hit exactly every second the wire wouldn't shake.  We'd say that their 'frequency' wouldn't match.\n\nSo we move onto the microwave.  Inside is a little 'wave maker' that is able to make special 'energy waves' that are just the right size.  \"Just the right size for what?\" you may ask.  Well think of your food that you're putting in the microwave.  The food is made of all kinds of stuff, but one thing that's almost sure to be in there (all over the place) is water.  Now, if you take some water and you split it into smaller and smaller containers, you'll eventually have the smallest container possible which contains the tiniest spec of water possible.  If you go any smaller you'll not have water anymore, you'll have some other stuff (that makes up water but isn't water).  That smallest spec of water (scientists call a molecule) is H2O and it has a special shape.\n\nRemember that speaker wire?  Well, the microwave's special 'energy waves' are tuned to shake the shape of water when you have a single 'molecule' like the speaker shakes that speaker wire.  Those 'energy waves' are hitting a bunch of the water 'molecules' and jiggling them all over the place.  Interestingly they are hitting in specific spots (along the 'special wavelength'), which is one of the reasons why you can get hot and cold spots in your food when it comes out of the microwave.\n\n\"So what, it shakes water...\" You might say.  Well, the thing about shaking molecules is that is how you 'heat things up'.  So when you apply fire to paper you are really 'shaking up the molecules'.  Fun weird stuff happens when look closely at fire, but that's another story...\n\nhttp://youtu.be/ITpDrdtGAmo"},

{"title":"ELI5:The Coriolis Effect","answer":"The Earth is constantly rotating. The Earth obviously has a higher diameter in the equator, so land moves very fast there. On the other hand, if I'm very close to the South Pole, then land is moving much slower. If I were to be standing at 60 degrees north latitude, then the land where I'm standing would be spinning at half the speed of the equator.\n\nConsidering that at 60 degrees latitude the diameter of the Earth is far smaller than the diameter at the equator, wouldn't moving one metre at 60 degrees latitude give me more longitude then moving one metre at the equator? Draw an one inch line on a globe at the equator and a one inch line over Australia. How far around the globe does each line go? This shows us that different latitudes have different linear speeds.\n\nSo we know that the Earth is constantly rotating eastward, and that different latitudes have different linear speeds. If I were to start from Antarctica and start walking to the equator my eastward speed would be gradually increasing, because I am changing my latitude, and each latitude has a different eastward speed.\n\nHowever, something that isn't directly connected to Earth (eg. a bullet, artillery fire) would retain the same amount of eastward speed as it moves, even as the Earth's linear speed increases. If the bullet moves far enough then the ground will be moving faster in the eastward direction then the bullet is. This will give the appearance that the bullet is moving to the west.\n\nHere's another example. I have a very long range bullet, that I fire from the Magnetic South Pole. The eastward velocity is 0. When I fire my bullet, the eastward velocity is 0 and it will remain 0 no matter where it goes, because it isn't directly connected to the ground. This bullet then reaches all the way to the equator where it is still travelling 0 in the eastward direction, where the ground is moving 1000 miles per hour to the east. The relative velocity of the bullet in the east-west axis in comparison to the ground is 1000 miles per hour to the west.\n\n(Not as easy to explain as I thought it would be.

{"title":"ELI5: How does ObamaCare impact hospitals?","question_detail":"I read over a lot of the ObamaCare posts here, but I want to specify a question regarding hospitals and ObamaCare.\n\nFrom what I've been told, part of ObamaCare impacts how much money a hospital receives based on the quality of care given to a patient. I believe it used to be a 100% before ObamaCare, but now a hospital is no longer guaranteed to get that 100% which only means a lower income for the hospital. I think the organization this money comes from is insurance or the government, I can't remember which. I believe it's something to do with hospitals getting \"reimbursed\" but now no longer gets that full reimbursement often.\n\nIs this right? If so, doesn't this mean the overall hospital can no longer pay their employees as much and thus could start lacking enough staff to provide for patients? And not only that, lower salaries will likely not attract as highly skilled people to work there. This sounds like a loss in patient care.\n\nCan anyone help me clarify what I'm understanding and what I may be misunderstanding? Thanks.

What I'm not understanding is why physics needs the equation, and what the equation is meant to quantify about the relationship between the two forces.  ","answer":"In the world of theoretical physics we've come up with two exceptionally well tested models. One of these, which we use to describe electromagnetic interactions and certain other subatomic particle interactions (called the strong and weak interactions) is called the standard model of particle physics. It's a very, very well tested model, but it ignores gravitational interactions. This is reasonable, because the things you're working with when you need it tend to have very, very small masses, so the effect of gravity can be largely ignored. Because the things we're dealing with are particle sized, this is a *quantum* theory.\n\nThe other, which is our current model of gravity, is the general theory of relativity. This model is *classical*, in the sense that it ignores any quantum effects. This is reasonable, because the things you're working with when you need it tend to be quite large and quantum effects simply don't manifest on those scales.\n\nSo we have these two models, they've both been tested quite thoroughly and been found to accurately describe events in our universe, and they each basically ignore the other one. One of them tells us what very, very small things do, and the other tells us how gravity works. Here's the kicker: what do we do if we happen to find something really, really massive that's also really, really small (say, the region near the center of a black hole)? On the one hand we'd like to use the general theory of relativity, because gravity is going to matter, but on the other we'd like to use a quantum model because small things behave quantum mechanically. And that puts us in a pickle, because when you try to just put the results of one model into the other, you get nonsense back; the two models are simply incompatible.\n\nThere are some approximation techniques you can use, but they're just that: approximate. It would be really nice if we had *one* model that could be used for quantum effects *and* gravitational effects. If we did, we could (at our discretion) ignore gravity and it should look just like the standard model. Similarly, we could choose to ignore quantum effects and it should look just like the general theory of relativity. But if we wanted, or needed, both effects, we'd be able to use the full model to figure out what to expect and explain what's observed. In principle, this would give us insight into what was happening near the very beginning of our universe (at which time both quantum effects and gravitational effects are important) as well as into the behavior of exotic objects like black holes. This information could, in turn, lead to a better understanding of how our universe will change over time. The discovery of such a model might *also* lead to a prediction of new physics, and thence to new possible technologies, in the sense that things we hadn't considered as possible before might *be* possible under certain circumstances, and we just don't see that because it requires both gravity and the other interactions."},

(Not death, but as in an antidote, haha)\n\n\nThanks!","answer":"okay, so in your body there are thousands of different chemical reactions that need to continue to happen in order for you to continue to live.\n\nPoisons interfere with those reactions in some way.  They can either stop them or slow them down or speed them up way too fast.  Because all of the reactions are interrelated, screwing up one part of it will end up causing the entire thing to shut down, kind a spark of static randomly touches part of a computer motherboard.\n\nAs for why there are so many, that's because of how many different reactions there are that are important to life and how delicate some of those reactions are.\n\nAs for why some of them don't have antidotes;\nIn order for something to be an antidote, it has to have 2 qualities.  It will interfere with/stop the poison faster than the poison kills you, and it needs to be safer for you than the poison.  There are a couple of different strategies for how antidotes actually work.  \n\nOne of them is to replace the chemical that the poison destroys, which is why, if your kid ever accidentally eats rat poison, the doctor will give the kid a shot of vitamin K.  The shot will replace the vitamin K that the rat poison destroys.\n\nAnother is to bind to or react with the poison and turn it into a less dangerous form, which you then usually pass from your body (or store permanently).  I think this one is probably more common, and would include things like snake anti-venom and the treatments for most accidental ingestions."},

We would then just need to have an algorithm to convert it back and forth to binary when the computer needs it. I mean, we could store more data in the same space if the media can have something like 10 different states instead of only two.","answer":"Because it takes a lot more effort to be that precise.\n\nIn order to be fast, computers like to be a little sloppy.  If 0 volts is supposed to be 0, and 5 volts supposed to be 1, it is nice for the computer to be able to chuck out a 3v value, drop to 1v, back up to 6v, then down to 2v, and have that read as 1010.

And I suppose I also want to know why it needs to be proved. Surely 2 is defined as 1+1.","answer":"Well, *Principia* is based on a kind of set theory, so at its basis there's a bunch of details that have to do with that.  origin415 talks about the set-theoretic definition of natural numbers.\n\nBut that's probably not the thing that will help you the most; rather, you might want to understand [Peano's axioms for arithmetic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms), which are the standard axioms that we use to prove things like \"1 + 1 = 2\".  Here is a very simplified, informal presentation of some of Peano's axioms:\n\n1. 0 is a natural number.\n2. If n is a natural number, then S(n), called the **successor** of *n*, is also a natural number.\n3. 0 is not the successor of any natural number.\n4. Nothing qualifies as a natural number except as under rules 1-3.\n5. 0 = 0\n6. If S(a) = S(b), then a = b\n7. n + 0 = n\n8. n + S(m) = S(n) + m\n\nSo the theorem that you're interested in, 1 + 1 = 2, is expressed like this in Peano arithmetic (and I'm leaving out the parentheses in the S(0) and S(S(0))):\n\n* S0 + S0 = SS0\n\nProof steps:\n\n1. S0 + S0 = S0 + S0 (reflexivity of equality)\n2. S0 + S0 = SS0 + 0 (rule 8)\n3. S0 + S0 = SS0 (rule 7)\n\nWhat's the point of this?  Well, it's not just that 1 + 1 = 2; it's that **the sum of any two natural numbers, no matter how large, can be calculated using only the concept of a *successor* and rules 7 and 8**.  And a similar thing can be said about multiplication, with the axioms n x 0 = 0 and n x S(m) = n + (n x m).\n\nCompare this to how addition and multiplication are normally taught in grade school.  They make kids memorize the result of all of the one-digit additions (1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, ... 9 + 9 = 18), the multiplication tables, and algorithms that allow you to calculate large sums and multiplications using the smaller ones you've memorized.\n\nIn comparison, Peano arithmetic is much simpler; it just has zero, successor and a handful of rules.  But it's also much more cumbersome for actual human calculation, because proving 45 x 37 = 1,665 is going to take more than 1,665 steps.  However, the primitivity is of interest in advanced mathematics and logic, because there we're not interested in adding and multiplying a few numbers; what we're interested in is proving general theorems about **all** additions, multiplications and combinations of them.  A simpler, primitive axiomatic theory of arithmetic makes it much easier to prove **metatheorems** about arithmeticâtheorems about what can be proved in arithmetic and what can't.\n\nThe most famous metatheorems about arithmetic are [GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorem), which prove that there are some formulas in arithmetic that can neither be proved or disproved."},

Instead of putting a little bit of money in at a time and letting the money grow with interest to fund future payments, the USPS has to pay in every dollar they will pay out, even if that payment won't occur for many years.  Most companies (and government organizations) put in only the amount of money that they expect will be necessary to *earn* the amount of money they expect to pay out.

{"title":"ELI5: Object Oriented Design Patterns.","question_detail":"Hi,\n\nWhat are design patterns such as the singleton and the factory.  How do they work, what do they do, and why are they important in programming? ","answer":"One of the fundamental notions of good programming, and Ojected Oriented Programming (OOP) in particular, is to not reinvent the wheel, making slight different wheels each time.\n\nDesign patterns provide models that accomplish common programming task.  It gives the author a leg up, because he isn't reinventing the wheel, and anyone else how has to work on the code can say \"Oooo, that's a factory, I know what he is trying to do now\".\n\nIt is similar to choosing a car.  You don't ponder how many wheels it should have, and whether it should run on kerosene or alcohol.  You look at the various tried and true models, design whether an economy car or a truck or a sports car suits your needs, and once you make that decision, then you start worrying about the details.\n\n\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: Futuristic Bipedal Mech robots. Are they better than the caterpillar tracks Tanks have?","question_detail":".","answer":"I have often wondered this myself, in fact.\n\nI just completed Metal Gear Solid a month or so ago, and the Metal Gear is supposedly the ultimate tank... so why the fuck does it have legs???  To me, legs seem inferior to wheels/ treads in almost every way including being unsalvageably vulnerable AT EVERY JOINT!  Hip, knee, ankle: take out any of these structures on either leg and the mech is done.\n\nA giant tank truck with 32 wheels can certainly afford to lose a couple, or even an axle.  And while destroying a tank tread would render the tank useless, it seems as if the degree to which we can armor treads would make them fundamentally more stable than a pair of legs, serious damage to either (or *any* in the case of an ATAT, for instance) of which causes the mech to fall over.  That can't be a fun position from which to fight.  At least a detreaded tank's cannon is still pointing the right way.\n\nFurthermore, I don't see how legs would or could be fundamentally faster than wheels or treads either.\n\nThe only real advantage conferred by legs might be something like fighting on unstable terrain, like a rock field, but the chances of catching a leg on something and twisting or torquing it (and again, falling) seems to outweigh any slightly improved ability to navigate said field.\n\nPlus, the moment slope becomes an issue at all, legs become a huge detriment once again.  Compare a low, flat 4WD vehicle driving up or down a steep incline to a human mountaineer who often has to go down on all fours to negotiate the slope.  No contest.\n\nI really think that the only reason we see mecha so frequently in anime, videogames, and science fiction media is because the resemblance of a mech to a human being feels impressive and futuristic in the same sense that humanoid cyborgs (like the Terminator) do.  We tend to have an innate tendency to want to re-envision the world in our image and often do so, perhaps lazily.  If we really want to build a futuristic robot based on an animal design i suspect that something closer to a snake or a spider would be far more advantageous than a humanoid mech, but, do we really need to restrict ourselves to the animal kingdom for our battlebots anyway?  I'm sure that if we work together and think outside the box on this one, we, as a species, can bring about a future filled with far more effective and terrifying death machines than bipedal mecha."},

To this day, animal shelters dare not let people adopt black cats around Halloween for fear that they will be abused).  Consequently, people who owned dogs tended to *train* them to hate cats.  Remember Michael Vick?  Assholes like him used to be a lot more common; and cats were among the training fodder for dogs being trained to fight for entertainment."},
{"title":"Please explain Alcohol dehydrogenase deficiency","answer":"Like everything else you put into your body, alcohol has to be digested. Alcohol dehydrogenase is the enzyme in your body that digests alcohol. However it can only digest so much at a time; when you drink to much alcohol to digest it all at once, the leftover undigested alcohol will get into your system and you will get drunk. If you then stop drinking, the alcohol dehydrogenase will break down the alcohol and you'll sober up!\n\nAlcohol dehydrogenase deficiency means that you don't have as much of the enzyme as other people do and will break down alcohol more slowly than they will. This means that you will get drunk faster and stay drunk longer than you would if you had more of the enzyme. Side effects like a red, flushed face are also common. Alcohol dehydrogenase deficiency will run in families and is very common in certain regions of the world, most notably Asia. "},

{"title":"Why does semen take a 'divert' from the testes up, and around the kidneys during ejaculation?","question_detail":"I remember watching a documentary which explained an evolutionary reasons for the tunnel that carries semen out from the testes, taking a divert up into the abdomen of the male, looping around some artery/vessel, and then travelling back down to the penis. An image was recently on the Reddit homepage (NSFW: http://i.imgur.com/7K08B.png ), which illustrated the path that is taken.\n\nI was trying to explain it eloquently to my partner, but it was essentially idiotic, with no understanding or proper reference. However, it's likely that I'm getting 'kidneys' confused with something else (having never really seen my own insides, and my total lack of what is actually happening in the given image) - but there's definitely some sort of unnecessary re-route","answer":"The prostate gland (sitting just below the bladder) acts as a \"switch\", sending either urine or semen down the penis, but not both at the same time.  So that's kind of important.\n\nIt's also important that the testes are sitting outside the main body cavity.  Your body can help keep the testicles at the proper temperature by pulling them into the body when it's cold (shrinkage, Mr Costanza), or letting them drop lower when it's hot.  So you need extra plumbing to route the sperm that way."},

{"title":"ELI5 Can someone explain the concept of shadow banking?","answer":"The main function of a bank is that they take your deposit, and they pay you interest.  In order to pay you interest, they have to invest your bank account - but they have to be *super* careful not to lose your bank account.  That's hard to do - incredibly hard.  Most investments, even good investments, lose money from time to time.  A bank has to find investments that never, ever lose money.  That's very challenging.  Interestingly, *mortgages* are an investment that rarely if ever lose money.\n\nBack in the day, banks used to occasionally screw this up, and they'd lose people's bank accounts.  This tended to happen particularly during financial crises.  To make matters worse, banks tended to lose everyone's bank account at the same time, which would wreak havoc on the economy.\n\nSo back in the 1930's, the government created the FDIC - a government agency whose job is basically to make sure that banks never lose their customer's bank accounts.  The FDIC does this by requiring banks to follow certain safety rules, and they on top of that, they insure the banks just in case.\n\nThe \"shadow banking\" system consists of financial firms that accept deposits, and they pay interest on those deposits, and they promise to never lose those deposits.  All just like a bank.  But they use various loopholes to make sure they don't have to follow the regulations that banks have to follow.  Particularly, they can't *call* themselves banks.  And, they don't have FDIC insurance.  The freedom from regulations means they can take risks with the deposits that normal banks can't take.  They can also do things that normal banks can't do, like accept billion-dollar deposits.\n\nThe problem with the shadow banking system is that it is vulnerable to the same problems that the regular banking system used to be vulnerable to: during financial collapses, it can lose everyone's money.

","answer":"First thing to note is that we human beings have *awful* smell-receptors in our noses. A dog can follow the smell of someone who ran through a field *days* before, but we normally need a room to be filled with 'smell' before we can pick up on it.\n\nNow what do our smell-receptors actually look for? Certain combinations of chemicals in the air. That's billions of 'specks' of whatever it is floating around and into our noses (that smell of someone leaving a bathroom just got a lot more gross).\n\nMost of the time these specks just whizz straight through our nose and into our lungs without hitting the receptors. However, when the air is humid and filled with little droplets of water, they collect all the specs like little globs of glue.

A part of the brain called the hypothalamus acts like a thermostat for the body -- it tells the body what temperature to maintain. When you have a fever, the set point for the temperature is raised in the hypothalamus, just like turning up a thermostat. Then the hypothalamus tells the rest of the body, \"You're too cold! You need to be warmer!\" The body responds just like it would if it were thrown out into the snow on a winter's day -- it shivers, contracting and releasing muscles to build up heat. This raises your body temperature and gives you the fever. But to you, the person living inside your body, it feels like you've gotten suddenly cold."},

{"title":"ELI5: Banks vs. Credit Unions","question_detail":"What's the difference?  Why should I switch?  What are the advantages/disadvantages of each?","answer":"Banks are for-profit companies: they're only one true goal is to make money for their owners, i.e. shareholders. This *tends to*, but not always, translate into doing things that the average consumer is disadvantaged by, such as charging high amounts for overdraft fees (or rearranging charges to your account to maximize the number of them), higher interest rates, etc.\n\nCredit Unions are different in that EVERY member is a part-owner, and they're non-profit. Therefore, they exist solely for their customers, not their shareholders (since the customers ARE shareholders). This *tends to*, but does not always, mean lower interest rates, a more personal atmosphere, easier to get loans, etc.\n\nBanks, since they're for profit, tend to be much larger (which also introduces the 'hatred' of big corp.), but due to their large size have the ability to offer more services (more loan types, investment vehicles, virtual accounts, etc), and tend to have more ATM locations, so they can be more convenient. \n\nSince credit unions are smaller, they usually don't have as wide of a network of ATMs or offer as many services. Also, in most cases you have to meet some sort of condition to become a member, such as being an employee of a certain company/school/union, have residency in a certain area, etc. \n\n\nIn my opinion, if you have the option to join a credit union, do it. You'll be much better off (again, my opinion, but this opinion is pretty widely shared). \n\nHowever, if you travel a lot, or need access to a lot of ATM's, a bank might be better for you. \n\nIt comes down to what fits your situation better"},

How come their currency is more valuable?","answer":"It doesn't really matter if one number is bigger than the other number. What matters is how many Euros you get and how much stuff you can buy with a Euro. So if I have 3 Euros, but it costs me 3 Euros to buy some candy, then I have no more Euros left! But if I have $2 and it only costs $1 to buy some candy then I have a dollar left over! So even though the Euro is a bigger number, what really matters is how much stuff you can buy with that amount.\n\nSo we now know two things: How much can I buy with a euro vs how much can I buy with a USD. And we know how many dollars it costs to buy a euro.\n\nSo if I can buy a piece of candy for 3 euros or $1, and I can $2 for one Euro, then I'm much better off selling my Euros to buy dollars because that way I'll be able to get a LOT more candy.\n\nVery smart people who run banks and businesses are aware of this, and so they trade euros for dollars all the time to the extent that the amount of stuff you can buy with euros vs the amount of stuff you can buy with dollars is in proportion to how many euros you can buy per dollar. \n\nIn the perfect world, this means that you can't just trade dollars for euros and therefore buy more stuff. But sometimes people have other reasons for buying dollars instead of euros or vice versa (e.g. if they think that one country is going to be unable to do any work then that makes the banks nervous and so they don't want that countries money).\n\nIf people have a strong reason to prefer one currency over the other that is not related to how much candy that currency can buy, then that currency is considered to be overvalued.\n\nIf a currency is significantly overvalued, it means that people are knowingly giving themselves a bad deal because they are nervous about the future of the undervalued currency.\n\nNot quite ELI5 link here: http://ideas.repec.org/a/wfo/monber/y2000i8p487-500.html"},

{"title":"Why do we \"warm up\" the car every morning? ","answer":"With fuel injected cars it doesn't really matter that much anymore.  The reason why it started is because you're engine reaches a certain operating temperature where it is going to run most efficiently.  Older cars have chokes on them to make the fuel to air mixture more rich, this makes the combustion easier because you don't have the heat of the engine to keep the cylinders warm enough to have the explosion needed to keep running. As the engine block warms, you can make that mixture thinner because its easier for cylinder to reach combustion it needs, so no backfires or stalling.  Cars now have computers to control this, so you can get in the car and go, it's better to let it warm up for a little but once you get going it will level out at operating temp pretty quick.

{"title":"ELI5 how different regions in America develop their accents?","question_detail":"I mean if you go to the south, they have an accent, so do the people on jersy shore. How did those places develop their accents?","answer":"Well it's not limited to English speaking people, accents develop in every language. Much of it has to do with languages themselves, influences by languages on different groups of people alter local accents. Because of the way a language pronounces a certain word, that pronunciation over time alters the speaking of those it influences. Over time all these changes of language and ways of saying things collect together in groups, as people together in social groups, so the accents gather with like accents. \n\nIt's rather like groups of people that collect together over various interests. These people who gather together spread their accents to each other and their children after them. Children readily pick up their parents accents rather quickly in their development.\n\nIt not only happens socially, but also geographically. As mentioned earlier how languages influence accents, the more of one group of people with a language move into an area together the more their language and way of speaking will influence that area. In the US there is a varied mix of nationalities that for the most part early on settled in areas together that resembled or reminded them of their home country. So them being together in that or that locale had a large role in shaping that locations accent.\n\nThere is also an interesting thing called the \"paradox of the periphery\", which when dealing with language and accents is about how an isolated group can retain an older accents of the original group they sprang from, which has over time changed. The best example of this is the Amish and Mennonite groups. Their accent has retained the older accents, (because of their isolation) wordings and phrasings of their ancestors. Where as their ancestors from Europe have  changed to completely new and different accents."},

On Yap Island they used [giant stone disks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yap) as their currency, in most of the world rare metal has been used, and today we use a combination of credit, fiat currency (paper notes), and electronic transaction. All forms of money depend greatly on people's belief that the money that they hold can be exchanged for future goods and labor. All money is a debt unpaid until someone exchanges their money for something else. Using paper, gold, or even big rocks with holes in the middle doesn't change the function of Money, only the medium used to \"store\" the value of it.

They all have 94 protons but some have more or less neutrons.  Some plutonium with 145 neutrons is out there, that's what we often use in nuclear reactors.\n\nThe protons stick together normally because of what's called the \"strong nuclear force\".  But with plutonium if you hit it hard enough with a neutron you can split it in half, and overcome the strong nuclear force.  This splitting actually \"destroys\" some of the neutrons, turning them into pure energy.  This is a massive amount of energy though and it sends other neutrons in every direction.  If these hit other atoms they'll possibly split too.\n\nLet me know if you need more explanations."},

{"title":"Eli5: What actually happens when you get the wind knocked out of you?","answer":"There is always some air left in your lungs even if you breathe out really hard. It is called the FRC (functional reserved capacity). It keeps the tiny balloons (called alveoli) in your lungs inflated. When 'the wind is knocked out of you', say with a fall, that reserved capacity is pushed out of your lungs. The tiny balloons collapse making it hard for your lungs to get oxygen into your blood and CO2 out of your blood. That is why you gasp for air, you have to fill up the balloons. \nAs a side note, it is not a lack of oxygen that makes you want to breathe when you hold your breath, it is because there is a build up of CO2 in your cerebral spinal fluid.

{"title":"Explain to me like I'm five Chiral Molecules (text included)","question_detail":"From the Gale encyclopedia of Science (Long & Lots of big words)\n\nA molecule is said to be chiral if it lacks symmetry and its mirror images are not superimposable. To be chiral a molecule must lack symmetry, that is, a chiral molecule can not have any type of symmetry.\n\nCarbon atoms with four sp3 hybridized orbitals can enter into up to four different bonds about the central carbon atom. When the central carbon bonds with differing atoms or groups of atoms the carbon is termed an asymmetric carbon atom. Bromochlorofluoromethane is an example of such a molecule. The central carbon, with four sp3 bonds oriented (pointing) to the corners of a tetrahedron, is bonded to bromine, chlorine, fluorine, and methane atoms. There is no symmetry to this molecule.\n\nChiral carbon atoms are also assigned an R and S designation. Although the rules for determining this designation can be complex, for simple molecules and compounds with chiral carbons the determination is easily accomplished with the help of a model of the molecule. The four different bonded groups are assigned a priority. When assigning priority to groups, atoms that are directly bonded to the central chiral carbon atom have their priority based upon their atomic number. The atom with the highest atomic number has highest priority and the atom with the lowest atomic number the lowest priority. As a result, hydrogen atoms bonded to the chiral molecule have the lowest priority. If isotopes are bonded then the isotope with the largest mass has the higher priority. The molecule is then turned so that the lowest priority group is farthest away from view. If one must take a counterclockwise path from the highest to lowest priority group the chiral configuration is said to be sinister (S). If the path from highest to lowest priority groups is clockwise then the chiral molecule is said to be rectus (R).\n\nThe compound carvone has two three-dimensional structures, one S and the other R (see Figure 4).\n\nThe compounds differ in their three-dimensional structure by the position of the indicated hydrogen atom. In S-Carvone, only the hydrogen atom is pointed into the paper, while in the R compound, the hydrogen atom is coming out of the paper. S-Carvone has a caraway flavor when tasted, whereas the R compound has the flavor of spearmint.\n\nThe rectus (R) and sinister (S) property relates to the structure of an individual molecule. In contrast, dextro (+) and levo (-) properties are based on the properties of a large collection of the molecules or complex.\n\nBecause a molecule can have more than one chiral carbon, the number of stereoisomers can be determined by the 2n rule, where n equals the number of chiral carbons. Thus, if one chiral carbon is present there are two possible stereoisomers, with two chiral carbons there are four possible stereoisomers. Any chemical reaction that yields predominantly one stereoisomer out of several stereoisomer possibilities is said to be a stereoselective reaction.\n\n\nI need this for chemistry!","answer":"Look at your hands. Put them flat on a table and then put one on top of the other. There is no way that you can rotate your hands so that they are the same. The thumbs will never overlap the same unless you flip one hand or the other over. That's a different sort of rotation from what I'm describing.\n\nThis is why some molecules are called right-handed and others left-handed."},

{"title":"ELI5: 4g wireless","question_detail":"Hi guys, I'm 5.\n\nWhat is 4g wireless?  Despite being able to use it everywhere with my phone, why can't my laptop find the signal in available networks?  Also, what are those cards people put in their computers to allow them to access 4g?","answer":"4G Wireless is the current wireless generation for cellular connectivity. 4G, also known as HSPA+, provides faster data speeds than 3G.\n\nYour laptop cannot find 4G signals because your laptop's wireless card only supports 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi. 4G wireless operates on 900MHz and does not match the frequencies in your wireless card.\n\nTo put it in easier terms, why can't the lightning connector for an iPhone 5 fit into the iPhone 4 port? The lightning port is built to works with lightning dock ports only. Kind of like the 4G wireless frequency. 900MHz won't communicate with a wireless card that is built and tuned for 2.4GHz and 5GHz radios. They are different frequencies."},

{"title":"ELI5: The Watergate Scandal ","question_detail":"What exactly happened?","answer":"People involved with the Nixon re-election campaign embarked on various \"dirty tricks\" to get information about or discredit people they didn't like, some of them involving crimes, some just creepy. In the process of one of these, a group of people (\"the plumbers\") were caught breaking into the Watergate building in Washington DC. It was then discovered that they were hired by people in or associated with the Nixon administration and his re-election committee.  \n\nThere were Congressional hearings, and some key people (including Nixon's former lawyer) testified. There was also a key guy called \"Deep Throat\" who fed confidential information to reporters from the Washington Post. Congress ended up subpoenaing a lot of information from the White House, and if I recall correctly the Supreme Court had to rule on some of that.  \n\nAs in a lot of situations like this, the original crimes became overshadowed by the attempts to cover up the administration's involvement by doing things like lying to Congress (a crime). Some top people from Nixon's White House staff and re-election committee were found guilty and went to jail, including the Attorney General (the nation's top law enforcement officer, sorta). When it got to the point where it was likely that President Nixon was going to be shown to be involved in the cover-up and he would likely be impeached by Congress, he resigned.  \n\nOne of the most amusing parts of the whole fiasco was the infamous 18 1/2 minute gap. It came out during the investigation that Nixon audiotaped a lot of the conversations in the Oval Office. One of those tapes was found to have a very suspicious gap, and the administration explained that Nixon's secretary did it by accident. But it was later shown that to do what she said she had done, she would have had to have reached far to her left and at the same time activate a foot pedal far to the right.  \n   \nThe second most amusing part?  The group working for Nixon's re-election was known as The Committee to RE-Elect the President. CREEP. "},
{"title":"How can Wifi data stream rates increase when the frequency band still stays the same (for example, wireless b vs wireless n, both which are 2.4 gHz frequencies yet have dramatically different speeds)?","answer":"2.4ghz is what is known as a carrier frequency.  It doesn't directly related to the speed of transmission (until you got to really REALLY superfast transmission speeds), the speed increases are due to the technology that sends data out on the 2.4ghz range.  Do you know how morse code is sent?  A tone is turned on and off at certain time lengths to mean different things.  That tone might be 440hz, 1000hz, or basically any audible frequency.  That doesn't affect how fast you can transmit data in most cases, because you are turning it on and off much slower than the frequency.  The main roadblock to faster speeds is how quickly you can turn on and off your morse code tone."},

What would I have them set to to RUN better?","answer":"MSAA smooths out the edges of objects that do not align perfectly horizontal/vertically. Think of drawing a slope with only straight lines. It would look like a set of stairs. MSAA smooths out these \"stairs\", and is pretty taxing on your GPU.\n\nFXAA is like MSAA, but fast and inaccurate. The benefit of FXAA is that it doesn't hurt your framerate virtually at all, and still provides some smoothing. Some people don't like this because it tends to over-smooth objects, or blur them.\n\nAnisoptric Filtering renders distant objects that are at extreme angles more clearly. The best example is looking at a fence or a flat road on a low AF setting, then on high. On a low AF setting, you can see where the road starts to blur and look lower quality. AF fixes this.\n\nSSAO applies lighting to individual objects instead of just casting the shadow from them. This gives objects depth, but can be very demanding on a GPU compared to something like HBAO, which is a cheaper version. SSAO basically gives the illusion of depth, where tesselation gives an object actual depth.\n\nTesselation adds depth to objects, and is extremely taxing on a GPU. Consider a brick wall or cobblestone road. Both can be given the appearance of depth through bump-mapping or clever SSAO, but if you get close enough you see the flatness. Tesselation literally bumps out those bricks from the wall and gives it depth. It's probably my favorite graphics effect.\n\nFor your game to run better, use HBAO over SSAO, avoid tesselation and MSAA, and keep FXAA and AF on max."},

So if you bought one of each ticket, you'd win the jackpot along with every possible smaller prize, and your $175M contribution would make the jackpot that much bigger anyway.  What am i missing?","answer":"One reason that I don't see anyone mentioning yet is the time it would take to (1) acquire 175,000,000 tickets, and (2) the time it would take to verify the numbers. I remember someone else doing the math before, and it comes out to a term of years. \n\nSome quick math... Even if you were able to buy a ticket within 30 seconds and verify a ticket in 30 seconds (making each ticket cost 1 minute of time --- assuming you don't do anything (including sleeping) but check tickets, it would take you 330 years to check every ticket. To get that down to 1 year, you'd have to hire 329 people to slave away with you. To allow people to work on this like a real job (8 hours per day, so they can sleep/eat/live), then you need about 1,550 people checking tickets without waste for a year. \n\nBut oh no! Some lottos have a 6 month window to claim the prize... Meaning you'd need to double your workers to 3,100.\n\nSo now you have 3,100 employees searching for a winning lotto card that may not exist...

{"title":"ELI5: how does the US voting system works","question_detail":"I am not American and wondering how the system works? I mean what's the purpose of the popular vote if the election depends on the electoral vote? And why is that all electoral vote for each state was either to Obama or Romney?","answer":"There's no actual nationwide popular vote. When people talk about the popular vote, what's going on is that they're looking at the results from the election of each state and adding them all up so they can talk about how the country at large feels about the candidate.\n\nWhat actually determines the election is the electoral college.\n\nThe way the electoral college works is that every state gets votes based on the number of seats they have in Congress. You get one seat for each senator you have and each representative in the house. There's 100 senators (2 for each state) and 435 members of the House of Representatives (where seats are given out based on population but everyone is guaranteed at least one). In addition we give Washington DC three votes because we don't want to leave them out either.\n\nThis brings the total number of electoral votes to 538. Like I said before, each state is guaranteed at least three votes because every state has two senators and at least one person in the house. This means that small states only get three votes but large states may have a lot of votes. California, for example has 55.\n\nLike I said before, the states aren't actually required to let the people vote on who they want to be president, but they all do anyway. The way this works is that on the Tuesday following the first Monday in November (weird way of specifying, I know) the states hold elections. When you go to vote you get a ballot that will have a list of candidates on it. You select your candidate and turn in your ballot. Your state then collects all the ballots, counts up all the votes, and then chooses people to represent the state in the electoral college based on who won the popular vote in that state. The people who represent their state are called electors.\n\nElectors are actually chosen by the party in the state that sends them. So let's say Barack Obama wins your state. What then happens is that your state government will go to the Democratic Party in your state and ask who they want the electors to be. The party will then give them a list of people who the state will then be the state's voters at the electoral college. These electors cannot currently hold any sort of federal office and cannot have previously sworn an oath of office to uphold the Constitution and then rebelled. (the second part is mostly the result of the Civil War)\n\nMost states use what's called a winner-take-all system where whoever wins the popular vote gets all of the electoral votes for the state. The two exceptions to this are Nebraska and Maine, they assign electors in proportion to how many votes each candidate got. The reason most states choose to allocate their electors with a winner-take-all system is because the electoral college slightly more weight to rural states. If rural states were to divide their votes proportionally it would effectively mitigate that extra weight.\n\nIn many states electors are free to vote for whomever they want, however some states have laws that require electors to vote for the person they're supposed to. That being said, getting appointed to be an elector is a pretty prestigious position and voting differently than the way you're supposed to vote is a good way of making sure your party will never back you for anything ever again.\n\nThe electors will then get together in their state's capitol on the Monday after the second Wednesday in December and meet and cast their votes for president and vice president. Those votes are then sent on to Washington where the newly elected Congress will meet in a special session on January 6th to count the votes and declare a winner.\n\nIn the event that no candidate receives a majority, (270 votes) Congress must go into a special session where the House elects the President and the Senate elects the Vice President. In this scenario, in the House each state only gets one vote, Senators are allowed to vote normally. They keep voting until one candidate gets a majority.\n\nIn the event that no presidential candidate gets a majority by the time of the inauguration (noon on January 20th), the Vice President Elect (the guy who's been voted in as VP but hasn't been sworn in yet) is the acting President until the House can agree on someone. If neither a President or Vice-President is agreed on, the Speaker of the House is acting President."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why don't TV remotes use the same technology as wireless game controllers?","question_detail":"TVs have gotten really advanced yet we still use the same remote technology as we always have. The buttons suck and the range sucks and there's always lag which makes using on screen keyboards a bother. Overall TV remotes suck. A wireless 360 controller doesn't cost much. You're already paying hundreds for the TV, why don't they package it with better remotes and bump the price up a bit? Ones that don't rely on infrared or rubber buttons. Plus it'd be good marketing.\n\nSo, reddit, why hasn't any TV manufacturers done that yet?","answer":"Traditional TV remotes use an beam of infrared light (with an emitter on the remote) to send signals to a TV (with a receiver on the front of the TV).  \n\nMost wireless input devices for computers/game consoles use RF (radio frequency) transmitters, not unlike WiFi or your cell phone, to send data.  \n\nRF is generally 'better' at sending data than IR because RF signals can penetrate objects easily and continue going, whereas IR signals are directional (because light can be easily blocked - even by a sheet of paper).  \n\nThere are two main reasons why RF is not used for TV remotes:  \n\n1.  Expense.  Building and testing an RF antenna is much more expensive than building an infrared transmitter.  The regulatory costs alone (any device that broadcasts on radio frequencies must be certified by the FCC; the same is not true for all lights) are likely higher than the cost of an infrared device.  TV remotes are generally value-adds, meaning that manufacturers are willing to cut corners to make them cheaper - in addition, like the IR technology itself watching TV requires a 'directional' view (you have to look at the TV to watch it) meaning that it isn't totally unlikely that consumers will be able to point the remote at the device.  \n2.  Battery Life.  RF transmission requires much more electric power than IR.  Using RF would dramatically increase the frequency of battery replacement, unless a rechargeable battery solution was provided with the remote - which would further drive up cost.  "},

{"title":"ELI5 the hate of the Romanov family and why they were executed by the Bolsheviks.","answer":"Various Romanov Tsars had German staff or married Germans, which made them unpopular during the time period (WWI). Also, the vast majority of them, apparently, were totally incompetent as rulers. Nicholas II took the throne, publicly saying he didn't want to be Tsar, and was not a politician in any sense.\n\nThe first Revolution of 1917 rolls around, and the country's having issues settling differences between the capitalist aims of the modern age and the antiquated policies and dealings of the autocracy. Combine this with WWI going on, (and the Russians aren't doing so well there), which is exacerbated by Nick II and his wife bungling stuff up like Russian Dan Quayle, and people are starting to get pissed. Then old Nicky decides he's going to command the Russian army, which sends people into a frenzy because 1) The Russians are failing at the war and the public doesn't support it. 2) Nicholas is a terrible general. 3) He's too busy sucking it up on the front lines to go home and suck it up as the leader of the country. \n\nBack home, who does Nicholas leave in charge of the country? A competent politician? Nah, he leaves his wife, Alexandra (German) to run stuff with her BFF, Rasputin. Rasputin's pretty unpopular, which definitely doesn't help Alexandra, who is about as effective at leading the country as her old man. Rasputin's killed and Alexandra starts naming Prime Ministers about as quickly as Taylor Swift changes boyfriends. \n\nMeanwhile, the people are getting poorer, famine's hitting the land, refugees are pouring in from the German-occupied areas of Russia, and the economy starts to collapse because the Russians are cut off from the world markets. Parliament's coming up with solutions to fix everything, and Nicholas II is straight up ignoring them. The Parliament now hates him, the armed forces think he's a moron, the public thinks he's a jerk, and people are starting to revolt in the streets. Nicholas is no one's friend.

{"title":"ELI5: Uses of Capacitors","question_detail":"So I've done a little bit of research (including in this subreddit), and I think I understand what capacitors do. From what I've read, they build up charge when they receive voltage and discharge when not given a voltage. If this is an incorrect definition, please help me understand!\n\nAnyway, I want to know what the practical uses of capacitors, particularly in simple DC circuits that I could create on my own, would be. I know they can be used to convert AC to DC, but I've also seen them across motors and in some other situations. Please explain these to me. Thanks for any responses!","answer":"Dsampson92 has a really good explanation, but I'll add just a couple things.\n\nFirst of all, a capacitor only passes current when the voltage changes, so a capacitor can be used to prevent DC current from passing through a particular path in a circuit.\n\nAnother interesting application of capacitance is the [condenser microphone.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condenser_mic#Condenser_microphone) These are common in recording and are actually used in most cell phones, although cell phones use a subset of condenser microphones known as electret microphones.  A condenser microphone biases two plates with a given voltage, and fixes the plates parallel to each other. One of the plates, known as the diaphragm is allowed to move in response to pressure fluctuations in the air (sound). As the diaphragm plate moves, the distance between it and the fixed plate changes, hence the capacitance changes. As the capacitance changes, current flows in and out of the plates. The waveform of this current is used as an electrical analog of the acoustic wave."},

There are no obese people in Somalia. There were no chubby jews in Auschwitz-Birkenau.\n\nHowever, for some people, a regular diet is not enough for them to lose weight.\n\nThere reasons for that are a few: their bodies have a genetic predisposition to accumulate fat, but more importantly these bodies have a very high level of what is considered \"minimal acceptable amount of fat\".\nWhenever a person with such predisposition attempts to lose further weight, the metabolism goes into crisis mode and slows down tremendously, making further progress nearly impossible short of starvation ( which slows down the metabolism further).\n\nFor people with such predisposition, especially in the extreme end, nothing short of a perfect diet on lean proteins and vegetables coupled with exercise will allow them to diet down to \"perfect shape\".\n\nBecause this lifestyle requires so much discipline... and high-carb, high-sugar food is so delicious and addictive... the likelihood of that person achieving success is very low.\n\n\nELI5: Some people's bodies don't like being thin... they like to save fat because bodies eat fat in tough times when there's nothing to eat and some bodies are scared that some day there will be no food so they like to save up fat just in case.

{"title":"ELI5: What is rebait?","question_detail":"I don't know what it is or how it works, but I think it's a US only thing? Can someone explain? ","answer":"A rebate is an amount of money that a buyer gets back after purchasing something, for some reason. It is not the same as a refund. It's more like having something be on sale or discount, but you have to pay the full price first and get the difference back later.\n\nOften, this is because the company who makes the product wants to have a sale, but they don't want to force the stores that sell the product to participate. So, they offer a system where you can mail your receipt or other proof of purchase to the manufacturer and they will mail you back some money. This is often called specifically a \"manufacturer's rebate\".\n\nSometimes people buy an item because of the rebate, but forget to mail in the proof of purchase, or don't do it correctly. This is good for the company that makes the product, because they got a sale they normally wouldn't have, at full price.\n\nSome stores have started offering what's called an \"instant rebate\", which means you don't have to mail anything in and the price is lowered at the time you pay, just like a normal sale or discount. Sometimes this is a sale by the store, other times it is the store who then contacts the manufacturer to get the rebate, saving the customer the time and effort of mailing in the proof."},

{"title":"ELI5: Is fluoride helpful or harmful?","question_detail":"I've been raised with conventional modern Western medicine/dentistry and have always used fluoride toothpaste. I've never had any reason to question the use of fluoride in tap water. My wife, on the other hand, grew up in Japan where fluoride toothpaste is less common and fluoride is not added to water. As we raise our kids, my wife is insisting that, since fluoride is a poison in large doses, it's best not to use it in toothpaste, etc.\n\nI tried to do some research to refute her claims definitively but the Wikipedia page on fluoride gives equal treatment to the pros and cons. Other sites like [Nonfluoridetoothpaste.org](http://www.nonfluoridetoothpaste.org) and articles like [this](http://www.consumerhealth.org/articles/display.cfm?ID=19990303222823) provide evidence to support my wife's position, but I'm not familiar enough with the underlying science to call BS on anything.\n\nMy wife acknowledges that if we were to ask a dentist, they would recommend using toothpaste, since their primary concern is the strength of their patients' teeth, but she feels that if you look at it in terms of the entire person, fluoride is a net negative. She contends that it's not so much the fluoride in the toothpaste as it is the act of brushing itself that is most important.\n\nSo who's right? Are there any definitive articles or studies that I can show that answer this question definitively? Or does her perspective have some merit? I try not to stick to a position just for the sake of defending my position, so if it turns out she's right, I'm happy to eat crow. :)","answer":"I should note that this question breaks the âDonât be a Walterâ rule. /r/explainlikeimfiveELI5 is meant to explain things you donât know, not confirm or deny biases. At any rate, though, your wifeâs concerns are not unprecedented.\n\nFirstly, 97% of Europe rejects fluoridated water. Germany regards it as being problematic, for instance, while Luxembourg and Belgium both agree that water is not the medium in which medicinal treatments should be provided. In the United States, fluoride is regarded as an âunapproved drugâ by the FDA, even though some areas use fluoridated water. Fluoride is naturally produced, in very small amounts, in many sources. From our daily diets, we are most likely ingesting trace amounts of fluoride. However, the use of it in water is quoted by many to put us at 300% of what the American Dental Association deems acceptable, which is 0.7 â 1.2 parts per million. This is indeed confusing, because in 2006, the ADA advised against parents giving their children, especially infants, fluoridated water. They recanted shortly after, but others have brought up the same issues.\n\nThe big idea is that no one knows enough about it to know whether it is fully safe or not. Dental fluorosis is a risk, which is a permanent tooth defect that harms the cells that develop teeth. Children are more susceptible to this. A medical journal also noted that fluoride may damage the developing brain, and cause learning deficits among other cognitive issues. Scientists at Harvard found that elevated levels of fluoride exposure during early childhood have repeatedly been correlated with reduced IQ.\n\nThe noted risks of fluoride are far more prevalent and supported than the theory that it is entirely safe, especially regarding water fluoridation. The key to administering a medicinal substance to a person is knowing how much is enough, and how much is too much. This system of administration is considered unethical or unnecessary by many governmentâs, including the US, though the US is not as firm with its regulation against it.\n\nYou can think about it this way:\n\nIf fluoride is being added to water to help reduce tooth decay, and improve bone strength, it is being considered a medicinal solution to common problems. All medicine needs a dosage according to the numerous factors of the user. When water is fluoridated, everyone in the area is getting the same dose. This does not make sense medically, because you would not prescribe a five year old the same thing you would prescribe a thirty year old, and so on. This is why European governments suggest that if fluoride is needed in a personâs diet, they contact their physician, who can assess their situation and prescribe something suitable to them.\n\nYour wifeâs concerns are valid, though your skepticism is as well. Clearly it is your choice, as a couple, what to risk with your children. I would consider whether you would prefer to be safe rather than sorry, in this case. There are numerous counts against fluoride. Iâm afraid I cannot find a reference for this piece of information in particular, but my mother said that it was found as a tooth whitener by way of some third-world people drinking fluoridated water. The water was fluoridated because of a local plant, I believe nuclear was what she said, that the fluoride was a by-product of. It does have ingredients that are included in things like fertilizer, as well. It isnât completely solidly found to be entirely harmful, but it is not proven to be safe either. There is more information and evidence pointing at it being harmful, though."},

Basically, there are mathematical ways to turn a big number (like a one-megabyte chunk of a file) into a small number (say, 16 bytes) that are sensitive to small changes (like missing a few bytes of that file).

If you make $50,000 in NYC, then your income might really look like $25,000 in terms of what you can purchase with it.  So, your income with PPP would be $25,000.

There is a great deal of editing involved, including post-processing, profile matching/soft proofing, and scores of test prints. However, when just ordering prints from the grocery store print kiosk, a blanket set of processing instructions is run over your files and they're printed as if they were no different from the next guy's photos.\n\nFor future reference: \n\n* Megapixel count dictates the maximum size you can print at. 5mp is good for 4x5, 8mp is good for 8x10, etcetera.

Also, while copyright lasts a very long time, it does run out eventually. If you keep paying for a trade mark, you can keep it forever (as long as you use it regularly).\n\nAlso, trademarks also protect more than just your mark. Trade marks protect you from things that don't copy your mark, but just look or sound similar, so you can control more things than just what you registered."},

{"title":"ELI5: How does a flight go missing?","answer":"They can go off the radar of radar towers (mostly found around airports, some scattered about the world). Smaller planes in particular may not have the equipment to boost a signal far enough to reach a tower, so they can be lost on the map, with only the record that they left as proof that they are in the air. Larger, commercial aircraft are more carefully monitored, but they can still be 'lost' if travelling across a large area of no connectivity (middle of a large ocean, for example). "},
{"title":"ELI5: The use of Recursion in programming","answer":"More fundamentally, recursive functions in CS are the set of functions, where output is determined by:\n1. a base case\n2. a reduction of the input to the base case.\n\nSo it is not actually necessary for a function to call itself. For example, consider\n\n    odd(n){\n        if(n == 1){\n            return False\n        }elseif(n == 0){\n            return True\n        }else{\n            return even(n - 1)\n    }\n\n    even(n){\n        if(n == -1){\n            return False\n        }elseif(n == 0){\n            return True\n        }else{\n            return odd(n - 1)\n    }\n\nNowhere does odd or even call itself. This is mutual recursion. In fact you can define any simple recursive function without self calls if you invoke a fixed point combinator."},
{"title":"What is this \"Fiscal Cliff\" the news keeps talking about?","answer":"Do you remember months ago when America was going to default? It was all over the news last spring. Republicans didn't want to extend our debt and were going to have us default unless stronger budget cuts were made. The problem was that Congress couldn't agree on what to cut. It's easy to say, \"cut spending!\" It's not easy to decide what programs to actually cut.\n\nThey came to a decision--if they could not decide what items to cut by the end of the year, the Department of Defense (our biggest spending area) would *automatically* take a huge hit. That threat was supposed to make it so Republicans and Democrats would make tough decisions in order to avoid those huge cuts.\n\nThe problem is that Congress still hasn't decided on how to balance the budget. Democrats want to help balance it by letting tax breaks to the wealthy Americans expire; Republicans are against any tax increases. Republicans want to focus on cutting spending, but they won't say what to cut. If they don't compromise, the Department of Defense will see huge cuts, and *all* Americans will lose some tax breaks and see their taxes go up."},
{"title":"CPU and GPU bottlenecks","question_detail":"i just dont understand what either of them are/how they come about. THANK YOU IN ADVANCE","answer":"Think of your computer as an assembly line, with several different workers. It's producing images. Each worker has a different job to do, and each can't work on an image until the previous worker has finished with it. When the last worker (the GPU) finishes, it puts the image on your screen. If every worker can handle at least 60 images per second, you get 60 frames per second. However, if even one worker can't keep up, everybody else has to wait for them, and the framerate suffers.\n\nMore specifics:\n\nGPU and CPU are responsible for different things in a game. In the simple cases, they do almost completely different work.\n\nAs you might expect, the GPU will usually mostly handle drawing things to the screen. It accepts commands to draw shapes and textures, and it generates the image. It can sometimes do some other stuff, but this is the simple case.\n\nThe CPU does everything else. It has to handle everything that goes on in whatever game you're playing. It handles all the enemy's behavior, it calculates bullet trajectories. It might have to do physics calculations. And then, after all that is done, it has to send the drawing instructions to the GPU.\n\nConsider that computers display things as frames. For one frame to be drawn, two things have to happen first: the CPU has to do all the work and determine what needs to be drawn, and the GPU has to draw it. If the CPU takes too long to do its work, the GPU doesn't get its instructions, and your framerate drops. If the GPU can't keep up with the group, less frames are produced, and again your framerate drops.\n\nIt's not really possible to simply say that your computer has a CPU or a GPU bottleneck, because it depends on the software. Some games will require more GPU power than others, and some will require more CPU power than others. Perhaps in a game that has crazy awesome graphics but is actually very very simple, your GPU would be the bottleneck. Using the same computer, playing a game that does complex simulations but has simplistic graphics, the CPU could be the bottleneck. With yet another game that deals with extremely large amounts of data, your memory could even be the bottleneck (this probably almost never happens)."},
{"title":"ELI5: Why do we enjoy things that are bad for us?","question_detail":"Originally my question was just to address just food. We all love to stuff ourselves with all kinds of foodstuffs packed with copious amounts of things that are bad for us (sugar, salt, fat etc.). We also love to eat too much, often making ourselves overweight. Also, alcohol and other recreational (and illegal I guess) drugs can come into this too.

(yeah, I really need to work); relationships - sometimes you can find yourself, wanting the person who is the worst person you could possibly have a relationship with (maybe because they're a bad person, or they cheat a lot, or sleep around or a multitude of factors); spending money - we all love a good spending spree, and yet, wouldn't it be better if we saved our money until the end of the month for when we're struggling for cash to buy our basic living requirements?; bit of a weird one but everyone hears the stories, of celebrities etc. who are found hanging naked after erotic asphyxiation, this has ended up killing them, and yet it apparently feels great (otherwise, why would they do it?).\n\nThere are so many other examples I could make but I'm tired.

So, for example, if you have a website about red shoes, you want both the word \"red\" and the word \"shoes\" to appear on it a lot, so people searching for red things or for shoes can find it. But you also want the phrase \"red shoes\" to show up with the words close together, so that people specifically searching for those two words will find it.\n\nSearch engines also often care about links. If lots of sites about shoes link to your Red Shoe site, you'll be more likely to show up in searches about shoes."},

If you do something often enough (like riding the bus), your body's internal clock will know when you usually start moving and get off the bus, so you'll wake up, knowing that you must do something. The same principle applies to any ritual activity.

{"title":"Some physics questions: spectrums and blackbodies","question_detail":"What is the difference between a continuous spectrum and a discrete spectrum?\n\nWhat is a blackbody?","answer":"First off, the plural of \"spectrum\" isn't \"spectrums\", it's \"spectra\".\n\nIf you don't know the meaning of \"discrete\" and \"continuous\", basically:\n\nIntegers (whole numbers: 1, 2, 3 etc) are discrete, meaning they can only take on certain values.\n\nReal numbers (like 1.52, the square root of 2, pi, etc) are a continuous range, because they can take an infinite amount of possible values between any two different numbers - there is an infinity of real numbers between 1 and 2, just like there is an infinity of real numbers between 1 and 1.0000000001 . This is a continuous range.\n\nA continuous spectrum is one in which both the frequency and intensity axes are, well, continuous - which is to say, they can take any possible value. A good example is the emission spectrum of a heated black body.\n\n[Here](http://i.imgur.com/2ywtU.jpg)'s an example of a continuous spectrum. As you can see, both axes are defined for continuous values.\n\nA discrete spectrum, however is one in which only certain frequencies and intensities are possible. A good example would be the emission spectra of atoms, which have \"emission lines\" on certain, known frequencies.\n\n[Here](http://i.imgur.com/HSYZr.jpg)'s an example of  some discrete spectra - namely, the emission spectra of Hydrogen, Neon and Mercury. As you can see, the frequencies aren't continuous, there are sharp lines at certain frequencies and that's it.\n\nAnd, a black body is simply an idealised physical object that is, as the name implies, perfectly black. It absorbs all incoming radiation and doesn't reflect any of it. If heated above 0K, it emits black body radiation."},

{"title":"ELI5: Ideal Gas Law.","answer":"Like you're Five (and not a chemist):\n\nImagine you have a balloon in a warm room, that you've blown up and tied, so no airâ  can enter or leave: the number of air \"molecules\" doesn't change.  The balloon exerts a fairly constant Pressure on the air inside the balloon, since the air outside the balloon has a constant pressureâ .  If you take the ballon from the warm room inside, to the cold outside, the balloon will shrink.  Why?  Because the Ideal Gas Law says  \"pressure(P) times volume(V) is proportional to the number of molecules(n) times temperature(T)\".\n\nIn this case, the pressure and number of molecules stayed the same, but the temperature dropped.  Since nT dropped, that means PV also has to drop.  And since P remained constant, V has to drop to compensate.\n\nFor another example, say you have a helium-filled weather balloon; you release the balloon, and it rises so far that there is less air.  What happens?   In this case, the Pressure is reduced, since there's less air way up in the sky, the number of molecules inside the balloon doesn't change, and while the temperature probably does change, it's not as significant as the pressure change, so we can ignore that for now.  Again, the law says  PV ~ nT, so since the Pressure is reduced, the Volume will have to increase.  If the volume increases enough, the balloon will pop.\n\nâ  This isn't exactly true, of course, but this ELI5, not ELI15."},

The gist of it is that scientists in Europe have discovered a new form of alien energy that is being emitted from \"portals\" around the global.\n\nEveryone is divided into two factions: those who want to learn more about how to use the energy (the Enlightened), and those who think it's too dangerous (the Resistance). \n\nStatues, public areas, and pieces of art in your city serve as \"portals\". Basically, you physically walk to a portal and claim it for your faction (Resistance or Enlightenment). An enemy can then take it from you, and you can take it from them, and so on. The goal is to control as many portals as possible.\n\nAs your faction gains control of more portals, you can \"link\" the portals you control together. This just places a line on the map between the portals, and connects them. The line is destroyed if the portal on either side of it is taken by the opposing faction.\n\nIf you connect three portals into a triangle, you create a \"field\". Fields color the triangle-shaped-area on the map in your faction's color, and represent the area covered as people on your side.\n\nSo, basically, across the world everyone is trying to cover as much of the map in fields of their faction's color, to \"convince\" the world to side with them on their decision of what to do with the energy (embrace it or oppose it). \n\nThe story is still progressing, and is entirely influenced by which faction controls a larger part of the globe (with fields).\n\n\n"},

I know that a prisoner in the United States is much more likely to go back to jail than one in some European countries and I'm wondering why that is. ","answer":"One of the main reasons people go to jail in the US is probation violations.  When someone gets convicted of a crime, they are often have to complete a period of probation after they get out of prison.  Probation is like regular life, but with more rules.  As an example, a common condition of probation is meeting with your probation officer.  Miss too many of those meetings, and you go back to prison, even though you haven't even committed a new crime.  A probation violation counts as a new conviction, and you can be sent back to prison.   Though there are some very good things about probation, it is one thing that contributes to the revolving door aspect of America's criminal justice system. "},

Formula One cars have a power to weight ratio of 1,250 hp/t (0.93 kW/kg), while a Kia Sedona (Minivan) has a ratio of 136.59 bhp/ton.\n\nTorque is a measure of force, specifically twisting force. TORQUE = FORCE x DISTANCE. Torque is usually expressed in ft.-lbs. or N*m. Having a lot of torque means your engine can put a lot of force out to the tires.

{"title":"ELI5: File sharing/digital copyright legality in the U.S.","question_detail":"Is it all legal and just discouraged cause of production companies? Why does my internet provider send me warnings about file sharing? Is there any real threat of legal action?","answer":"Like /u/Amarkov said, acquiring or distributing copyrighted files is illegal. No government agencies bother trying to catch individual downloaders, because it happens so often and they can make a bigger difference catching or shutting down the websites or website owners instead. This is well known, hence all the civil lawsuits by media companies.\n\nYour internet provider doesn't want you to download copyrighted files illegally because they don't want to be associated with your illegal activity, in some cases they are even owned by the same media company that makes the stuff being downloaded illegally. Media companies have tried to make congresscritters pass laws to make illegal downloading be investigated and punished more by the government, but so far haven't had a ton of luck. On the other hand, they have tried to appeal to the internet providers themselves with voluntary agreements, like the incoming \"six-strikes\" rules. \n\nMedia companies find people to sue by getting IP addresses, through tactics like joining torrent swarms or getting lists from website administrators, looking up which ISP gives out those IP addresses, and then demanding the ISP tell them who they are, through a mass lawsuit or otherwise. Often these lawsuits come with an offer - agree to never download anything illegally again, pay the media company some thousands of dollars (less than it would be to hire a lawyer), and sign a non-disclosure agreement that is a promise for you not to say that you were threatened with a lawsuit by the media company.

{"title":"Tagged vs untagged on VLANS?","answer":"The way that a physical network LAN is separated into logical networks (VLANs) is to add an identifier to each packet that traverses the network.  \n\nThe difference between a tagged VLAN and an untagged VLAN is whether or not the switch allows you to see/use that tagging information.  On an untagged VLAN (which most are), the switch will strip the 802.1Q VLAN header from packets that it send and ignore them when it sees them coming from other devices.  On tagged VLANs, which are used between pieces of network equipment that need to see more than one VLAN, 801.1Q headers are recognized and used; a host/device can 'tag\" which network a packet is for.  Untagged packets sent on a tagged VLAN will have a tag added to them that places them on the \"default\" VLAN.\n"},

Wages, which are actually just the price for labour, don't go down easily (because of labour laws, among other reasons); this usually makes a recession last longer than it would otherwise have to.\n\nAnother price which should go down is that of the currency of the country in recession. In a country like Spain, which uses the euro, that is not possible because it is also the currency of Germany, which has a much stronger economy. And, in Spain, labour laws are very rigid; this is why more than half of the young people are unemployed and its economy is struggling so hard to get out of recession."},

{"title":"How do those modern bows with the pulleys work?","answer":"There's three major advantages at work here. \n\n1) A compound bow is made out of awesome composite materials capable of storing more potential energy than a traditional wooden bow.\n\n2) The pulley/cam system makes it easier for you to draw the string. Basically, your goal is the compress the limbs (move the top limb and bottom limb closer together). With a traditional bow - you are pulling both limbs closer to you to apply force to the limb. With the compound setup, the pulleys and cams work toward pushing as much of your effort in the desired direction as possible (you pull back still, but the pulley lets a significantly larger portion of your effort apply direct up/down force to the limbs). \n\n3) The cams allow for significant let-off; with a traditional bow if the draw weight of the bow is 50 lbs and I draw it back, I'm holding that 50 lbs worth of tension the entire time I have the bow at full draw. The cams allow me to drop a portion of that weight off at full draw; in the case of my bow, it's an 80% let-off. That's enormous; I have mine tuned to around 60lbs draw weight, but at full draw it feels like a 12 lb draw. This makes it significantly easier to hold steady on the target and really take your time aiming. \n\nSo, in the end you have a bow that can store more potential energy in the limbs - it takes you less effort to compress those limbs - and you can be significantly more physically relaxed at full draw."},
{"title":"ELI5: How do p-n junctions work within solar cells?","question_detail":"I have a vague idea of how a p-n junction is set up, but I'm not sure how solar energy fits into the diagrams I've been seeing. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/lxbcG.png?1) is what I'm talking about in regards to a basic diagram. \n\nThanks for any input!","answer":"Lets start at the beginning: energy diagrams. A single atom has many different energy levels, and their respective electron orbitals, where electrons can be found. When two atoms come near each other, their atomic orbitals interact and split into a lower energy bonding orbital and a higher energy anti bonding orbital. When another atom interacts, we get even more splits and more energies for their electrons to settle into. Now we can extend this concept to metals and note that with moles of atoms these multiplying number of energy levels become less and less discrete (for sake of calculation) and we see the arrival of energy bands, where all of the bonding orbital energies are located somewhere in a low energy range and all the antibonding orbitals are somewhere in a higher range.\n\nThese ranges are called bands and are the explanation for the semiconductive qualities of semiconductors. A non-doped semiconductor is a metal lattice with a band gap (the empty space between the low and high energy bands). At low temperatures, electrons don't have enough energy to jump across the band gap from the low state to the high state, but as the temperature increases it becomes easier and conduction (the flow of electrons) becomes possible. [note, that because these are bands, the energy level jumps are from atom to atom, not from an atom to itself.] \n\nNow comes the issue of doping, this is what the process is called when metal impurities are added into a base metal in order to achieve desired effects. An n-type [negative] semiconductor is one where electrons are added into the band gap just under the high energy levels. This allows the electrons from the impurity metal to be able to conduct through the base metal, because not a lot of energy is required for the jump. Conversely, p-type semiconductors [positive] are those which  add in an impurity that has its own empty higher energy levels just above the low energy band of the base metal. This allows the electrons from the base metal to only need a small amount of energy to jump from its low energy state to the high energy state of the p-impurity.\n\nNow, when we put p- and n-type semiconductors together we get what is called a p-n junction. Essentially what this does is create a diode. This results because if you connect a positive terminal to the p side and a negative terminal to the n side, then the electrons in the n will go towards the p and 'cascade' down the energy bands, while if you switch the polarities, the electrons in the p can not jump up high enough to cause conduction into the n-type conductor. \n\nNow what happens in a solar cell is that photons from sunlight are absorbed by the p-type portion of the cell. This does two things, firstly, it excites an election to an energy state proportional to the energy of the photon absorbed, ideally this is to an energy high enough that the p-type ends up conducting an electron into the n-type. Secondly this excitation creates something called an electron hole, which is nothing more than saying that where there used to be an electron/bond there is no longer. This (relatively positive) hole then induces other electrons in the p-type to fill in that hole and 'conducts' the hole away from the junction and through the circuit. \n\nYou have to think of current as what it is (all electrons moving simultaneously and not one by one) in order to see that the end result of this process is the omni directional conduction of electrons flowing from the p to the n and across the circuit to fill in the holes they meet being conducted in the opposite direction from the p-type across the circuit. \n\nHopefully, this helped clear some stuff up. I'm a chemist so I hope I didn't focus too much on the quantum explanation, in the more-than-off chance you wanted an explanation from an engineering perspective haha."},

{"title":"ELI5: The founding of Israel. How, When, and Why?","question_detail":"I know it had something to do with the UN voting to take land from Palestine and make Israel or something like that. I need clarification and extention.","answer":"From the late 1800s to early 1900s, the Zionist movement became popular among Jewish people in Europe and America. This movement was about gathering the Jews, which had been scattered all over the world for hundreds/thousands of years, back to one place, so that they could be one people again. The preferred place to gather for many was Palestine, ancestral home of the Jews, which at that time was part of the Ottoman Empire (modern Turkey).\n\nDuring WWI, Palestine was occupied by the British because the Ottoman Empire was allied with Germany. After the war, the League of Nations (first attempt at the UN) told the Brits to just keep looking after Palestine (called the British Mandate for Palestine). By this time, a lot of Jews had moved to Palestine, and part of the LoN mandate to the British was to make sure they had a place of their own. The Arabs didn't like this, because to them, the Jews were just immigrants, why should they get a country of their own. (Think Mexican immigrants in New Mexico/Texas. Their ancestors used to live in that area a long time ago, but that doesn't mean anything to the people currently living there.)\n\nAfter WWII, sympathy was with the Zionists for obvious reason, and they had a lot of support from America, both moral and financial. The UN came up with a plan to divide Palestine into an Arab part, and Israel. The land area was about equal, though ~33% of the population was Jewish, and 45% of the Arabs were living on what was to become Israel. Jerusalem was to be administered by the UN.\n\nWhen the plan passed, the Arabs rejected it, and Jews had a lukewarm reaction. Violence started, first on small scale, then larger. On the night that the Mandate ended and Britain gave up control of Palestine, Israel declared itself a state. Hundreds of thousands of middle and upper class Palestinians fled Israeli territory, and many of these people and their descendants today are still refugees. Surrounding Arab nations invaded, sort of. They didn't want Israel to exist and would have preferred an Arab Palestine, but more than anything they each wanted Palestine for themselves.\n\nWithin a few months, the Israelis were completely victorious, thanks to their superior organization and funding (mostly from people in the United States). Israel held all of the land the UN had promised, plus 60% of what was supposed to be the Palestinian Arabs. The rest was held by Egypt or Jordan. \n\nSince then, there have been a few wars between Israel and its Arab neighbors, with a little land changing hands, but it's basically been the same ever since.\n\nI took all of this information for half a dozen Wikipedia articles and what my wife has told me (she has a master's in IR and diplomacy, focused on the middle east). I can post the wiki articles is there is demand."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why does my stomach feel cold after exercising? ","answer":"When you're exercising your body needs oxygen in your muscles, be it your arms, legs, back etc.\n\nThe way to get oxygen there is through blood flow. Blood carries oxygen along to the muscles, so if more oxygen is needed in your muscles your body can simply pump more blood there. The downside to this is that you have a limited amount of blood, so if more is pumped to your arms and legs, less is going around your stomach area.\n\nAll living cells need energy to run, to do the things they do; They also conveniently produce heat as a by-product. They can get this energy from your blood. Less blood going through your stomach reduces the supply of energy to the cells in your stomach area, so they do less work and produce less heat.\n\nThis is also why you shouldn't eat before exercising; Your body will want to digest food, but also get oxygen to your muscles. This reduces the amount of blood in your muscles which causes anaerobic respiration, resulting in a build up of lactic acid, and thus causes cramps. Digestion speed is also reduced, so you're really half-assing two jobs at once. Full-ass one thing at a time."},

{"title":"ELI5: confidence intervals in statistics. How can a relatively small sample size provide accurate results for a large group of people?","answer":"Let's say you flip a coin 100 times, and you get 50 heads and 50 tails. If you throw the same coin 1000 times, how many tails and how many heads will you get? What if you roll a million times?\n\nNow try a coin that came out head 35 times, and tail the other 65. How many tails will you get out of 1000 throws? And how many will you get out of a million throws?\n\nOnce you figured out that the first coin is balanced, you can just go ahead and predict that you'll get an even split between heads and tails for any number of coin flips, be it a thousand or a million. What matters is that you're confident that the coin is balanced. Likewise, if you can ascertain that the coin is biased with 100 flips, the bias will be the same with however many flips you try.\n\nThat should explain why small samples suffice for conclusions about big populations. There's just a couple of issues left with that.\n\nOne is that you have to make sure the sample is representative of the population as a whole. That gives you something of a minimum sample size.\n\nAnother is the confidence. Imagine you get, say, 48/52 heads/tails. Is this because the coin is slightly biased, or is it just a random occurrence from a balanced coin? Well, if you got a 480/520 flips out of 1000 throws, you'd feel a bit more confident that the coin is actually biased, and it wasn't just a freak occurrence. 4800/5200 out of 10,000? Yeah, definitely biased. The more samples you have, the more confident you are about your estimate for the true probability. The confidence interval is basically a formalisation of this concept."},

Why wouldn't the person just be paralyzed? Or, is it one of those fictional Hollywood things that wouldn't actually happen in real life?","answer":"Just to note that a very few people have actually survived an \"internal decapitation\", in which the skull is not connected to the spine. This is why rescue personnel use body boards and are very careful moving people in a car crash: even the slightest movement can damage nerves and cause paralysis or death. \n\nAlso, a \"proper\" hanging should break the neck and dislocate the spinal cord, causing instant death. A hanging is not intended to suffocate the person, which would be a very slow and agonizing death. "},
{"title":"ELI5: Plebgate","question_detail":"I stumbled upon Plebgate this morning while reading the BBC, but I don't think I understand what is going on? Is it really about some high up politician allegedly calling a police officer a \"pleb\"?","answer":"Andrew Mitchell was accused by the police of calling them \"plebs\". He denied this. He did admit to swearing at them. The police put the original accusation in their official logs. Then, someone sends an email to Andrew Mitchell's deputy further accusing him (Mitchell )of using the word \"pleb\" and adding that members of the public who were there overheard this,and were visibly shocked. This someone turned out to be another police officer. However, Channel 4 TV broadcast CCTV pictures showing the area at the time, and there were no members of the public to be seen. Cameron knew all this, but kept quiet for reasons as yet unknown. Another person, also unknown, has also been arrested and the investigation is still going on.  Also, Mitchell had a meeting with the Police Federation ( a kind of police union) where he explained everything that happened. Directly after that meeting, the police federation spokesman claimed that Mitchell refused to say what had happened,but Mitchell had secretly recorded that meeting, and the tapes were also broadcast on TV where he is heard explaining that yes, he did swear, but said he never used the word Pleb.

{"title":"Set Theory ","question_detail":"Can someone explain Cantor's Set Theory as painlessly as possible while still conveying its importance? \nThanks!","answer":"So, imagine you were going to explain to someone what a house is. You'd probably start by explaining the idea of it. Shelter from the elements, etc. In not too long of a time you'll be talking about the layout of a house. Living rooms, bedrooms, etc. Eventually, you're talking about it for a long enough time, you'll have to talk about the really specific things. Plumping, the foundation, frame, etc.\n\nThis is essentially the history of mathematics. In the beginning of math, we cared very much about the big picture, and the things we would actually see and encounter, like geometry. But, you keep talking about stuff long enough and you get into the real fine details. \n\nThat's where set theory comes in. Just like at the end of your explanation of a house you have a language of certain \"atomic\" things, like wood beams, pipes, etc, the end of the explanation of math must also turn to some atomic basis from which everything is built. \n\nMany people take this to be the idea of sets. Sets are just collections of things. Since in a foundational sense everything is a set, sets are really just sets of sets (which themselves are sets!, etc). We know of one set, which is the set with nothing in it. And we have an expectation of what we can do with sets, like we can take two sets and form a new set of the elements from each. We can take two sets and make a new set with those two things in it. And there's lots of other rules. We can even postulate the existence of an infinite set.  \n\nSets are a very basic, intuitive idea which we can write down some non-controversial rules for and \"do\" all of math. Now, some people don't want sets to be the foundational language of mathematics. Some would prefer that arithmetic should be, and others prefer assignments (functions in math-speak) should be. \n\nRegardless, set theory is the current language for describing the nuts and bolts of mathematics. Lots of mathematicians don't touch the nuts and bolts though. "},

In the context of the book, the phrase was written by the character Claire Minton to explain that Americans are not always loved in other countries, and that they are always looking for some new frontier to conquer.\n\nIMHO: Perhaps Americans, being pioneers in their own right, are always pushing to understand and to be understood; seeking understanding and love, where there is none to be had."},

{"title":"ELI5: Ockham's/Occam's Razor","question_detail":"No matter how many times I look this up, I fail to grasp what it is, much less how it's used properly.","answer":"Most formulations of Occam's razor are a bit problematic. Firstly, the classical formulation that states \"entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity\" is obviously true but not very helpful. Everyone agrees that one should not assume more than what is necessary when trying to explain something, but people disagree about what entities are necessary!\n\nNowadays the versions of Occam's razor that are floating around have little to do with Occam's (a medieval philosopher) concerns, rather they are  broader principles of simplicity. What kind of simplicity? Usually some kind of simplicity when it comes to explanations (theories about how things hang together). In the replies here we see a variety of answers: do not make too many assumptions, if you have two explanations the simpler one is usually correct, the fewer assumptions a theory has the more correct it is. Deciding on a good definition of simplicity is important, but also quite tricky. Why should theories with *fewer* assumptions be simpler? Sometimes adding assumptions to theories might make them quite a lot easier to state. And why should we think that theories with fewer assumptions might have a higher chance of being correct? There are different answers to these questions, but at the time there is no consensus of how to best define theoretical simplicity."},

{"title":"Can someone explain caches in computers?","question_detail":"Can someone explain caches in computers?","answer":"Copy/paste of a previous answer:\n\nThe memory of a computer is a place that can store information. The CPU (the \"brain\" on the computer) will read information from memory, perform an operation on that information, and store the result, again, in memory.\n\nCache is a form of memory that is smaller but faster than regular memory. The computer tries to use cache memory for the information it uses most often. There can be several levels of cache, each smaller but faster than the next. These levels are called L1, L2, L3 etc.\n\n**!! METAPHOR HAPPY TIME !!**\n\nLet's say you want to write a paper on a specific topic, but the internet is down for some reason and you have to rely on books from a library. The library is like the main memory of a computer.\n\nIf you had to go to the library each time you need to check something in a book, your paper would take forever. But what you can do is borrow some of the books from the library and store them on a bookshelf at home. That way, if you need one of these books you can go and fetch it. You don't need to go to the library as often now.\n\nBut getting up from your desk to go and take a book from the bookshelf still takes some time. So you pick up a couple of books at once and bring them to your desk. Your desk is too small to put all the books from the shelves on it, but whichever book you keep there will be readily available.\n\nThose are like levels of cache. The book that's open in front of your eyes is like the first cache level (L1): it's the information you are currently processing. Other books on your desk are the second cache level (L2): still readily available but limited to a few books. The bookshelf is like the third cache level (L3): more information available but it requires you to get up so it takes more time. The library is like main memory: significantly slower, but holding much more information.\n"},
{"title":"ELI5: Ammunition sizes.  Bullets and such...","question_detail":"For example, what is the difference between like a 308 and a 30-06?  Why are they called 30- aught- six?  Why are some in mm and some measured in decimals? Thanks in advance...","answer":"The aught question is well answered, so I'll tackle the mm/caliber one more in-depth.\n\nThe simple answer is that they are two different standards for the same measurements. A barrel's diameter can be roughly measured in millimeters, or in inches. A .50 caliber gun shoots a round that's half an inch across. This does not signify anything about the round other than the length across: a .50 caliber round can be the action-express pistol round or the full .50 caliber rifle round.\n\nThe .50 caliber provides a further example: the standard .50 BMG (machine gun) round can also be found under the title '12.7mm NATO'. They mean the same thing: .5 inches = 12.7mm, roughly.\n\nSome rounds are easier to express in mm than caliber. The .40 caliber S&amp;W is a well known revolver round, but less well known as the '10mm round'. The common 9mm round, on the other hand, would have to go under the name .355 caliber, which is a bit of a mouthful in comparison!\n\nOnce you go above .50 caliber, it's more common to find rounds marked in millimeters: The 25mm cannon round is well known to the US military, used in the Bushmaster cannons of the Bradley AFVs and some aircraft: in calibers, it would be 1.0 caliber, but it's never (or perhaps rarely) mentioned in this way. The 4.7 caliber round is better known as the 120mm tank round, used in US and English battle tanks.\n\nThe reason for higher-diameter rounds using millimeters rather than calibers is a more complex question. From [what I can tell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_pistol_and_rifle_cartridges), the US and England used predominantly calibers in measuring their rounds, whereas mainland Europe (Germany and Russia in particular) favored millimeters. This trend would be seen extensively in the second world war: the US favored .30 and .45 caliber, the Germans 9mm and 7.92mm rounds. England did something regarding the weight of their ammunition, and the Russians got really drunk. It is a question for historians then, if we abandoned caliber designations for cannon rounds for some significant reason: perhaps due to Russian and German tank divisions being the largest and most wide-spread forces in the war? Such as, after their widespread adoption of mm designations, it became the norm? \n\nSo, to wrap up this increasingly-poorly-designed-for-five-year-olds story, mm and caliber are the same measurement, just in either metric or inches, for the width of the barrel of the gun, and some bullets can be found in both caliber and mm names."},
{"title":"What can a netbook/chromebook do, and what can't it do?","question_detail":"I barely understand the difference. ","answer":"Netbooks and Chromebooks are two completely different things, completely different.\n\nNetbook are low cost, small laptops, generally they run some version of windows (or rarely linux) so you have your standard desktop and programs.  They are not very powerful (cpu-wise) laptops and are best used for web surfing, basic word processing, watching movies, music, etc. But no intensive tasks or gaming.\n\nChromebooks are laptops (generally small like a netbook) that run Google's ChromeOS as their operating system. This does NOT run windows or windows applications.  It has the same purpose as a netbook though, its for on-the-go websurfing, email, etc. IT is heavily focused to use web-based applications, not standalone stuff you install such as on a windows computer.  These are still in the early phases of development and few have been released.\n\nOf note, netbooks have mostly fallen out of favor, as they have been replaced by \"ultrabooks\" which are lightweight, compact, yet still quite powerful laptops, though they are more expensive, as well as being replaced with tablets such as the iPad. In hindsight, netbooks were an interim solution to portable computing, that we have since found better ways to do.\n"},

Now of course situations like this are best left to trained professionals but sometimes that just isn't an option. \n\nIt does become more difficult to learn to swim as you get older, because new neural connections (an oversimplification of how we learn) are not as easily made as you age. \"You can't teach an old dog new tricks\" holds some water here."},

{"title":"Tax returns","question_detail":"What are they? Why do we get money back?","answer":"Everyone has to pay income taxes, but you don't really know how much you owe until the end of the year.  That's because you might lose your job (or get a new job), you might win the lotto, you might win/lose in the stock market, you might give money to charity, you might have children, and so on.\n\nAll of these things affect how much you will owe in taxes.  So at the end of the year, you compile a \"report\" on all of the different things that happened in the previous year that affect how much you owe in taxes.  You send this report to the IRS (and possibly your equivalent State organization).\n\nNow, whenever you get a regular paycheck, your employer takes out a certain amount of money for taxes (this is called withholding).  Your employer really just takes a guess on how much you will owe in taxes based on the forms you filled out when you started your job (W-4, etc.).

{"title":"ELI5: How do ISPs and other Internet providers negotiate contracts to ensure that data gets sent to multiple servers along a stream at a desired speed?","question_detail":"Based on what little I know about this subject Internet providers can negotiate different kinds of relationships between other Internet providers. Those relationships are for the most part, from what little I know, either transit or peering relationships. Peering relationships are divided between settlement free peering and paid peering.\n \nI don't know if I am using the word Internet provider correctly but hopefully you know what I mean. \n\nHere is what is really confusing/intriguing me. Internet connections usually involve transmitting data across many Internet providers.\nWhile an Internet provider can make deals with those immediate providers (as I described) how can they ensure that their data which is transferred will take an overall route which is the fastest for the level they desire to be connected (based presumably on their budget)?\n\nLet's say a large content provider of video sends out their data to several Internet providers. By the time that data hops over five different providers it doesn't seem like the initial content provider has much control over the contractual deals which take place farther up stream.\n\nSo how does this work? Does the content provider pay multiple providers along the stream to ensure that their data gets the level of prioritization that it needs? How do they know that their data will be sent along a good path? Are Internet providers really never supposed to discriminate data packets based on their source? Do they really do that or are there a lot of under the table deals? Can they determine whether that data gets sent down a different stream, so to speak, based on its source?\n\nRemember to explain this to me as if I was 5.\n","answer":"From the context above and below, I think you're looking for why your internet , from the isp perspective is slow. \n\nFirst make sure you're talking Mb and MB, you get 1Mb/s upload, that's 0.125MB/s (8 bits in a Byte). ISP's talk about millions of bits, most apps talk more about millions of bytes. \n\nSecond ISP's setup and peer connections. \n\n* Bob owns a telephone company, he decides to start offering internet access.  Bob currently gets his internet access from AT&amp;T, he just calls them up and gets them to install a 155mbps line and he starts hooking up his telephone customers through that connection. \n\n* He just lets everyone have all they can eat and quickly torrent traffic starts to clog up the pipes. Customers complain that his network is too slow or say Netflix.\n\n* He realizes that this is no good, so he puts in a limit that every customer can only upload at 512kpbs and download at a meg or two. \n\n* Comcast comes in to his territory and starts offering 1mbps upload, and 25mbps download. He has to keep up or lose his customers.   He doesn't want to order another 155, they're really really expensive, so he starts to limit the traffic by type so that people trying to watch netflix get more priority than people downloading game updates. He also sets caps, he gives them the ability to download as fast as Comcast, but he makes sure that if they start using a lot of the resources, (download more than 100GB a month) they're charged, not so that he can pay for more bandwidth, but so that they'll stop downloading so much and he can keep his network as it is. \n\n* Bob's internet provision gets bigger and bigger and he notices that netflix is eating up most of his bandwidth.  He calls up netflix and negotiates a deal with them to get a direct connection to their content, netflix agrees to give him a good price on this connection because it's mutually beneficial.  He's just averted another crisis. \n\n* Eventually bob reallizes he can't just rely on AT&amp;T, if they go down he's up a creek, so he buys another 155 from BBN.  Now when you ask for joescofee.com bob's network knows whether it's closer to go out att or BBN and goes the right way.  But let's say that BBN is the shortes path, but it's  overused that day, his network will send you out att and around to joe's coffee.  Bob can manually fiddle with all this , but mostly it's handled automatically. \n\nThis is a gross oversimplification and a bit inaccurate but I think you'll get the general idea of what's at play.\n\nTL;DR  1. make sure you understand megabits your ISP is promising you and application on your computer that report speed in KilaBytes or MegaBytes instead of megabits. 2. You ISP may be too busy, or trying to protect their own network or the place you're trying to get to may be busy, it will all be automatically fixed as much as possibile if everything is set up correctly. \n\nedit:had an extra p\n"},

{"title":"Why are paparazzi allowed to do what they do?","question_detail":"How is it not considered harassment and stalking? I understand that people are allowed to take pictures in public and such, but it seems like the behaviour of a lot of these people is totally unacceptable. How are they even able to live with themselves knowing they make their living by ruining other people's days? ","answer":"It's a weird kind of symbiosis, and a bit of a circle-jerk.  A person becomes 'famous' from media exposure.  Photographers make money by selling photos.  Publishers buy the photos and then make money by selling them and creating media buzz.  The media buzz helps publishers, studios etc. make money from whatever the celebrity is promoting (music, movies, etc.).  Studio houses or whatever pay people very well (as well as contractually obligate them) to to be photographed in order to promote their projects, and the cycle continues.\n\nSimply put, a lot of 'paparazzi' are indirectly employees of production houses who have a vested interest in keeping a person famous.  While there are people thrust into the spotlight who don't like to have their privacy violated, they're an absolute necessity for a lot of celebrities in order to maintain their status which ultimately makes someone else a lot of money because of that status.  Public relations reps often have a cozy relationship with photographers and will 'leak' the wheres and whens of their clients to them in order to keep the celebrity-cycle-of-life (and the money) flowing.\n\nSo in answer to your question, they don't always make a living from ruining people's days, they're often the only reason the person has any sort of income at all.  They know it, the actor/singer/Kardashian knows it, it's understood.  Where do you think someone like Kim Kardashian would be without them?  Answer: she'd be living off mommy &amp; daddies money.   Add 'paparazzi' and suddenly she makes $15mil/year."},
{"title":"ELI5:  The German tax system that goes directly into churches","question_detail":"...and why such a system was created in the first place.  Actually, I'm more interested in the why than the how.  ","answer":"I'm quoting from this Wikipedia article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_tax\n\n&gt; The church tax is only paid by members of the respective church. People who are not members of a church tax-collecting denomination do not have to pay it. Members of a religious community under public law may formally declare their wish to leave the community to state (not religious) authorities. With such a declaration, the obligation to pay church taxes ends.\n\nParaphrasing, the \"why\". It looks like in Germany it was always up to the chief of the tribe to collect taxes for the local religion instead of the religion itself to do so. This has been drawn forward into the modern age by having the state do it."},
{"title":"Eli5: why is everyone trying to be the best in things?","question_detail":"I know that not EVERYONE is trying to be the best in things, but most of us do.

The 'best' pretty much means the majority of people agreeing on something being superior and its evolutionarily positive to not be on the bottom of the social hierarchy."},
{"title":"Why is economics not considered a hard science?","question_detail":"I would love an explanation that compares, and contrasts, economics to widely accepted hard sciences and explains how economics falls short.","answer":"Well by very definition it is a social science. But more fundamentally...\n\nThe 'scientific method' which characterises' hard sciences is simply impossible in economics, theoretically and practically. Physics, the most directly comparable hard science, is characterised by 'truth' and by hard rules. Economics by its nature studies humans and ultimately human nature is determined by things far beyond our understanding and ability to model mathematically or analytically. We can make a 'best guess' and get close but there is no comprehensive truth in economics. Everything is a heuristic or a rule of thumb rather than an absolute truth.\n\nPractically, its difficult to apply the scientific method of experimentation to economics. Generally, where a physicist can conduct a controlled experiment or a chemist can mix two elements, if I want to test how unemployment affects wages I can't (ethically) run an experiment. What I can do is look at data and try and manipulate it in a way that gives the correct result (and by correct I mean the true result, not necessarily the one I want!) Attempts to run experiments in economics are possible, important but ultimately limited. We sometimes have people play lab games to test the validity of economic theory but we have to be careful that we understand why players are doing what they are. We only observe actions in economics. Not motivations. Particles don't have motivations, but humans do, and what they are will affect how they act under different rules.\n\nOn a slightly more technical level, the 'economic method' is fundamentally different, although this is a highly esoteric point. I'm making it because some people try to associate economics with physics because of the overwhelming use of mathematics. This is wrong, because their use is fundamentally different.\n\nHard sciences use mathematics and statistics to measure and explain natural phenomena. Economists use it to analyse. Its called 'axiomatic mathematics' and what it means is that I start with a set of assumptions (people maximise their happiness, people have a fixed income, there are N goods they can choose from etc) and then I figure out the logical conclusion of those assumptions. That is something economics does all the time which is pretty exclusive and it is because it is seeking to explain something which is practically unexplainable, and so we have to strictly define the circumstances under which our theory will hold. \n\nApologies if this was too long or technical, I'm happy to clarify (or debate) any of it. The tl;dr is that economics is not a hard science because it is explaining something so fundamentally different which requires the methods used to be fundamentally different is superficially similar. Economics will never be a hard science but seeing it as a soft science is also incorrect. Its pretty unique. But I would say that. I'm an economist."},

It's a mechanism put in place to make sure that those performing outstanding work in universities can continue to do so, even if they're dissenting or opposing authority.

{"title":"ELI5: Why, when I try and take a photo of a spinning propellor, do the blades warp and slow down?","question_detail":"I was on a twin engined light aircraft this morning and noticed that the blades of the propellor would either warp, stop or reverse in direction whenever I tried to take a photo. Any explanations?","answer":"&gt;stop or reverse in direction\n\nThe warping was already explained, the other effects are due to *stroboscopic effects*. These happen every time when you view something rotating trough a camera wit a relatively slow frame rate, e.g. a film camera or you compact camera.\n\nTo explain how this works imagine a propeller with 1 blade (or a clock hand). The blade starts at the 12 o'clock position, the camera takes a picture. Then it moves very quickly to the 11 o'clock position (the propeller is fast, the campera has a low frame rate), the camera takes the second picture and so on. The result is are images at 12, 11, 10, ... o'clock and it seems that the propeller turns backwards.\n\nIf the propeller speeds up a little bit it can happen that all the images are taken at 12 o'clock, so the propeller seems to stand still. Or it moves even faster and then the images at 12, 1, 2, 3, ... o'clock give the impression of a slowly moving propeller.\n\nBasically you can say for a propeller with 1 blade, that it seems to stand still if it turns roughly 24 times per second (if the camera takes 24 frames per second). Of course 48, 72, ... (2, 3, ... times 24)  revolutions per second work as well.\n\nTh whole thing works similar with several blades, with the added effect that all the blades look the same, so the speed where the propeller stands still happes also at e.g. 12, 24, ... revolutions per second for a propeller with two blades, and 8, 16, 24, ... revolutions per second for 3 blades.\n\n\n**EDIT:** [link to a similar question/answer](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/15pbcl/when_a_car_wheel_is_moving_forward_really_fast/)"},

Even if Boehner could have made a deal, it is unlikely his own party would have supported him.\n\nSo now the best strategy appears to be to reach a deal in the Senate, and hope the House will go along with it...which is a long shot.\n\nAlso, both parties have a political interesting in giving the appearance they are trying to negotiate, so they can try to avoid blame when no deal is reached.

{"title":"ELIF Why does my download speed worsen as soon as the download approaches being complete?","answer":"If you're downloading via BitTorrent then it's because Torrent files are shared by several people, hundreds, sometimes thousands and they are sending these files to you in small pieces, like little bits of lego that will eventually build a wall. So for example, you are downloading a file (the wall) that 1000 people are sharing with you but not all of these 1000 people have the complete file (they don't have all of the lego blocks) downloaded and lets say 800 of these 1000 people have downloaded 80% of these pieces of lego, meaning that when you get past 80% you will have 200 people sharing lego blocks with you instead of 1000, thus making the sharing slower."},

Is it even possible to shut down the actual reaction? or do they just put it on simmer (so to speak) and board up the facility so no one hurts themselves?","answer":"You can shut down the nuclear reaction by inserting control rods or injecting neutron absorbers into the core. \n\nThis only stops the fission reaction. The reactor keeps generating heat due to the nuclear waste products decaying. The reactor needs cooling virtually indefinitely because of this. Even when shut down, the core needs cooling, albeit MUCH less than when the core is critical and at power conditions. \n\nFYI, reactor scrams take about 3 seconds, and will occur automatically after detection of any core parameter outside of its normal operating ranges.

For example, there might be a universe where the force of gravity falls off with the square of distance instead of the cube. Or, there might be a universe where the strong force is 100 times weaker than it is in our universe.\n\nSo, the fundamental properties of our universe become the random chance of what happened to come up in our pocket of existence."},
{"title":"ELI5: Why technology rapidly increased in the 20th century","answer":"The dawn of computing began it. Ever heard of Moore's law? It states that every two years, computing power approximately *doubles.* I'll give you the shorter and a very simple answer. \n\nImagine a computer with a chip design program on it. This is a powerful computer, that chipset engineers will use to design a more powerful processor. Rather, say there are 3 levels of computers. 1 , 2 and 3, with 1 being the least and 3 the most powerful. A chipset engineer sits behind computer 3, and designs a new chip 1, *just as powerful as the preceding chip 2.* In fact, an engineer could sit behind computer 3, and develop a chip more powerful than it using a form CAD, or computer aided design.\n\n***TL; DR: Computers were invented in the early-mid 20th century. in the mid-late 20th century, engineers used computers to design more powerful computers.

In a naive way was hoping for a mindblownesque borderline *10* *Guy* PhD in Quantum Physics answer; however, it looks like the speed of light shows up in E=mc^2 because the speed of light already appeared in other equations that E=mc^2 had to sync with.  These constants show up in  bunch of places because it would be stranger if they didn't (the mind infers patterns when it's really not such a big deal) and in a lot of cases a later equation needs to be somehow related to earlier equations so the thingys (variables?) such as mathematical constants in the earlier equations pop up in a lot of places.  As for why it's the speed of light *squared*, it's science so fuck you that's why.","answer":"So, none of the answers are actually that useful here.\n\nTo greatly simplify, Einstein's Theory of Relativity has several consequences, one of which is that the speed of light is very special. Einstein came up with his theory by saying that electromagnetic waves (which travel at the speed of light) must obey the Maxwell Equations (rules describing how electromagnetic waves behave) for every person measuring them, no matter how fast that person is going. The same goes for forces like gravity.\n\nThe \"relativity\" in the theory's name comes from the fact that everything is measured \"relative\" to how fast the observer is moving, and the speed of light acts as an ultimate speed limit for everything in the universe.\n\nIn order to preserve those rules, the way we originally thought of \"Total Energy\" before relativity had to be changed. In order to make sure that the rules always worked, the total energy term was re-written, and because the Relativity equations had the speed of light in them, the speed of light would also appear in other equations too, including the one for energy."},

Most places in the US now have plumbing code (laws on how to build homes bldgs etc..) that require that all showers be made with a valve that automatically compensates for the drop in cold water pressure that happens when you flush.   In the homes where these valves are installed, when the cold water pressure drops, the valve automatically drops the amount of hot water going into the shower (or faucet in a sink or tub) so that the ratio of hot water to cold water remains the same.   In some valves there is a safety feature that actually shuts the hot water off if the outflow stream gets hot enough to scald. "},

{"title":"What makes the color of water in our cups colorless, but in a lake or ocean seem blue?","answer":"Depth. Water is not perfectly clear. As light passes through water, some of it will be absorbed. Light on the red end of the spectrum tends to get absorbed first, and light on the blue end tends to get absorbed last. The deeper the water, the more blue it will look.\n\nThe exact color you see can also be affected by available light, reflection of the sky (sunny day vs cloudy day), and stuff in the water such as dirt and sea life (such as plankton). That's why lakes and seas can appear anywhere from light blue to dark blue to green."},

{"title":"ELI5: The relationship between decimals and percentages","question_detail":"Heyo ELI5, I'm tutoring a middle school student taking 6th grade math (US public school system) and I was trying to explain the relationship between decimals, fractions and percentages. (E.g. 1 = 1/1 = 100% and 0.5 = 1/2 = 50%, etc) I told her the relationship is like saying you have 100% of something when you have 1 of it, and 150% of something when you have 1 and a half of it, and taught her how to convert between decimals and percentages. (Multiply decimals by 100 to get percentages, divide percentages by 100 to get decimals, or move the decimal point right two places to get percentages and left two places to get decimals)\n\nI feel I could explain how decimals and percentages work better, rather than saying \"100% = 1, just move the decimal to the left two places and you'll be golden\" because it lacks a concrete explanation. I don't remember when I started taking the relationship for granted, it just is what it is, like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Can you guys help me come up with a better explanation?\n\nEdit: I'm going to mark this thread as answered, the example I'm sticking with is the one involving money. Thanks for your responses!","answer":"\nThe two are intimately related. \n\n100% means \"one hundred equally divided parts out of one hundred total parts possible\" (i.e.- all of the parts possible.  Like when you get 100 points out of 100 points on a test). Whereas 32% means \"thirty-two equally divided parts out of one hundred possible parts\" (like when you get 32 out of 100 points on a test).\n\nExample: Let's say I'm running and I have to run past 100 people standing should-to-shoulder to get to the finish line in a race. If I pass 40 of them, then I am 40% completed with my running. If I pass 99 people, then I'm 99% complete with running. If I pass 15 people, and then not quite past the 16th person, then I need to divide that last person into some equal slices to see how far past that person I went.\n\nDecimals rules are fairly straightforward, since each decimal place is just dividing by 10 again:\n\n.8 is just 8/10\n\n.66 is just 66/100\n\n.14159256 is just 14,159,256/100,000,000\n\nthat just means that if you've got to go 100,000,000 miles, then you've gone 14,159,256 miles (part of the way to mars maybe?).\n\nThe changing of a fraction to a decimal is just a question of \"what would I have to multiply this by in order to get a power of 10 on the bottom?\" \n\nIn the case of 1/2 it's 5; in the case of 3/5 it's 2 (since 5*2 is 10). Since you have to multiply the top part as well, then that's doubled. So 1/2 = 5/10 and 3/5 = 6/10; then it's easy to see that 3/5 = .6 and 1/2 = .5. \"Percent\" can also be taken to mean \"multiply the decimal by 100 and at the % sign\".\n\nFractions are little more than the most natural way to tell how far we are from being done with stuff, and percentages are just a \"standardized fraction\" that everybody uses.\n\npercents if you recall were simply nothing more than a simplified version of fractions. Instead of some random number on the bottom, you can take it to the bank that 87 % means that- if you subdivided the distance to your goal into 100 equally sized pieces, you'd have passed 87 little pieces of them to get there, and representing this by a decimal is simply dividing the % number by 100.\n"},

The load (the cell phone battery charging circuit) will only draw as much as it needs and no more.   \n   \nProviding a charging voltage that is significantly over or under spec can sometimes cause a problem, but it depends on the charging circuit.    \n  \nYour 5.3V is close enough.

{"title":"ELI5: Why do beverages have a different taste in different containers (i.e. glass, plastic, aluminum)?","question_detail":"Bottled water just tastes awful to me compared with water from the tap poured into a glass. I guess that could be explained because the water from my tap is not the same as the water in bottles (probably from a different tap). Why do a lot of people feel that the taste of Coke in bottles is superior to the taste in bottles/cans even though they have the same ingredients? Do containers absorb parts of the liquid in different ways?","answer":"The water itself could actually taste different. Bottled water is often just tap water, but tap water from different facilities can taste different depending on how it's treated and what minerals are dissolved in it.\n\nBut the containers can affect taste in a couple different ways. The first and most obvious way is that you might be tasting the container. To test this, clean an aluminum can, a plastic bottle, and a glass bottle very well, and then drink tap water from them. Glass shouldn't taste like anything, and plastic and aluminum shouldn't taste like anything either, but it's worth trying.\n\nNote that the container absorbing the beverage doesn't concern you. Parts of the container dissolving into the drink is what would change taste, apart from tasting the container directly.\n\nWhat can really make a big difference is the shape of the glass. You see this especially with glasses designed for alcoholic drinks. The most important part of \"taste\" is actually your sense of smell, and the shape of the container (especially the opening) can affect the way you smell a beverage."},

Now, work is energy, and a single human can exert a decent amount of energy.  We are at least capable of burning 2500 calories of energy a day, and that doesn't include strenuous exercise.  However, humans can't exert all that much force.  A strong human is more forceful than a weaker one, but it still isn't all that much.\n\nIf someone wanted to dead-lift a 2 tonne cannon up a 100 ft cliff, it would require a lot of force, more than a human can exert.  To to decrease the force, we increase the distance, as the formula shows us.  By using a block and tackle, you are essentially increasing the distance that you pull.  A single pulley would double the distance (100ft to 200ft), which would then cut the force in half.  By putting many pulleys, you can increase the distance so much that the force becomes tiny.  It's the same basic idea if you wanted to climb the cliff. If you wanted to scale the cliff vertically, it would require a lot of force.  However, if you took the long winding path the circles up the mountain, very little force is required, because the distance is greater.\n\nTL/DR:  By increase the amount of distance over which you exert energy, the amount of force decreases."},

Is there anything physically different in one that would make one cost more(I.e different materials) or is the difference in price just something that manufactures make up.\nSame question for processors, RAM, and motherboards. \n\nThanks ","answer":"This question is difficult to answer well in the general case, so I'll address your specific case of the HDD. Physically, there are several things that are different. The read and write heads must be able to work on much smaller areas of magnetism (or the drive needs to have more platters, but I'll ignore that possibility). The controller chips are probably going to have to be improved so that they can read smaller signals and follow narrower tracks on the disc.  The firmware inside the drive would similarly probably have to be upgraded to have more error detection/correction, better facilities for removing bad sectors, etc.   And of course it costs some money to update the marketing collateral that goes along with introducing any new product.  \n  \nAs others have mentioned, the 2TB drive is also going to have worse manufacturing yields than the 60GB drive (in general). So even if they cost the same to make each unit (they don't), a bunch of the 2TB drives would have to be thrown out after testing, making the effective price of the passing ones higher.  (Or you could take the drives that don't have enough good sectors to be a good 2TB drive and call them 1.5TB drives and sell them for less money.)  \n  \nThose are some of the things that make the manufacturer's *cost* of the product greater.  But there's also something important that makes the price you see higher...the *value* of the product.  If a 60GB drive cost the same as a 2TB drive, who would want the 60GB drive?  Either the price for the 2TB drive should be raised, or the price of the 60GB drive should be dropped. "},

I wanted to ask you guys because I imagine you can put it into very basic words. Thank you!","answer":"The NASDAQ and DOW numbers in financial reports are *indexes* (or indices if you wish). Essentially, they are bundles of stocks that are meant to represent the general direction of the stock market. \n\nAny one company's stock may go up or down for any number of reasons. For example, Apple's stock may go up because a new iPhone came out, even if the rest of the market is going down. By grouping lots of stocks together, on average you can see how the stock market is doing.\n\nThe DOW (or Dow Jones Industrial Average) is an index of the so-called 'blue chips', or some of the biggest companies in the US. Some current members are 3M, Boeing, IBM, and McDonald's (and [26 others](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average#Components)). Most of the stocks in the DJIA are traded at the New York Stock Exchange, which is a physical building on Wall Street in New York City (this is why sometimes big business is simply referred to as 'Wall Street'). \n\nGetting a little more complicated, the NASDAQ is an internet-based stock exchange. Rather than being based in a physical location, all of the trading is done online. Since the NASDAQ is a much more tech-savy exchange, many of the companies on it are high-tech firms.  The number quoted on the news is actually the NASDAQ-100, an index of the 100 largest non-bank companies on the NASDAQ exchange.

Any searches I do online are just above my head as far as the scientific jargon, and with this \"largest known structure in the universe discovered\" business, I'd like to understand what exactly the deal is.","answer":"A quasar is a \"quasi-stellar object.\" It looks like a star at first glance, but then astronomers realized they were much farther away than normal stars. In order to still seem as bright as a star at that incredible distance, this meant that the quasar had to be REALLY bright, as in much brighter than a galaxy, even though a galaxy is already made of billions of stars as bright or brighter than our own sun. Since quasars are so far away, we can't examine them very thoroughly, and can only form theories about what they are. The black hole idea Mr. Rowaway has set forth is considered the most likely explanation. \n\nThe farther away something is, the longer its light has taken to reach us, which means we are seeing that thing as it was long ago. As some of the farthest things we can see, quasars must also therefore be some of the earliest things to have formed in the universe when it was young. That's why quasars are important; studying them can tell us more about what was happening in the early universe, and how the universe got to be the way it is now. "},

{"title":"How does a train engine pull so many cars?","question_detail":"I just saw a train today that consisted of 125 cars. Pulled by 3 engines. how do they do this?","answer":"Firstly, frieght locomotives are designed to have an immense amount of tractive effort to get a long train started, for example an ES44AC can produce up to 80 TONNES of force at zero speed. Since the wagons of a train have far less friction compared to rubber tires on a road, once the train has started to move, it's going to keep going without needing much force to keep it at the same speed. But since a freight train of 125 cars may be around 10,000 tonnes, so freight locomotives are equipped with giant diesel engines, up to around 6000HP, enough to accelerate a huge amount weight to a decent speed (in the US freights usually run at around 30-50MPH for efficiency). \n\nAlso if one locomotive is not enough, multiple locomotives can be connected together for even more pulling power, and for the very longest trains, there will often be extra locomotives inserted in the middle of the train or at the end, operated by remote control for even more pulling power."},
{"title":"What are the different types of equity in a startup?","question_detail":"I have a startup.  Currently we are 2 people and we plan to split things 65/35.  \n\nWe have found a developer to make our product.  We're paying them cash for the initial build, which will get us to launch.  Once we launch, we will need help in terms of support, maintenance and adding new features.  The developer is open to taking equity in exchange for this longer term relationship.  \n\nI understand there are several types of equity/stock.  I've done google searches and looked on quora but its difficult for me to understand.  I come from a creative background so don't know much about finance/business stuff.\n\nCan someone please explain to me what our options are as far as offering the developer equity, and what it means further down the line (if we go towards securing bigger amounts of funding from a VC, etc)?  I am hearing terms like common stock, preferred stock, dilution, convertible notes and I'm having trouble understanding.  \n\nEventually we'll hire a lawyer to draft the terms, etc but we need to be able to understand this enough to have an intelligent conversation with the developer and come to an agreement, before we go to the lawyer to have the paperwork done.  \n","answer":"You really should talk to a lawyer about the best option for your situation.\n\nThat said...\n\nCommon stock are regular old shares in the company. They get voting rights etc. Preferred stock is still an ownership stake but they don't get voting rights - but in exchange for this loss of rights, if the company goes under, they get paid out before common stocks when all the assets get sold off.\n\nDilution means making a stock equal to a smaller share of the company than it was before. I'm not totally clear on the technical aspect of it, but it essentially means that if your 1 share of the company was worth 1% today, if it was diluted by the company issuing more shares, your stock might 'own' a smaller part of the company.\n\nConvertible notes and options variously give the holder the right to get stock in the company at a specific price, but they don't need to take them if they don't want to.\n\nBasically what it comes down to is you don't want to give away all your equity to just anybody because that's something you can use to secure funding from venture capitalists. Once you give something away, it's really hard to get it back. Obviously you want to pay the guy who's working for you, but make sure you know what you're getting in to.\n"},

It's not just heating it that sets it, but putting it in a desired shape when it is hot and having it cool down some while in that shape.  Curling irons work best if you quickly roll the hair back up and pin it while it is still how and leave it until it cools. That's also why many hairdryers have cool buttons."},

Only thing, i have got no idea what its about, other then being a error checking solution at the data link layer of the OSI model. So someone, please explain it to me as if I was 5. \n*Just fyi I've read my book, wikipedia, wolfram and nada understanding.* ","answer":"Here's the very basic explanation of a CRC:\n\nWhen transmitting data across a network, you run the risk of losing some of that data to transmission noise. This was especially prevalent in older systems (think audio modems with noisy phone lines).\n\nIn order to prevent this you need a way to allow the receiver of the data to check the data is good. Sending it more than once is obviously inefficient and impractical, so another method was devised- the CRC.\n\nThis is an extremely simplified explanation, by the way. Using a CRC, the sender takes the message and for each chunk of the message it computes a value based on the data in the message. The resulting value is called a \"checksum\". It is then added to the message data and sent.\n\nThe receiver of the message takes the data blocks and computes the same value for each one. Then it compares the checksum to the one the sender provided. If they do not match, the receiver can assume the message was damaged in transit and can request the data block again.\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: What is computer programming, what do the codes do, and why do the codes work?","answer":"Computers can do simple operations and only simple operations, like reading in a number, saving a number somewhere, adding numbers together and so on. To get a computer to do something as simple as adding two numbers together, it has to read the first, read the second, carry out the operation and save the result. \n\nEach operation is so simple that getting a computer to do anything interesting requires millions to billions of them, executed one after the other. This set of operations or \"instructions\" is your \"program\". To make things more confusing, the computer only deals with 1s and 0s (binary), so the instructions have to be put in as numbers. It's quite easy to make a chip that will turn easy-to-read numbers into binary and binary into easy-to-read numbers, so at least the programmer isn't sitting there pushing a button to enter 0 and another button to enter 1, but it still isn't easy to tell the computer what to do that way.\n\nAs computers were able to do more and more, people realized that putting in these instructions manually was getting too difficult, so they wrote a program called an \"assembler\". The assembler would read text that looked sort of like English, where each instruction has a name (rather than a number) and the different parts of the CPU have names (rather than numbers), and turn those into instructions that the CPU could understand. This \"assembly\" language made creating programs easier. For the most part though, one assembly instruction would translate into one CPU (binary) instruction.\n\nNext, it was decided to make languages in which one command would translate into more than one assembly instruction. That means you write \"x = a + b\" and that gets translated (or \"compiled\") into ALL of the assembly instructions needed. The assembly instructions are then translated into the binary instructions that your CPU understands.\n\nWhen people say \"source code\", they usually mean writing something in these last languages, which include C and C++. In essence, the source code is some text that, in a process that takes several steps (e.g. C --&gt; assembly --&gt; binary), is converted into 1s and 0s that the computer understands.\n\n\"Programming\" is writing the source code.\n\nThe \"codes\" are converted into a series of instructions the computer understands.\n\nHopefully, the body of this reply explained why they work well enough. I don't really know of a simple way to explain how a CPU works, which would truly explain how this all comes together."},
{"title":"What are the differences between ADHD and anxiety? ","question_detail":"They both seem similar to me, in that they both prevent normal cognition by overloading you with information.","answer":"They can manifest with similar symptoms, and both can inform the other, but they are separate issues. Anxiety is created by stresses, internal or external, and is a sort of fear or worry; a sense of dread, sometimes about specific things or sometimes about life in general. Anxiety is what you might feel when you're about to give a speech before a crowd, or when you walk down a dark alleyway at 3AM and a group starts following you. A person with an anxiety disorder might feel this way all the time for no reason at all.\n\nADHD is a disorder in the ability to direct and control mental focus. A healthy brain will automatically filter its experiences according to importance -- if you are reading a book, then a pigeon cooing in the background is unimportant, and you 'filter it out'. A gunshot going off, that's important, that will grab all of your attention instantly. If something reminds you of the dog you had as a child, that crosses your mind briefly, but you decide to ignore it and get back to reading. \n\nIn an ADHD brain, that doesn't happen; the filter is weak or absent. The book you are reading is equally as important as the pigeon cooing; your attention will be divided equally among both. If a line in your book reminds you of Jimmy Stewart, you are now thinking equally about a French guy eating a madeleine and Jimmy Stewart's dialogue from Rope. And because the faculties for directing attention are already weakened, it isn't possible to consciously redirect this attention the way a normal person might when studying. Conversely, when a particular subject or idea *is* personally engaging and highly-attention-grabbing, it can be impossible to *stop* thinking about it -- a state called *hyperfocus*. This is why some ADHD patients will display 'savant' or 'stupid genius' behaviour by knocking off War &amp; Peace over a weekend but not being able to follow the plot of CSI.\n\nThere are two predominant subtypes of ADHD. In *Predominantly-Inattentive*, or *ADHD-PI*, the attention-director in your brain says \"Everything is equally important; focus equally on everything.\" Your attention is divided equally among every thought, emotion, sensation and experience occurring at this moment and in your short-term memory, becoming so diffuse that in extreme circumstances you have 'zoned out'. In *Predominantly-Hyperactive*, or *ADHD-PH*, the attention-director says \"Nothing here is really important; go find something important.\" It's the same sensation a normal person would get when sitting in a doctor's waiting room, except it occurs 24/7 regardless of what is happening, resulting in the sufferer bouncing from activity to activity and thought to thought at a manic pace desperately looking for a non-existent stimulus that *will* be ranked as important.\n\nADHD *results in* anxiety for almost all sufferers, because it makes many things, like studying material that isn't personally engaging, virtually impossible, making it difficult to direct or progress one's life, making it hard or impossible to attend schools or take many jobs -- this creates a strong sense of self-hatred among many ADHD patients, and self-harm and suicide rates are high (and for ADHD-PH, drug abuse rates are also very high). The medications that treat ADHD are also generally variations on amphetamines, and one of the primary symptoms of using them is anxiety. "},

The wiggles in the groove make the stylus wiggle, and it is attached to a little magnet inside of a coil(inductor) inside of the cartridge body (for a magnetic cartridge phongraph). The wiggles in the magnet make small changes in electric current flowing through the coil, and those small changes are then amplified. The amplified output goes from the turntable to an audio amplifier which amplifies them further and sends them on to a speaker. The speaker contains a magnet and there's a coil(inductor) attached to the speaker cone.  Changes in the electric current through the coil make it move in the magnetic field, and that motion is passed on to the speaker cone which moves in and out.

{"title":"ELI5: How would low/high house prices affect an economy?","answer":"Well a couple ways. First a house is a good source of 'forced savings', if you have a 300k$ mortgage, as you pay it down, assuming your house maintains its value you can always sell it and get access to that money. Frequently 'downgrading' to a lower value home is a key part of a retirement plan. Obviously if the value of the house goes down this effect is smaller, and larger if the price goes up.\n\nSecond a lot of people are employed by the existence of houses. A large part of the 'small businesses' in the US are small contracting firms which do construction. So when houses are worth less there is less incentive to improve them and this construction workers and contractors get put out of work.\n\nAlso houses are a good source of collateral for entrepreneurs and investors who are looking to grow a business. When houses are worth less it is harder for these people to get access to funds.\n\nI've probably missed some but you get the idea. (Its worth noting that high housing prices aren't universally good, for example it has disproportionately negative effects on low-middle class and lower class citizens)"},

And another person mentioned jimmy carter being a POS in relationship to what he did to Taiwan, so I started researching that and landing on the Taiwan Relations Act and I don't really understand it.","answer":"After WWII, China descended into civil war between the Nationalist government led by Chiang Kai-Shek and the Communists led by Mao Zedong. In the ensuing conflict, the Communists emerged victorious and the Nationalists fled to Taiwan.\n\nBoth governments, to this day, continue to claim to be the sole legal incarnation of China and refused to recognize the other. Under Mao's leadership, China (or the People's Republic of China, PRC) sided with the Soviet Union against the United States and Taiwan (or the Republic of China, ROC). There is some additional complexity here in that the PRC and the Soviet Union turned hostile towards each other around 1960, which made it possible for President Nixon to visit China in 1972, but we can ignore this for now. \n\nAfter Mao's death in 1976, China's new leader, Deng Xiaoping, began a series of reforms to open up China's economy and improve relations with the West. China and the US entered into a \"honeymoon\" period of positive relations, resulting in the US  granting the PRC official recognition in 1979. Some in Congress were unhappy at this move, which was seen as \"abandoning an old friend\", and passed the Taiwan Relations Act, which mandates several important things. \n\n1. The US will stop officially recognizing the ROC, but for all intents and purposes will still treat Taiwan the same as other \"foreign countries, nations, states, governments, or similar entities\". Basically, the non-recognition of the ROC is in name only. However, \"Taiwan\" applies only to Taiwan island and Penghu, not to some disputed territories like the Diaoyu Islands. \n\n2. The US makes clear that it will treat any \"non-peaceful\" attempt (including embargoes and blockades) to determine the future of Taiwan as a cause for serious concern, which, in diplomatic speak, basically means DON'T DO IT...OR ELSE.\n\n3. Most unacceptable to the PRC is that the act mandates arms sales to Taiwan and maintains the capacity of the US to resist any non-peaceful attempt to determine Taiwan's future. \n\nThe act is very careful *not to mandate US involvement* in the case that Taiwan does get attacked, and there is a general view that the US is unlikely to intervene militarily if the PRC does attack Taiwan. But \"is unlikely to\" is not the same as \"won't\". This purposeful ambiguity allows the US flexibility in dealing with the situation while still discouraging hostile PRC action. \n\nThe Taiwan Relations Act is a major thorn in US-China relations, and China protests loudly every time the US sells arms to Taiwan. But over the years there has developed a general understanding that neither the US nor China will make any sudden moves to change the status quo. The US has refrained from selling some of the more advanced equipment to Taiwan, and China has shortened the period of its theatrical outrage from months, to weeks, and recently to days. Relations between the two countries is simply too complex and multi-faceted to be dominated by the Taiwan issue alone. "},

So, keeping an innocent person locked up is against the ideals we strive for. But, you have to balance that freedom versus the chance that someone will run away before the trial is finished. So, what you do is require them to put up a large sum of money that will hopefully keep them from running away.

{"title":"ELI5:  Stradivari violins and why they are better than others","answer":"I read about this a very long time ago, but what I recall is:\n\nAs I recall, it was a *dentist,* of all people, who also happened to be an avid violinist and self-taught luthier, who managed to get ahold of some Stradivari fragments (as some of the violins have been destroyed over the years) and studied them under a microscope. What he found was that the tiny pores in the wood were first of all completely open (instead of plugged, partially or completely) and second of all that they contained countless microscopic grains of metallic salts. He surmised that when instruments made from this wood were played, they would resonate with millions of harmonic elements through the open channels, making the sound more vibrant.\n\nHe eventually determined that Stradiviari himself likely had no idea about this, or any special technique, but rather just happened to soak his starting wood pieces in water that was high in metallic salts.\n\nThe article I read (again, this was many years ago) went on to say that he duplicated the process, intentionally soaking wood parts in water he'd impregnated with metallic salts, and from that built a new violin that sounded extraordinarily fine.\n"},

They all have avatars representing the players, maps to move around in, weapons to shoot people with and stuff to figure out who hits who.  If you had some programs (the *engine*) to take care of all that then you could make a range of games that use the same mechanics but have different appearances.  \nYou could make one game that has avatars looking like medieval guys, maps that look like forests and bows to shoot with.

{"title":"What in gods name is the RAS cell in genetics","question_detail":"I am a little confused in my genetics class I don't know what RAS is, it's some sort of cell or gene, but I don't really understand.\n\nEDIT: Answered","answer":"Ras is a family of proteins that are responsible for sending signals within cells.  So for example, some molecule would bind to a receptor on the surface of a cell. That receptor would then undergo some sort of change, which sets off a chain reaction of activation.  One of these so called \"second messengers\" that gets activated is part of the Ras family.  Specifically, Ras proteins promote cell growth and proliferation.  For this reason, the ras gene, which encodes the Ras proteins, is known as a proto-oncogene.  A mutation in the ras gene would lead to constant Ras activation, which would lead to uncontrolled cell growth, aka cancer."},

{"title":"ELI5 how does the average wage of a country increase?","question_detail":"Well, the concept is clearer when we're talking about, for example, a company that offers a certain type of a product. When people really get into that product and more of them start buying it, the incomes of the company increase and they can offer bigger salaries since they're making more money.\n\nBut it gets hazy when I take it to a state level. Basically, if I understand this correctly, you can pay more money if you have more money and the private sector gets the majority of its money from contracts and deals and the public sector from collecting taxes. Both of these forms of generating revenue expect wasting money (private enterprises cannot get more money without anyone giving them and the more people spend, the more tax money the state collects). If wasting money is the prerequisite of gaining money, I end up in a circular logic that doesn't get me anywhere, there has to be someone/something to initiate this growth of spending. Does it all come down to foreign and international contracts? What about the questions of supply and demand?\n\n\nI may have got this all wrong, feel free to critically judge my thinking and give me a correct explanation.","answer":"Generally, and this is basically Economics 101, wages tend to be related to the productivity of workers. This relationship has been shown to exist in the past few decades, although in some countries (like the U.S.) this has stagnated in recent years. \n\nThe economic logic behind this is that if wages were lower than productivity per worker (or the value that a worker creates), companies would have an incentive to hire more workers, which has an upward pressure on wages (increased demand for labour) and downward pressure on productivity (due to diminishing returns). The other way around, if wages were higher than productivity, companies will have incentives to decrease the labour force, which creates a downward pressure and wages and an upward pressure on productivity. \n\nIn a competitive environment, companies compete with each other on things like efficiency, productivity, innovation, etc. Capital investments which lead to more efficient machines for producing goods will lead to higher productivity. Also, companies will benefit from a highly educated labour force, which in turn is more productive. All these factors lead to higher wages. \n\nMy country (the Netherlands) is a good example of a modern Western nation that invests a lot in infrastructure, healthcare and education. This means our labour force is happy, healthy, can get from A to B efficiently and is highly educated. Because of this, our labour force is one of the most productive in the world. Companies want to settle here because of the abundance of labour, hence the high Foreign Direct Investment.\n\nA leading example of this might be ASML. While a lot of high-tech companies (making hardware, that is) are located in east-asia because of cheap labour, ASML (the world's leading company in producing lithography machines used for chip-making) is located in the Netherlands. Is was formed as a joint venture between ASM and Philips and is strategically located near the technical university of Eindhoven. ASML employs thousands of highly educated engineers and researches to make the worlds best lithography machines (machines selling for tens of millions of euro's), something which might me a lot more difficult in East-Asia because the amount of highly skilled employees would be harder to find. Obviously, these employees are scarce and therefore make very good wages. "},

The best idea people have has to do with your brain and nerves. You have nerves that connect your eyes to your brain, and your nose to your brain.

So, sometimes, when you look at a bright light, your eyes tell your brain there's something going on, but your brain gets mixed up and things there's something happening in your nose. Then, your brain decides that the best way to protect your nose is to make you sneeze, to get rid of anything in your nose that might not belong there.

{"title":"ELI5: How did the American accent come about if the colonists came from either England or non-English speaking countries?","answer":"Colonial accents tend to take after the accent of the European country at the time of colonization. As mentioned elsewhere, American English, in particular New Englander's accents, are closer to 16th century Elizabethan accents of England. I've heard the Appalachian accents are even closer to the English accents at the time of immigration (many of them are Scotch-Irish decent, second half of 18th century). Even an earlier type of English with an archaic accent would be Newfoundland English. If you ever hear someone's accent from Newfoundland, it's descended from the Anglo-Irish spoken in the *15th century* and almost a middle age English accent (it sounds REALLY odd to Americans and we mistake it for modern Irish accents)!\n\nAustralian/New Zealand accent's sound closer to British accents to us because they actually are closer. They were colonized later than the Americas and reflect the British accent of the time,which is closer to the modern accent than ours. \n\nNote it is not just English, but other European languages in the New World and elsewhere take after this. Ask any Latin American and they will tell you Spanish spoken in Spain sounds funny to them. Likewise Brazilians saying the same of Portugal.  \n\nModern French will make fun of Quebecker French because that accent is based off farmers in rural 18th century France who immigrated to Quebec.

{"title":"ELI5: How video games started?","question_detail":"How did video games actually start? and progress to the point they are at now, play they quite a lot but don't really know anything about the history of them. \nThanks in advance.","answer":"Here's a brief history from a perspective of 90's PC gamer. My knowledge is full of holes, but should give you some perspective. For a better idea, check links below the wall of text.\n\nFirst \"video game\" was called \"Cathode ray tube amusement device\" and it's from 1947. You job was to position a dot over an airplane and press a button. After that there were simple chess and NIM and tic-tac-toe and whatnot.\n\nHowever, one of the earliest, most popular games was Pong (1972). You bounced a dot towards your opponent and he had to bounce it back or lose a point. Kind of like table tennis, only simpler. \n\nJumping a couple of years there was Pacman, Space Invaders, Asteroids and probably few other classics I can't remember. \n\nIn 1980s genres emerged. There were text-based adventure games (basically a choose-your-own adventure book), first Zelda, first platformers (Prince of Persia being one of the still playable ones), first text-based RPGs.\n\n1990 were the golden era of adventure games, with Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle, Gabriel Knight and many other classics you should play. The last great adventure game was Grim Fandango and it's a must-play for any fan of noir movies and videogames. \n\nAs technology progressed and CD happened, there was more available space than graphics of the time could take up, so there was also a sub-genre called \"interactive movies\" or FMVs. These were usually adventure games (also some more arcadey stuff, like Mortal Kombat). These consisted of a filmed footage and clickable elements. It was cool at the time, but ultimately crappy acting, low budgets and generally non-flexible medium lead to their extinction.\n\nThere were also many platformers, and RTS games, but what's the most important achievement of that era was Wolfenstein 3D and more important the Doom series. These were the first FPS games that people played and are now considered classics.\n\nIn 1996 Quake 1 happened which was the first FPS game in true 3D. Every object was 3D and little to no tricks with sprites were used. It was simplistic exploration/kill everything game, but it was rather damn great. \n\nEngine of that game was a basis of first Half-Life, one of the first FPS games which told the story through its game, rather than a booklet, or a wall of text between stages or a cutscene. Its mod community also spawned the most popular multiplayer FPS of all time - Counter-Strike (and a bit less popular, Team Fortress).\n\nFirst Thief also came out in the 90s. It was responsible for mandatory stealth sections in games not designed for stealth.\n\nSystem Shock introduced telling story through scattered notes and audio logs.\n\nThe 90s also gave us other notable titles, like Blood, Duke Nukem 3D, Warcraft series, Starcraft series (Starcraft 1 is still played today and has widespread following), Command &amp; Conquer, Unreal and Unreal Tournament, Diablo series, Mortal Kombat, Tekken, Legacy of Kain, Heroes of Might and Magic, Worms... \n\n00s gave us Medal of Honour and Call of Duty which started a trend of WWII shooters, and killing Nazis became a cliche as killing zombies is today. These were also one of the first games were there was a limit on how many weapons you could carry IIRC.\n\nFirst Max Payne gave us the bullet time mechanic, which got copied so many times in different games that it also became a cliche.\n\nDoom 3 gave us megatexturing, bump mapping and dynamic lighting, things that helped greatly improving realism of games. When I looked at the screens I was blown away by how realistic these graphics looked.\n\nHalf-Life 2 gave us widespread use of physics in games and procedural facial animation.\n\nOther notable titles include: successful reboot of Prince of Persia games and turning them into trilogy, F.E.A.R, Silent Hill 2 (still playable and still one of the best horror games of all time), World of Warcraft (\"If you see a mountain at the horizon, you can go there and climb it\" as it was advertised), Portal, and some other games that get rather close to 2010, so I won't bother.\n\n---\n\nAnyhow, that's the incomplete, biased and subjective point of view. \n\nFor better understanding check these two wiki pages: [link](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_video_game) and [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_games). \n\nAlso, check out Angry Video Game Nerd videos, as he plays through some of the forgotten and less forgotten titles: [link](http://www.youtube.com/user/JamesNintendoNerd/videos?view=0)\n\nThere is also Yahtzee (zero punctuation fame) and his let's plays, which are quite amusing and a bit informative on how games, especially action-adventure games, were: [link](http://www.youtube.com/user/yahtzee19)\n\nTheSpoonyOne did quite a few reviews of FMVs, so you might check out his website (it's designed a bit like shit, so you might have hard time finding them, but it's worth it). He also did Ultima retrospective, which is one of the best things a young gamer can check out to understand video games evolution: [link](http://spoonyexperiment.com/game-reviews/)\n\nThere are probably better reviewers/let's players of the older titles, but these are the ones I've found the most amusing.

","question_detail":"I'm sure this has something to do with customer tracking, wanting to spam me, etc., but is this really so lucrative that companies tolerate slowing down their lines and pissing off their customers like this? ","answer":"If you are using any credit instrument (including cheques), the merchant may demand reasonable assurance that you are the person entitled to use that instrument, as well as reasonable assurance of protection should the instrument prove false or unworthy. This is to protect the merchant from loss resulting from fraud, misuse, and so on, because the payment method at the point of sale is not self-warranting. (In the manner that, say precious metals are.)\n\nIf you are paying with legal tender (cash), the merchant may *request* personal information, but may not *require* it for purchase. If they have already agreed to the sale and the price, legal tender on its own warrants the satisfaction of debt of purchase. The cash itself may be challenged for validity, but the buyer may not be, as legal tender is self-warranting, being backed by a governing authority. (Note that this is only true within the jurisdiction of that same authority: Canadians will usually accept your U.S. cash, but they don't *have* to. U.S. merchants are free to impose some restrictions, such as refusing to take large bills, but may not be capricious about it -- *i.e.,* it's okay for the guy in front of you, but not you.)\n\nIf you're being pressed for such information duriing a *cash* sale, I think the merchant is likely in violation of law. And I've had those arguements with them myself. But unless they actually refuse, it's hard to press, and not worth it.

{"title":"ELI5: Solar energy. How it works, how it benefits us, and how easy or difficult it would be to implement solar energy usage (especially in Texas)","answer":"Okay, so first *energy.* Energy is, any good scientist will tell you, the *capacity to do work.* There are more rigorous, and much more interesting, ways to define energy, but the short version is that if you want to do anything at all, you're gonna need energy.\n\nSince people are notoriously ambitious and always wanna do stuff, we need a lot of energy. Which naturally raises two questions: Where does energy *come from,* and how can energy be *stored* so it can be used later?\n\nSolar energy refers specifically to the energy that *comes from* (in reference to that first question) the sun directly. There are two ways to get energy directly from the sun: first, there's the fact that the sun makes things warm (heat is a type of energy), and second there's the fancy-named *photovoltaic effect.*\n\nIf you leave a bowl of water out in the sun for a while until it gets warm, you've just used solar energy. Your goal was to heat the water, and you used the energy that comes directly from the sun to do it, so that's solar energy.\n\nTrouble with that is, the sun doesn't make things *very hot,* generally speaking. It makes things *pleasantly warm,* yeah, but it's not like you're gonna leave a hunk of iron out in the sun until it melts. So to use the heat energy of the sun to do anything particularly interesting, you need to use tricks like focusing large numbers of mirrors on a single spot, taking the all-spread-out sunlight that makes things pleasantly warm and turning into a concentrated solar death ray that can melt lead â¦ or at the very least, boil water, which is a useful thing people do often.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the photovoltaic effect, which is just a fancy way of saying that if you put a *particular type of thing* in the sun, an electric current will flow across it. (Blah blah physics, et cetera.)\n\nBut the photovoltaic effect has the same fundamental flaw as the solar-thermal thing: There's just *not that much sunlight,* comparatively speaking. The number that gets thrown around most often is one kilowatt per square meter: that is, it's possible to extract, in principle, as much as one thousand watts of power from a square meter of Earth's surface under direct sunlight. But that's just a notional figure; a useful average is closer to 800 watts per square meter.\n\nBut remember, that's the *maximum.* In reality, photovoltaic cells are capable of developing closer to 100 watts per square meter. Which is significantly less than is required to run a typical coffee pot.\n\nTo put that into perspective, the state of Texas has been known to consume, on hot days in the summer when lots of power is used for climate control, upwards of *sixty gigawatts* of power. That's 60 billion watts. To provide that much power, Texas would need *two hundred and thirty square miles* of solid photovoltaic cells.\n\nThat's a lot. And it wouldn't be enough anyway, because that many solar cells would only develop that much power under the best possible conditions, which would occur only during the daytime (obviously!) and only a few days out of the year. So realistically, you'd need many times that much to provide enough power to satisfy the state of Texas â¦Â and the power needs of the state of Texas are growing by something like two percent per year.\n\nSo basically, solar power is great because it's free (once you have the panels) and clean â¦Â but there's so little power to be had in sunlight, it's really not worth considering as a *primary* source of energy for our civilization. It's an awesome supplement, in situations where it's available and easy to exploit, but it's not ever going to be something that provides the lion's share of our energy."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why do cables sometimes \"like\" to be tangled up in a certain way?","question_detail":"I know the title is a little hard to understand, but I couldn't think of a short way to put it.\n\nLast night, I had my earbuds in my hands and I noticed that at the part where the wires split into two and branch off to each earbud, the wires were tangled in a way that looked like a double helix - like one wire was going around the other a bunch of times, creating a spiral. I untwisted and straightened them, only to find that they twisted up in the same way after I took my hands off of the wires. I straightened and fixed them again, but they reverted back to their double helix shape again.\n\n\nWhy does this happen? Why do they twist up again after I straighten them?","answer":"Your earbuds are most likely to be metal wires sheathed in plastic. The plastic sheath is not glued to the wire, except at the ends. The plastic is deformable, as well.\n\nSometimes, you straighten your earbuds, right? You lightly grip on end of the wire, and draw the wire through your grip to straighten out the wires so they aren't all tangled. What this does (unintentionally) is deform the plastic, ever so slightly. You can see the same effect amplified if you take an old, broken set of earbuds, grip the wire tightly, and pull it through your grip. You will see the plastic sheath at the end of the wire sort of scrunch up.\n\nMuch like how pushing a string together causes it to bend, deforming the plastic causes it to want to bend. However, the metal wires inside the plastic sheath are still the same shape and length as before. When this happens, both the wire and the sheath are pulling at each other. The result is that the wire and sheath will twist around to relieve some of the tension. This causes the tangle that you see in your earbuds."},

What are the benefits of staying in and how does it help/hurt both economically troubled and sound countries.  Thanks y'all.","answer":"The advantage is that western Europe is widely considered to be what economists called an \"optimal currency area,\" which means it's a place where economic efficiency is a lot higher when there's just one monetary unit in that area.

It's that idea writ large.\n\nThe disadvantages â and there are *many* â all revolve around monetary policy and long-term economic stability. Since the Eurozone does *not* have a completely free flow of labor and capital, it still consists of a number of distinct and effectively separate economies â¦Â but those economies are no longer free to set their own monetary policy.

Saw an article that scientists can look 11 billion light years in the past, but how do they know that the light is that old?","answer":"Measuring sticks and what's called Parallax. \n\nThese can both be expanded on, but I'll give a couple of examples based on it. \n\nOk, so let's say... you've got 2 lightbulbs. One of them is very bright, and the other isn't as bright. They're different distances away and without moving towards them, how do you see which one is closer and which one is farther? (hint, it's what I said at the beginning)\n\nSo what does parallax mean? Well, as the earth goes around the sun, we move a bit in space. It's not terribly long by space's standards, but it does the job well. In the case of our two light bulbs, if you walk side to side (not moving towards or away from the lightbulbs) you should see that, the bright one is much farther away than the dim one and that that even though they looked about the same distance they're definitely not. You can measure in this way and you get degrees of separation of objects. Degrees are often too big for the distance though, minutes (60 minutes to a degree) are also too big. So that's where the second comes in (60 seconds to a minute). I'm sure you've heard of this distance though, because it's a ***Par***alax ***Sec***ond or Parsec. \n\nthe other method, is the measuring stick. In the case of us, we could just grab a tape measure and go to town, but in space we don't have that luxury. (or that much tape. Anywhere.) So we use something we know everything about to get those distances. In the case of extreme distance (like galaxies or quasars) we use what's called a \"standard candle\" a type 1a supernova. Whenever they go off, they're exactly the same brightness, so if it looks brighter or dimmer, we can figure out that \"Oh! It's about that far away!\"\n\nThe other thing is, that there isn't a precise distance in space. If you look at many measurements they're often + or - thousands of units.\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: How does a Glidecam Work?","question_detail":"Like how does it stabilize the shot when you move the camera?  ","answer":"Glidecam is a particular model of a particular type of camera stabilizer, of which there are many. You might be thinking of Steadicam, or any of a dozen other stabilizing rigs, so I'll go into a bit of detail.\n\nA Glidecam is a very simple rig that basically serves one function: make it easier for the camera to be held without wobbling. It operates on the basic precept that the heavier something is, the harder it is to move.\n\nThe constituent parts of your basic Glidecam set-up are as follows.\n\n1. Something to put the camera on.\n2. A stick to put *that* on.\n3. A weight to hang off the bottom of the stick.\n\nThe camera operator will hold this rig in the middle, where the balance lies between the weight of the camera and the weight of the, well, weight.\n\nHolding the camera this way serves a couple of functions. First, it's heavier, so it's less likely to jiggle. If you film something with your iPhone, it's incredibly easy to accidentally wobble the camera in your hands, because it's so light. It puts up virtually no resistance against the twitches of your hands. If you film something with a big heavy camera, it jiggles less, but it's still not perfect. If you film with something *particularly* heavy, like, say, a camera on a Glidecam, the high-frequency jiggle-ry of your muscles gets pretty well smoothed out. \n\nAdditionally, and this is important, having the offset weight on the Glidecam also helps with larger movements. Since the unit is balanced vertically, and you hold it in the center, it wants to \"bounce back\" from any large movement you make, like a pendulum. This makes basic camera moves much smoother. You can swing the camera around, and with some practice, instead of coming to a jerky stop at the end of the move, the camera \"glides\" into place. With some training, you can walk around with a Glidecam and completely offset your every move, so the camera doesn't bounce around at all.\n\nAll in all, a Glidecam functions on some pretty basic physics.\n\nIf you wanna see something amazing, check out a full [Steadicam rig.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=RBj6rTesY2M#t=14s)\n\nThe Steadicam is a big 'ol monstrosity, designed with an intricate series of counterweights and pulleys, that basically allow the cameraman to do *anything at all* and not jiggle the camera. Good Steadicam operators can be at full sprint with their rig, and the shot is as smooth as a baby's bottom. \n\nThe principle of the thing is twofold: one, the operator wears a vest-and-belt style device that is strapped tightly to their bodies. The rest of the rig is connected to this, and all of the weight ends up on the operator's *hips*, not arms. Two, a multi-stage, tension-balanced arm comes around the operator and holds the camera. Each arm segment is connected to the others by hinges, and each arm contains a spring-like system. The springs keep the entire rig under high tension, but every spring is calibrated against every other spring to make the unit tension-neutral. This means that whatever you do with the camera, the rig is pulling against you with equal force. You've basically eliminated the physical ability to screw up.\n\n(This is not entirely true. If you were to put on a Steadicam rig right now, the result would be a mess. Steadicam operators are a talented and well-paid bunch. But the rig is designed such that, with training, it's effectively the *perfect* stabilizer.)\n\nThe coolest thing about the Steadicam is that it's also calibrated against gravity, so if you let go of the camera, it will just float in front of you. The net result is a camera that weighs nothing, yet behaves like it's incredibly heavy.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, that's how it works. One way or another, simply or complexly, a stabilizer rig operates on the idea that resistance to motion is the key to eliminating unwanted motion. Whether it's simply something well-balanced and heavy, or something that costs a hundred grand and looks more like a robot arm, the end result is a jiggle-free shot and a happy director."},

{"title":"ELI5: Entropy","answer":"I realize this has been covered elsewhere but I love this question.\n\nFirst of all, entropy can be defined like this.\nIt is a number that measures the number of ways something can be arranged so that it is basically the same.\n\nTo say that entropy increases is to say that everything tends toward a state which there are many different ways to achieve. Let me make that more clear with an example.\n\nThink about a sand castle. The castle has many many ways that it can be destroyed. You can tip it over in any direction you want. You can tip part of it this way and part of it that way. You can give it a good kick, you can sit on it. Destroying is easy. There is only one way (or at least, less ways if we take a loose definition of what a correctly built sand castle is) for the castle to be put together correctly.\n\nEntropy states that because all configurations (ways to arrange the sand) are equally likely, the states of the castle that can be achieved in the most ways are more likely. Destruction can be achieved in more ways than construction, and so that is what happens over the long term.\n\nTherefore the castle is more likely to be destroyed over time than rebuilt.\nCups are more likely to break over time than reassemble, buildings break down, bodies decay, toothpaste stays outside of the tube (unless you increase an equivalent amount of entropy somewhere else to get it in there) etc etc etc.\n\nHope that helps."},

","answer":"The President appoints people to various positions, including the Labor Relations Board. The Senate has to confirm a lot of those positions. However, the Constitution allows the President to make temporary appointments while the Senate is in recess. The idea here is that if the Secretary of State dies while the Senate is at home the President could pick someone to fill in until the Senate comes back. The appointment runs out at the end of the next session of the Senate.\n\nMany Presidents, including Bush and Obama have used this power to appoint people who they would otherwise have trouble getting approved. So, in order to prevent this, the Senate has in recent years refused to go into recess. They will send a single member into the Senate chamber every 3 days just to bang the gavel and immediately leave. The Senate claims that this means they are still in session and so no recess appointment can be made.\n\nObama claimed that this was a sham and made recess appointments to the Labor Board anyways. The courts recently declared that this appointment was unconstitutional.  The court also went further and said that the only time a President can make recess appointments is in between years and only if the vacancy occurred during the recess. This basically eliminates the recess appointment power of the President."},

You're very sensitive to how hot (like a +) or cold (like a -) it is in the room - you need it to be just right.\n\nFirst, you're too cold. You decide to light a nice warm fire to heat yourself up. What you've done is combined \"more fire\" ( + ) with \"fire is something nice and warm\" (another +). The result? The room gets hotter ( + ). So we see that by combining two + we get another +.\n\nNow, it turns out that the fire has made you too hot, so now you need to cool down. It just so happens that outside the room there are some big blocks of ice. So you decide to drag these blocks of ice into the room. What is the result? We've combined \"more ice\" ( + ) with \"ice is something cold\" ( - ). And due to all this extra ice, the room has gotten colder ( - ). So we see that combining one + with one - gives a -.\n\nUnfortunately, it's still too hot in the room. You decide that the best way to remedy this is by putting out the fire. What is the result? We've combined \"less fire\" ( - ) with \"fire is something warm\" ( + ). And by putting out the fire, we've made the room colder ( - ). So, again, we see that combining one - with one + gives a -.\n\nFinally, with no fire in the room and all this ice sitting around, you end up too cold. So you decide that it would be best if you took all the ice out of the room you are in. What is the result? We've combined \"less ice\" ( - ) with \"ice is something cold\" ( - ). And the result is that when all the ice has gone, the room gets warmer ( + ). So we see that by combining two -, we get a +.\n\ntl;dr - If you make something less (one -) negative (another -), it's the same as making it more (one +) positive (another +).\n\nAny questions?"},

{"title":"Non Newtonian fluid","question_detail":"What is it, why does it act this way, etc.","answer":"The example of non-newtonian fluid that I think is most common is corn starch and water.

{"title":"ELI5: The different books of Christianity and Judaism and their purpose.","answer":"All right, so letâs pretend that religions are people.\n\nA long time ago, there was this odd fellow who wrote lots of books for hundreds of years. He wrote an awful lot of things about how to run a country and he wrote a great story about his family and where he came from. This longâreally, epicâmultivolume story stretched back thousands of years, even in his own time, and it tried to explain where the whole world came from, what God was like, and what people are supposed to be like and how they are supposed to live. The story also tried to explain why Stu ended up where he wasâdown on his luck a bit (at one time, he claims, he was quite wealthy). Weâll call this man Stu (his full name is Second Temple Judaism). His book (really a collection of books) is called the Old Testament by some, and the Tanakh by others, but itâs the same book. \n\nStu had two children. (Well, maybe more, but we donât know much about them.) These two brothers thought Stuâs story was the greatest story ever told. They modeled their lives after his story. But they disagreed over something pretty important. One child, who weâll call Chris (full name: Christianity) thought certain things about a certain person that made his brother Jude (Judaism) uncomfortable. They argued for a while about it, but they didnât really get anywhere. In fact, they only seemed to get madder at each other. It wasnât long before Jude kicked Chris out of the houseâor at least, thatâs the way they tell it where Iâm from.\n\nAfter that, Jude went on to write a lot more books. He wrote the Mishnah to explain how Stuâs family was supposed to live. In this book he answered lots and lots of questions about life that Stuâs book didnât answer. Later on, he added a lot of discussion and commentary to this bookâactually, two different commentaries. These are the Talmudim. He also embellished lots of the stories that Stu told and tried to learn as much from these stories as he could; these books are called Midrashim. More and more and more books followed, and theyâre still being written, because the world changes and Jude still needs to know whether or not itâs okay to ride in a car on Shabbos. (Sometimes he feels like heâs the only one around here who cares about the rules.)\n\nChris went a totally different direction. He wanted to know answers to a different set of questionsâquestions about what God is made of, and how someone can be sure he is going to go somewhere happy after he dies. He was especially interested in one particular manâthe one who started the whole argument with Jude in the first placeâwho seems to have had superpowers, claimed to be God, died, and then come back from the dead and had even more superpowers. He offered his followers immortality. Chris thought this was a lot more important than all of Judeâs stuff, because hey, immortality.\n\nSo Chris wrote the New Testament and packaged it right in with all of Stuâs books and that is what most Christians call the Bible today. Chris went on to write all of the Early Church Fathersâ stuff, and lots and lots of ever-more-specific statements about Godâs nature and other things that most people donât really think about. But it was really really important to Chris that all of this stuff was set down right. Heâs still writing today, too, depending on who you ask. (He had a lot of kids and they tend to argue a bit.)\n\nJude doesnât care much for Chrisâs books, and Chris doesnât care much for Judeâs books. Honestly, they donât even really read each otherâs stuff at all. But they both love Stuâs books and stories, and each brother thinks he is carrying on Stuâs legacy."},

{"title":"ELI5: How is it possible that lawsuits need months / years to finish?","question_detail":"What are they doing all the time? Why are there so long breaks between the court sessions?","answer":"In addition to the two correct answers given, another thing that causes blowouts of timelines in a court case is that you often have a series of smaller fights before the big one.\n\nFor example, lets say you're litigating a patent infringement matter. The owner applicant company hires their lawyers to sue the defendant company. They have to provide their lawyers with lots of complicated information, like when they got the patent, who was involved, what the patent does, what they think the other person was doing, etc. It'll take a few weeks or months for their lawyers to understand where the basis of the case lies and what they're going to sue over.\n\nThen they tell the defendant company that they're suing them, and what for. The defendant company tells their lawyers what's happening, and has to give lots of the same information to their lawyers. \n\nThe defendant might say that they can't be sued - maybe they're in another country and say that the applicant's laws don't apply or that the court the applicant wants to sue in doesn't have jurisdiction to hear the matter. Maybe they say that the applicant didn't sue them properly, because the applicants aren't eligible to sue, or because they didn't use the right forms or actually give them to the defendant in the right way, so they might go to court over that, and the Court will make a decision.\n\nThen the parties go to court again. The owner company wants to get an interlocutary (pre-trial) injunction, which means the defendant company has to stop doing whatever it is they're doing until the Court decides if they're actually infringing the patent. This will be really expensive for the defendant company because they can't do business in the meantime, so they oppose it. The two companies go to court to decide if there should be an interlocutary injunction. The court makes a decision, and maybe one of those companies appeals it to a higher court because the first court made a mistake.\n\nThen you have discovery. When you sue someone or get sued by someone, you can get the court to force them to give you information, like financial records, emails between relevant people, etc. etc. But, in order for that to be fair, you also have to give the other person all of the information they want too. There is often a LOT of information in a discovery, and it takes a long time for the lawyers to read through and organise all of the stuff you get from the opponent or the stuff you're going to give them.\n\nNow, certain types of information may be privileged or confidential, which means it's secret or private and it would be unfair for you to have to give it to your opponent (especially if you compete in the same market). So you might then go to court to argue that you shouldn't have to give the information to them. The Court will make a decision. THAT decision might be appealed to a higher court as well! \n\nDiscovery also takes a long time because after you get some of the opponent's information, you might realise that there's more information that you need based on something you read in what they gave you. So then you have to go to court to get further discovery orders - discovery can go back and forward for years.\n\nThen, after discovery is finally done, the lawyers on both sides have to decide what evidence they want to lead in the trial proper. Each side might argue that the opponent can't use certain evidence because it's prejudicial (e.g. it doesn't actually prove the defendant did what the applicant says, but it makes the defendants look like bad people so the jury/judge is likely to side with the applicant), irrelevant (wasting court time), it's fraudulent, it's an expert opinion who has been corrupted by involvement with the person who's calling them, it's confidential/privileged, etc. Any decision made by the court about some piece of evidence might be appealed to a higher court separately, straight away, before the trial is actually finished (though it is more usual for that to wait for the trial to finish, then appeal it all at once).\n\nFinally, the main trial will finish and the Court makes a decision. That final decision might be appealed on a number of grounds (a mistake by the judge, for example, or a dispute about the amount of damages the loser has to pay), so the whole process goes to a higher court and starts again from the post-discovery phase.\n\nPart of the main decision is often an order about costs. Normally, when one party wins a court case, the court will make the opponent pay for their lawyer's bills and other expenses involved in running the case. However, in a large, complicated trial both sides may win some parts and lose other parts, so costs will be divided between them. For example, if the applicant won on 3 out of 5 of their grounds, but lost the last two, the Court might say that the defendant only has to pay 60% of their costs. \n\nThat decision about costs may itself be appealed to a higher court, starting a whole separate dispute.\n\n\nThe fact that each \"case\" can actually turn into multiple separate trials and decisions can make some complicated cases take for years. In the firm where I work, we have a couple of ongoing cases that are almost 10 years old because of how many appeals and subarguments have had to be faced."},
{"title":"[ELI5] Why do people think cell phones/wifi causes cancer? ","answer":"Sorry for the long post, my ELI5 is near the end. \n\nIt's hard to say where the idea began, but there are a few key themes:\n\n1) Radiation. Everyone talks about how cell phones operate on radio waves and reports of it causing cancer sometimes call it \"radiation\". This is...sort of correct. They *are* electromagnetic radiation, but so are many other things, including radios, satellite signals, and so on. It also ignores the fact that cell phone and wifi waves are too \"large\" to fit between skin cells. \n\n2) Circumstantial evidence and popular \"stories\". These sound like they link cancer to cell phone use, but they are not actual hard evidence and can have many alternate explanations. For example, my mom is a neurologist and had a patient who used to work for CCIS (Canada's secret service). They got a brain tumour exactly around beside device installed in their ear that received radio signals (for covert communication). However, my mother, instead of jumping to the conclusion that it was the signals that caused it, said that it could be anything from mere coincidence since the patient had a family history of brain tumours, to the metals and materials used in the device (this was decades ago, after all). Another example are the many stories of people who \"use their cell phone all the time\" and then get tumours near their ear. Well...yeah. Everyone uses cellphones all the time and, by random chance, a few of them will develop tumours near where they put their cell phone. They confuse circumstantial evidence for actual evidence. *Everyone* does this all the time, usually without even realizing it. I find it takes either university, dedication in high school, or learning from experience to beat it out of them. \n\n3) They don't know what causes cancer. Cancer is caused by cell mutation. However, cell phone signals have not been conclusively proven to cause cell mutation. This is because the strength and frequency of cell phone radiation aren't enough to break down chemical and genetic structures. People who believe they cause cancer either deny or are simply unaware of this fact. \n\n4) There are also a bunch of stuff about how people can be afraid of technology and therefore blame society's ills on technology, which has some merit but probably isn't a root cause. \n\n5) They started believing it and are now in the habit of believing it. My use of \"habit\" is key here. Once someone believes something, it takes a lot of effort and experience for them to believe something else. It is very hard for most people to change their belief in the short term and, the longer they go without questioning something, the less likely it is for them to be convinced otherwise. Many people who started believing cell phones cause cancer back when they were new, mysterious, and relatively unknown things aren't willing to change their opinion.\n\n[Here](http://www.dropeik.com/risk_excerpt.html) is a good article outlining the issue. \n\nELI5: People sometimes believe things because they don't know everything about the topic, which is hardly their fault, or because they refuse to believe facts because they are convinced they are right. They also don't know what is good or bad evidence which, again, is not always their fault. "},

They are ruled by the terrorist group Hamas. \n\nHamas' foundation can be linked directly to Hitler. When Hitler was rising to power but had not yet blatantly stated his goal of wiping the Jews of the planet, he met with a radical Muslim and basically encouraged him to start Hamas. \n\nAnyway, Palestine wants the land because they had it before it was gifted to the Jewish people. The main stream media will tell you this is legitimate, and perhaps it is (the Jews owned the land before the Palestinians, but the Palestinians did fairly win it from the Jews [if you consider war fair]). However you feel about this, that is not the whole story. Hamas' stated goal (it's in their constitution) is to destroy Israel. They  believe Jews are sub-human, descendants of \"apes and pigs\". For years they have bombed Israel. Israel has signed compromise after compromise to give Palestine more land, but the Palestinians wouldn't stop, so the Israelites (and the Palestinians [sort of]) built a big wall in between the nations, and tensions progressively got worse as bombs continued to fall.\n\nThen, as the US's support of Israel waned (the US is pretty much the only reason Israel has avoided a second holocaust), and Iran, an ally of Hamas (not officially, but they are run by people who hate Jews and Westerners [they call the US \"Satan's land\"] like Hamas), were rumored of building nukes, Israel decided to go on the offensive and bomb Palestine. Despite the fact that Hamas has consistently bombed Israel for years, the US media jumped all over Israel. \n\nOne reason for this, is because Israel was bombing at Palestine schools and civility areas. However, they were doing this because Hamas was setting up their \"bombing devices\" in these areas. If Israel didn't shoot at what was shooting them, it would be suicide. This shows how little Hamas actually care about its people. Also, several videos of dead, Palestinian children were leaked to the US media. These videos were proved to be fake (the children were pretending to be dead, or, sadly, the kids were actually killed by rogue Hamas bombs.\n\nEventually, Israel got a big gun that could shoot down any of Palestine's big bombs, so the two sides reached a treaty. However, it won't last long.\n\nMeanwhile, Egypt's dictatorship was recently overthrown. Morsi, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood (and was supported by Obama), won election. He recently passed a constitution basically making him a dictator and taking away a bunch of rights of the people. So the people and the military may over throw him soon. Morsi is also a 9/11 truther, said to be the mastermind behind a failed NJ terrorist attack on a bunch of bridges, and, worst, has called Jews and Americans \"apes and pigs\". He has said he wants to destroy Israel and America. Despite all this, Obama wants him to be the negotiator or middleman in the Israel/Palestine conflict. \n\nWorse yet, in the last week, the Obama admin has given Morsi ~100 of the military jets, as well as ground vehicles. For what? Exactly.\n\nJordan is Israel's only ally in the region, but does not have much influence on anything. \n\nSyria had some sort of rebellion sometime in the last 2 years. The controversy there was that Obama sent troops without the authorization of Congress. \n\nWe're still in Iraq (should have never gone) but are yet to reach an agreement with their government to leave.\n\nNot sure about the others.\n\nAlso, the Benghazi scandal:\ngoogle it\n"},

","question_detail":"Please and thanks!","answer":"Wall Street rises and falls based on corporate profits.\n\nSome things can be good for corporate profits, but bad for most of the economy, or vice versa.  For example, high unemployment can actually be good for corporate profits, since it means that companies can keep wages low and still get the workers they need.  By contrast, when there is very low unemployment, companies have to raise wages to attract workers and that reduces profits.\n\nSome things are good for corporate profits and the economy, or bad for both of them - one example is that low oil prices are good for Wall Street and Main Street, while high oil prices are the reverse."},
{"title":"ELI5:  Why do slick, \"bald\" tires have less traction than tires that are new?","question_detail":"The thing I have trouble with, is that generally more surface area=more traction.  So, if a tire is bald, and has more of a contact patch with the road than if it were independent tread blocks, why am I spinning in 1st gear when my tires are nearly bald, whereas with new tires I can't break traction?\n\nI understand that racing slicks and drag radials are different, they're run at a lower PSI and they flex under torque in addition to having a different rubber compound.  I understand how that works, i'm not asking about racing tires.  Just regular street tires with tread blocks. ","answer":"Tread is mostly there to help with rough, loose, or wet surfaces. On a sunny day with cleanly swept, paved roads, new slicks work fantastically.\n\nThe problem is that modern tires are not just made of rubber. There are dozens of different materials, giving each part of the tire different properties. The tread, the part that is most often in contact with the road, is designed for maximum friction, and as a result, wears down faster. On new slicks, the entire tire is covered in that material.\n\nThe part underneath (which is exposed in the grooves) is designed for durability, so that nothing can puncture it, not for gripping the road. As a result, even though there is more surface area, that area has worse grip."},

{"title":"ELI5 monopoles","answer":"Pole here refers to either a \"positive\" or \"negative\" value of a particular (usually electromagnetic) variable. A monopole is an object that only has one of them. Similarly, a dipole has two (so it will have a positive end and a negative end), a quadrupole has four (like a square with two positive corners diagonally opposite and two negative corners opposite).\n\nFor example, an electron (all negative charge) is an electric monopole. An electric dipole is where you have a negative charge and a positive charge right next to each other.\n\nWith magnets, the positive and negative poles are called north and south. One of the interesting things about magnets is that, as far as we can tell, they're all dipoles; they always have a north and a south end. Even if you cut a magnet in half, instead of getting one north piece and one south piece, you get two little pieces that each have their own north and south piece. We've never found a magnetic monopole, but we think that they are mathematically possible.\n\nIf we could find a magnetic monopole in real life (i.e. a bit that was only north, with no south), it would be very interesting because it would open up a lot of new physics to research."},

They had just lost a war, their economy was in the toilet and the victorious powers were making them pay war reparations.\n\nThe newly formed Weimar Republic were having all sorts of issues dealing with the financial situation.  Their military was also restricted so a lot of young men were released from the army.  They in turn started joining extreme political parties and forming paramilitary groups.  These paramilitary groups then started fighting each other which makes the situation even worse.\n\nHitler and co. come along with their paramilitary group and put forth the myth that it wasn't Germany's fault that they lost the war but the conniving politicians back home who didn't have the will to keep on fighting.   They sold the idea that they could bring stability and prestige back to Germany.\n\nThings for Germany were getting better and better through the years as Hitler gathered more and more power to himself.

{"title":"u/sje46 brings up a good question:\nELI5 how Hitler's ideas were so popular and accepted among the Germans","answer":"The twenties in Germany were a time of outrageous inflation.  Money was basically worthless, and Germany itself was under enormous pressure to pay the fines  the allies gave them after WWI.  There wasn't really an option to pay later either.\nHitler's party started out promoting an idea of a strong Germany and insisting that Germany shouldn't have to pay the fines.  In addition, some land was taken away from Germany after WWI and Hitler's party said it should belong to Germany.\nAs for the Holocaust: the Jews never did have a good reputation in Europe.  They've been subjected to discrimination in pretty much every era and country.  (This is partly due to the Jewish religion allowing  them to act like bankers whereas the Catholic(Christianity in general?) Religion frowns on it.  And everyone knows money can make for bad blood.) While most Germans did not hate the Jews, many were not fond of them.  Finally, the Final Solution (the Holocaust) was not started right away.  The first measures was identification (e.g the stars sewn onto clothing).  Next was isolation, and then the death camps.  A lot of Germans, especially those far away from camps, probably did not know what was going on (or had only heard rumors (which would be hard to believe, I think).\nHitler's ideas became popular because they started out as nationalistic and his government helped pull Germany out of it depression.  As Germany became strong, the idea of Germans being better than everyone else was easy to believe.  In addition, Hitler was very, very good at giving speeches and the higher ups in the Third Reich knew how to manipulate people."},

{"title":"ELI5: why are prime numbers important in cryptography","question_detail":"there are often large awards given for finding new very big prime numbers, and while they dont seem very useful, a lot of sources say they underpin modern cryptography, so whats all that about?\n","answer":"They are important for something called public key cryptography.  The idea is there is one password (called the public key) that lets you encrypt data, and another (called the private key) that lets you decrypt.\n\nThe magic here is that you can give out your public key to the whole world, but it doesn't let them decrypt your messages, and doesn't help them find your private key.\n\nWhat does this have to do with prime numbers?\n\nWell, public key cryptography relies on something called a trapdoor function, a piece of math that is easy to do in one direct, but hard to do in the other.  Multiplying two large prime numbers together is easy for a computer, but taking that number, and finding the two primes that made it, that's really hard.\n\nThe very large prime numbers like the one that was just announced, they are not useful for cryptography for a number of reasons.  They are more about bragging rights."},
{"title":"ELI5: Why are immunities to disease not passed through our parent's genetics?","answer":"Sometimes they are. Depends on what kind of immunity you're talking about.\n\nHere's a great example: You know the Black Death? In the 1300s, an epidemic of the bubonic plague âÂ a really nasty disease âÂ swept through Europe, killing somewhere around *half* of the people who were living there at the time.\n\nSome of the people who were living there survived just out of plain dumb luck; they never contracted the disease. But others contracted it and survived. Some of *those* people, again, survived out of plain dumb luck, but some survived because they had a *mutation* â a genetic peculiarity âÂ that gave them a particular resistance to the disease. This mutation is called CCR5Î32, which I mention only because I don't want to have to type \"that mutation we were talking about\" over and over.\n\nBasically, the way it worked was this: CCR5Î32 was present in the population before the Black Death, just randomly. But not many people had it; way less than one percent. But those people who did have it were naturally resistant to the bubonic plague. So those who had CCR5Î32 and who were exposed to the plague either didn't contract it at all (because CCR5Î32 made them immune) or contracted a less severe case of it that they were able to recover from (because CCR5Î32 made them resistant).\n\nAs a result, today anywhere from 15% to 50% (nobody knows for sure) of people whose ancestors survived the Black Death have CCR5Î32 â¦ compared to less than 1% of the rest of the population of the world.\n\nMeaning if you're a person of European extraction whose ancestors lived there in the 1300s, the odds aren't terrible that you have either a resistance or an outright immunity to the bubonic plague.\n\nAnd here's the neat part: CCR5Î32 is also associated with other disease immunities. People with it are either resistant to or outright immune to both smallpox and HIV. (I say either resistant or immune because a person with CCR5Î32 can either have it once or twice; once means your body produces less CCR5, a protein that those diseases need to spread, and twice means your body doesn't produce it at all.)\n\nIt's not all good news, though. People with CCR5Î32 appear to be *more* susceptible to West Nile virus. So the mutation giveth, and the mutation taketh away.\n\nBut of course, this isn't *really* what you asked. The story of CCR5Î32 is one of natural selection, pure and simple. For ages, there existed this trait in humanity that didn't hurt people but didn't give them any advantage either. Then along came this plague, and by sheer coincidence people with that trait were more likely to survive the plague than people without it. So people without it disproportionately died, and people with it disproportionately survived to have kids and pass that trait on.\n\nSo yes, that's an example (one of a great many) of children inheriting immunity to disease from their parents. But it's not really what you were asking about, because in that case the immunity was *already there,* and it was only passed on because people *without* the immunity died off en masse.\n\nWhat you're asking about âÂ I presume âÂ is *acquired* immunity. Like the fact that once you've had the chicken pox, you are *extremely* unlikely to contract chicken pox again even if exposed to it, because your body has acquired an immunity to it. These kinds of acquired immunities aren't passed on for a simple and obvious reason: They're *acquired.* They weren't in your parent's genes to start with, so your parents couldn't pass them on to you through their genes. You have to acquire your immunity to chicken pox the same way your parents did: By suffering through it once."},

{"title":"Why are some equations,(for example E = MC^2), well, squared?","question_detail":"I know it is sort of a general question, but I would appreciate an answer.","answer":"The *c*Â² in *E* = *mc*Â² comes from the fact that spacetime has the geometry of a hyperbola.\n\nIf I say \"the geometry of a plane,\" you probably know what I'm talking about. I'm talking about plain old ordinary elementary-school geometry, with triangles and stuff. *Plane* geometry, it's called, because it notionally exists in an infinite and perfectly flat plane.\n\nIf I say \"the geometry of a sphere,\" it probably wouldn't be *that* hard for you to figure out what I mean, by analogy with the previous. If the geometry of a plane is geometry that exists in an infinite plane, the geometry of a sphere is geometry that exists within the surface of a sphere. Like the surface of the Earth, for example. The Earth's a sphere (well, close enough), so the geometry of the surface of the Earth is the geometry of a sphere.\n\nThe geometry of a hyperbola, then, is geometry that exists within a hyperbola â¦Â but that's very difficult to visualize, because a hyperbola is, for all intents and purposes, an \"inside-out sphere.\" So while it's trivially easy to imagine the geometry of the plane (just picture it drawn on a piece of paper), and pretty easy to imagine the geometry of the sphere (picture it drawn on a ball), imagining the geometry of a hyperbola is pretty much impossible.\n\nBut we have to cope with it anyway, because *spacetime is hyperbolic.* The fundamental equation of a hyperbola has an *x*Â² â *y*Â² term in it; the coordinates aren't related to each other *directly,* but rather through their *squares.* Because of this relationship, and because spacetime is hyperbolic, *x*Â² â *y*Â²-like terms positively *litter* the mathematics of physics. One place a term like that shows up is in the math you use to convert between two differently moving coordinate systems. A term in that math is *v*Â² â *c*Â², where *c* is the speed of light and *v* is the relative velocity between the two moving coordinate systems.\n\nEinstein figured out that *if* you have to include that *v*Â² â *c*Â² term when you convert between those coordinate systems, *then* it must also be true that the inertial mass of a body is related to its total energy by a factor *c*Â².\n\nIn general, whenever you see a squared term in an equation, you're dealing either with something fundamentally geometric in nature, or you're dealing with some kind of integral. (Or both, in a lot of cases.) In this situation, the squared term comes from the fact that way down under the hood, we're dealing with something fundamentally geometric in nature; that is, the fundamental geometry of the universe."},

{"title":"ELI5 the 10 year t-note, and why it's had to buy bonds right now.","answer":"Let's take some simple numbers for an example, and pretend there's no compounding. Say right now a 10 year bond pays 2%, and a 5 year bond pays 1%. So you buy a 10 year bond for $100, expecting $120 in 10 years.\n\n5 years go by, and interest rates go up. Now a 5 year bond pays 5%, so you think \"That's awesome, I'll just sell this crappy bond and buy a 5 year instead\". The problem is your bond is worth $120 in 5 years. So at todays rates you could only sell it for $96. They won't pay you a dollar more because they could just buy a 5 year bond themselves at the same rate.\n\nBut wait, you paid $100 for it, how can it be worth $96 now? Because as interest rates go up the value of bonds goes down. Sure it's still worth $120 in 5 years, but to get that amount of money you'd only have to put up $96 now. Those last 5 years you held your bond actually cost you $4 over having just put the money in a sock.\n\nIf you had purchased a 5 year bond to start with you'd have $105 after 5 years, and then you could spend that on another 5 year bond at 5% and had $131.25. That's with these made up numbers though.\n\nA lot of people don't factor the opportunity loss into their investment calculations, so they'd just hold the bond for the full period and think they still won. It becomes more apparent when you buy bond funds (bascially a fund that holds a collection of bonds) because they can actually go down if rates go up unexpectedly (if rates are expected to go up that would be factored into the price already).

After driving that car a glorious total of 0.1 miles, that not-technically-new-anymore car may only \"worth\" $18,000 (a loss of ~1/3 the \"value\"), despite having something like 99.99997% of it's life still before it.  Then, at the other end, you've got a car with 200k miles on it, which is only thought to be worth $2,000, despite the fact that it means that you'll be able to save an hour of travel time every day, 5 days a week, for up to 50 weeks a year, for several years before it dies (assuming a median income of roughly $12/hour, that's $3,000 a year, less fuel, insurance, registration, etc)."},
{"title":"ELI5:  Why do we get dizzy when we spin around?  (Actual question by my 5 year old daughter, Kiera)","question_detail":"I don't know how exactly to explain it to her.  I'm pretty sure I know why (ear fluids or whatever) but how do I \"dumb it down\" for her, so to speak.","answer":"Inside your head there's a tiny little balloon filled with water that your brain uses to balance and when we spin around that water starts spinning, just like stirring a pot on the stove, and when we stop spinning the water keeps going just a little bit until it eventually slows down and stops, that's why it's not permanent.  So, for a little while after you stop spinning your brain is getting mixed messages about spinning or not and the end effect is you are dizzy. "},

Bowie's eye color is a very pale blue color.

Does muscle memory overwrite the previous memory?","answer":"[Procedural Memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_memory#Acquisition_of_skill)\n\nEssentially, you've practiced, a lot at these tasks. And as such, your brain has started to identify patterns in the things you do. Like when playing a new chord your brain recognises the instrument it is playing where the keys/chords should be and will adapt its previous pattern to accommodate the new one.\n\nFor example, when playing a video game you haven't played in a while or ever. You pick it up and play it and initially your brain thinks this is a totally new experiance and treats it as such (you don't play well) but soon, your brain starts to see the patterns in the game it already knows (bad guys shoot SHOOT BACK SHOOT BACK) and it just recalls previously learned patterns to help you out. \n\nAny questions, ask away :D"},
{"title":"EILI5:  The tradition and reason behind fighting in hockey","question_detail":"I am trying to be a better hockey fan and want to understand why fights are left alone and why it is a good thing when some players fight.","answer":"Let me actually do this first part as a parable for a 5YO, then I will explain. \n\nSuppose you had to carry a bat to kindergarten everyday. You had to hold that bat up across your chest through the crowed halls of your school. As you pass down the halls, you are bumping other kids with your stick. Some of them are bigger, some are smaller. Soon, one kid thinks you are seeking him out to bump with your bat. He wants to hit you over the head with his bat. \n\nThis kid knows that if he taps you with his bat, or if he throws a punch at you, or if he hits you over the head, he is going to get in a lot of trouble. He may even have to miss school for a few days. Eventually, he decides that hitting you over the head or punching you in the face is going to have the same penalty, so he comes up behind you and hits you on the head. \n\nLet's say this happens enough so the teachers and the principal decide that if you feel you have been getting bumped with a bat often enough, you can punch someone, but only if you **both** drop your bats and no one else gets in the fight. See, fewer kids get hurt, and there is no serious hurt put on anyone. The teachers even put in rules saying that if you use a bat in a fight, you are put out of school for the rest of the year, but if you use only hands, you only have to miss a class in school. \n\nSo you get the idea, \"Why should I hurt myself in a fight if the penalty is so minor and the bat bumping is going to happen anyway?\" You decide you are going to get a friend who is bigger than you who can throw a punch and never uses a bat to fight for you. He hates nap time anyway and that is when he will fight. \n\nIn hockey, you got guys who are constantly hitting each other. Some of the hits are legit, some are to punish a player. If the players were not allowed to drop the sticks, drop the gloves, and square off on the ice, more harm may occur. The refs allow the fights to happen because both players tire out easy from trying to skate while being pummeled in the face. When the players have had enough, the refs skate in to break it up to the relief of the fighters. "},
{"title":"ELI5 - Rugby. I just don't get it","question_detail":"I've watched and read some stuff online, but it doesn't make any sense to me.","answer":"Basic rules for rugby union (rugby league is slightly different):\n\nTwo teams, 15 players on each team.\n\nThe aim is to get the ball to the far end of the pitch, then touch the ball to the ground and score a \"try\". A try is worth 5 points, and after scoring a try your team is allowed to try to \"convert\" it by taking a place-kick and kicking the ball through the posts - this will score another 2 points.\n\nThe most important rule is that you're not allowed to throw the ball forward. Also, if you're in front of the ball, you're not allowed to affect the play - if you do, that's judged to be off-side.\n\nSo how do you move the ball forward? Mostly by running whilst holding the ball. Generally, you run until you meet a member of the opposite team. He will try to tackle you - to bring you to the ground by wrapping his arms around your legs. You pass the ball - throw it (backwards, because you're not allowed to throw forwards) to another player on your team before you are tackled.\n\nVery often, if you don't get your pass away in time, players from both sides will grab onto you and form either a ruck or a maul. In a maul, you try to pass the ball backwards out of the mall towards your awaiting players, whilst simultaneously trying to push forwards to break down the opposing team's bonds onto you. They, meanwhile, are trying to push forwards to break up your team, and if successful, they may be able to take the ball from you. A ruck looks similar, except that the ball has either fallen to the ground or been placed there by a player. Once this happens, you are not allowed to pick the ball up again until it has exited the ruck. The aim of the players in the ruck is to drive forward and push the other team off the ball, so that when the ball comes out the back of the ruck, awaiting players on your team can pick it up.\n\nThere are several reasons for stopping a game, and different ways of re-starting it:\n\nThere's a forward pass, or a \"knock on\" where you accidentally touch the ball and it goes forward. This is re-started by the other team throwing the ball into a scrum, where the two teams' forwards lock together in a very specific pattern and attempt to kick the ball backwards out of the scrum to their awaiting team-mates - a bit like a ruck, but with more rigidly defined positions for the players.\n\nMany offences are re-started with a penalty. Here, a player on the team awarded the penalty places the ball on the ground before kicking it. If he's close enough to the far end of the pitch, he can attempt to kick it between the posts to score 3 points. Otherwise, he can either kick it at the opposing team (loosing possession, but gaining territory), or he can attempt to kick it out of play to the side of the pitch.\n\nAnd if the ball goes out of the side of the field, the team which did not put the ball out (with a couple of exceptions) is awarded a line-out. The forwards of both teams form parallel lines, and the team who have the line-out have one of their players throw the ball at the two lines for someone to catch.\n\nFinally, the other way of scoring, which isn't seen too often, is a drop-goal. The ball has to be dropped onto the ground, then, after it bounces, it has to be kicked between the posts.\n"},

When you hear an ad and flip the station and hear the *same* ad playing on the other station -- sometimes that's not an accident....\n\nNow maybe this only works when one company owns several local stations and maybe this isn't allowed any more, but they definitely *used* to be able to sync up the commercial time between stations down to the exact commercial slot.\n\n(For what it's worth, I never bought the \"road blocks\" because I found them obnoxious as a listener.)\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: What is the Significance of Dell becoming a private company?","question_detail":"I'm not too clear on what it means to be a public or private company.

But shareholders only invest in companies that make a lot of money and sell a lot of products.\n\nThat's not necessarily a **bad** thing, but it often means that companies are scared of trying something new/different, because it might fail and not sell very well. So they just do the same thing over and over again, because at least someone will buy it.\n\nBy going private, Dell no longer has to worry about what the shareholders think. This means they can experiment a bit more, and - if they fail - it's okay (obviously not *great*, but it won't destroy them)."},

{"title":"How does bandwidth work?  Specifically, how does my cable box flawlessly stream HD content without buffering while my internet takes five minutes to load a four minute 480p video?","answer":"Your cable box does not \"stream\" anything at all. It works on completely different principles.\n\nTelevision is an example of *synchronous, circuit-switched* communication. Signals (which may or may not be digital; they're usually not) are coming at you all the time at a constant rate. In the case of television, the signals are multiplexed based on fundamental frequency â¦Â which is just a fancy way of saying you get every signal all the time, coming in at that same constant rate always. Your equipment chooses which one to \"listen\" to.\n\nThe Internet is an *asynchronous, packet-switched* communications system. Your equipment only ever receives a single signal at any given time. In order to fit multiple distinct signals down the pipe, each one is broken down into chunks and fed to you chunk-by-chunk. You are not guaranteed to get those chunks at a constant rate; in fact, you're all but guaranteed *not* to. In order to \"convert\" from that chunk-by-chunk, asynchronous, digital signal to a continuous, synchronous, analog signal, your equipment has to stash away a bunch of chunks in anticipation of future chunks being delayed. Under the best circumstances, your equipment stores up a sufficiently large reserve of chunks that it never stalls waiting for the next chunk, though they come completely irregularly and unpredictably. But it's often the case that it doesn't work out that way.\n\nOr put more simply, the Internet does not deliver synchronous signals because it was never designed to deliver synchronous signals. For a couple decades now, computer nerds have been trying to squeeze the square peg of synchronous broadcast into the round hole of asynchronous packet-switching. It fundamentally doesn't work, though people do get closer from time to time."},
{"title":"ELI5: what exactly is torque (specifically when describing a pickup truck specs)","question_detail":"I keep seeing ads and such and they stress how X truck has \"355 lbs of torque \".","answer":"Torque is a measure of how much force a car's engine can put out, whereas horsepower is how much power it produces. These terms are somewhat interchangeable in common parlance, but mean very different things in physics.\n\nBasically, torque (and force, which, in this context, are interchangeable) is a measure of something's ability to induce acceleration. If you're trying to push a block, you have to apply a force to it to cause it to start moving. The amount of force you apply will cause it to move depending on the object's mass, so, if you push a block as hard as you can, a block twice as big will move half as fast under the same force.\n\nSo, basically, a car needs torque to cause it to start moving. Heavy cars like trucks, especially ones that need to do towing, need a lot of torque because it takes more to get them moving because of their weight."},

{"title":"What are income and substitution effects (in economic terms)?","answer":"The income effect is a pretty basic concept. It is when someone's income rises and therefore they have more money to buy more of everything they like.\n\nThe substitution effect is a little more complicated. It is when the price of a certain good changes, and a person changes their consumption of other goods based on that change. Typically, if the price of a good rises, the person will consume more of other goods (whose prices didn't change) instead, ie they will \"substitute\" with other goods.\n\nFor example, let's say I like to eat both apples and oranges, and I consume on average 5 apples and 5 oranges per week. If I have a positive income effect (I get more money), I can buy more of both, and consume 6 apples and 6 oranges per week. If the price of oranges increases, I may decide to instead consume 7 apples and 3 oranges per week because apples are relatively cheaper, and that would be a substitution effect."},

So why is China always referred to as communist?","answer":"China was conquered by a Communist army led by Mao Zedong in 1949. From 1949 to the late 1970s, it was run like a completely by the book Communist country, as other posters have described. \n\nTrouble was, Communism is a shitty way to run an economy, and by the late 70s Mao was dead and his successors were willing to open up a little and introduce some capitalist reforms in order to help it along. This worked pretty well, and so by the late 1980s and 1990s they had relaxed the rules a whole hell of a lot, economy-wise, so that in many ways China was almost as capitalist as the West.\n\nBut there were and are some important differences. For one, all this rule-loosening was *strictly* on the business side of things  --- not on the politics side. There is one political party in China, and it's the Communist party. No free press, no elections, none of that stuff. \n\nTwo, even though the state was letting more and more people do their own thing in order to create successful businesses, the state didn't stop doing stuff itself. It still owns plenty of factories, businesses, real estate, etc. And it still has plenty of say in every aspect of how every other company gets run. Basically, you need government approval for everything, and if the government wants to do something it gets done --- there's no individual proprty rights, which many people regard as fundamental to a successful capitalist society. Some government official wants to knock down your house so his buddy can put a highway there, it happens, and you're lucky if you get some money for it. \n\nNot to say there aren't shady, buddy-buddy dealings in the West.

Something mechanism that isn't fully understood yet, 'resets' the cell, so it grows again, and then it gets 'reset' again, and continues to grow and so on.\n\nCancer is one of the oldest known deseases to humans.  Ancient Greeks knew about it, and when they operated on a cancerous patient - or did an autopsy - the saw that the cancerous tissue looked like crab meat, so gave us its name.\n\nThere are basically two types of cancer, malignant and benign.\n\nA benign cancer is contained in one area.  These are generally fairly easy to treat - usually with an operation. \n\nA malignant cancer will show up in one area of your body - say a mole or skin cancer - and then shift to another part of your body.  This is generally through the blood stream.\n\nEven if you remove the malignant cancer from its original source, the same cancer can grow elsewhere in the body.\n\nTumors can put pressure on vital organs - lungs, bowl, brain, heart etc.\n\nThe act of growing a cancer takes up a lot of your body's energy, so you will be weaker in general, and then more prone to disease."},
{"title":"Why people say that increasing the minimum wage would increase inflation?","question_detail":"I don't live in the US, so I don't really understand the economy there.","answer":"Regarding the recent idea of raising the minimum wage: I don't see how it directly affects inflation, but generally speaking, it causes problems.\n\nIf the proprietor of Business X has $14 for employment purposes, and the minimum wage is $7, he can afford two employees. If the wage is raised, to say, $9, he can only get one employee. This results in higher unemployment because small business-owners cannot hire people.\n\nMaybe I misunderstood this, but that is one inherent problem with raising the MW to much."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why do GIFs take longer to load than videos?","answer":"It's because of the different compression methods used.  \n\nA .gif is every single frame of the video, one at a time, loading as a separate image.  The compression methods are generally lowering the image quality of each frame, for example by restricting the colour palette or using a blank pattern overlay to reduce the number of pixels.  \n\nVideo compression is more sophisticated.  In general the commonly used compression algorithms will check each pixel of each frame against the next and looks for changes.  That is why in heavily compressed videos you get artefacts around areas of movement.  \n\nUncompressed video file size is huge.  "},

{"title":"ELI5: Differences between analog/digital recording","question_detail":"Thanks in advance!","answer":"Lets talk about recording sound in general:\n\nSound is made up of pressure waves in the air. Just like waves in the sea, there will be high bits, then low bits, then high bits again, over and over.\n\nNow, analogue recording would be if you took a pen and paper, and drew the shape of that wave. It would be accurate.... but it might get smudged a bit, and then it would be less accurate.\n\nIn digital recording, you don't draw the wave. Instead, you measure how high it is at very small intervals, and you write the height of the wave down on a piece of paper. You end up with a long list of numbers. Using these numbers, if you wanted to, you could draw the wave - but what you're going to store, and send to your friends, is the list of numbers. The great thing about digital is that if the paper on which the numbers are written gets a bit smudged, then so long as you can still make out what the numbers are, the actual wave, when you draw it again, won't be smudged at all."},
{"title":"ELI5: American Prison Cells","question_detail":"How do prison cells in the United States split up their prisoners? Is it divided by felony, length of sentence, etc?","answer":"I watch a lot of prison reality shows (Lockup, etc.) and based on what I've learned, it's based on several factors:\n\nSeverity of a crime is the primary factor. Prisons tend to separate minimum security inmates (most non-violent) and maximum security inmates (mostly violent).\n\nWhen it comes to maximum security inmates, there is the general population which is the majority of the inmates. These inmates live in a cell, usually with another person, and locked up only at night. During the day, they eat in the dining hall and hang out in the yard and recreation room with other inmates. \n\nThere is protective custody which is for prisoners who need protection from other inmates. People in protective custody often include rapists, child molesters, snitches, and gang drop-outs. Protective custody inmates are isolated from general population and are usually allowed less time out of their cells for their own protection.\n\nLastly, there is isolation or lockdown. This is for problem inmates who are a threat to other prisoners or staff. They placed in cells by themselves, usually for 24 hours a day. They are only allowed out of their cells for a couple hours a week, usually for showering and exercise. All their meals are delivered to them through a slot in the door. Inmates who behave themselves can eventually be returned to general population.\n\nMany prisons also have a psych ward for suicidal or mentally ill prisoners. They are kept in a separate part of the prison so they don't harm themselves or others. Staff checks on them regularly to ensure their well-being.\n\nAs for dividing inmates based length of sentence, there doesn't seem to be a whole lot about it. Prisons are very transitory places with people coming in and out all the time. Most American prisons are severely overcrowd so sorting inmates out by sentence length would be a logistical nightmare.\n\n\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: The differences between a liberal and a conservative and a republican and a democrat. ","question_detail":"As unbiased as possible, of course.","answer":"When it comes to liberal and conservative,I think you need to split it up by context.\n\nEconomics:\nLiberals tend to believe in increased government intervention in economic matters. This includes more welfare programs, environmental regulations, and so on. As a result, liberals tend to be more for increased government spending and taxation. Conservatives tend to believe the government should stay out of economic matters and let the free market regulate itself. Conservatives tend to be for less taxes and government spending.\n\nSociety:\nLiberals tend be more for equality and choice in terms of sex, marriage, race, child rearing, etc. Conservatives tend to favor more \"traditional\" values. As for each side's opinion when it comes to government intervention in social matters, it really depends on the individual. Gay marriage is a good example. Some liberals want a government policy that is pro-gay marriage while some conservatives want a government policy that is anti-gay marriage. But many other conservatives and liberals want the government to stay out of the marriage business entirely.\n\nDemocrats tend to be more liberal and Republicans more conservative. But this isn't absolute and changes with history. In the 1960s, the Democrats used to be very popular in the South and for racial segregation. The Republicans have their roots in anti-slavery movements."},

{"title":"ELI5: Stenotype","question_detail":"I'm wondering how stenotype (those typing machines they use in court rooms, etc.) works, how it is read, and why it is so much faster than traditional typing.  Also what is the advantage vs. simply digitally recording the proceedings.  ","answer":"Stenotypes aren't like 'normal' keyboards. They only have 22 keys in total - including numbers. (Note: there are probably exceptions to this, but it seems to be the most common configuration).\n\nThis means stenographers don't type in full sentences. They type in 'shorthand', which is like a completely separate language, but much *quicker* to type because it has less characters. For example, the word 'MACHINE' could be written as 'PHPB' (almost a 50% reduction in characters, and almost 60% reduction in *unique* characters).\n\nHow to *read* it is much, much harder. I believe there are 3+ year college courses on how to become a fluent stenographer, so it's not something you just pick up overnight. The same characters can have completely different meanings depending on their context. Look at [this example from Wikipedia](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/cf/Steno-example.gif) which shows the shorthand on the left, and the plaintext translation on the right.\n\n&gt; what is the advantage vs. simply digitally recording the proceedings. \n\nAs technology improves, the advantage becomes less and less meaningful. Initially, stenotypes were critical because digital recording simply didn't exist, or wasn't an option in regional areas. Now, it's pretty ubiquitous.\n\nThen it became a 'backup tool', in case the software/hardware failed. Now it's getting more and more reliable.\n\nNow, digital recording as well as speech-to-text recognition is getting very good. At some point (once we work out the kinks), it will replace stenographers altogether because the perceived 'advantages' won't exist anymore (which is kind of a bittersweet thing). The big advantage of digital recordings is that they preserve the *original* proceeding in all its glory, and it's much harder for anyone to tamper with it."},

He rules by a sort of \"divine right\" -- Pope Benedict XVI has mentioned how he was \"chosen by God\", even though the correct answer is he was chosen by a conclave of Cardinals voting and re-voting until they come to a clear (I think it's 2/3) consensus. \n\nIf you are Catholic, the Pope's words and interpretations of holy scripture are considered perfect. So however the Pope interprets the Bible, for example, everyone else has to conform to it, because the Pope is believed to have a divine connection to the spirit of God and is the only one who can interpret God's will perfectly. This is the essence of \"Papal infallibility\". \n\nTheoretically, if the Pope did say that homosexuality was not an affront to God, then every diocese would need to conform to this way of thinking.\n\nBut that's only if you are Catholic, or just like the hats."},

{"title":"Why is a semi tractor (truck) transmission unsynchronized and have so many gears?  Essentially, why in our modern age do I still need to double-clutch my semi?","question_detail":"I'm a truck driver, but the idea as to why we have 10-speeds and no synchronizers is baffling.  I get they are extremely heavy vehicles and need a torque range, but the design has been roughly unchanged for half a century despite so many advances in gear technology.\n\nEdit: Ignore the bad grammar.","answer":"While engines make their best torque, they're also running pretty efficiently. All those gears are to keep the engine in that rev range for as long as possible while getting up to your cruising speed. That's why you have so many gears, and from your question I think you knew that part of it, but it's important to understand for the second part.\n\nGearboxes with lots of gears have LOTS of moving parts that need to all be really strong and adding synchronizers means building a bigger unit, with more moving parts. It adds a lot more complexity and where there's added complexity there's usually a higher risk of something going wrong, and usually more expensive to fix if it does go wrong. Gearboxes are expensive to fix.\n\nZF make the 8HP gearbox for cars, which is an 8-speed. It will take up to 663 lb-ft of torque and weighs a little over 200 pounds. I imagine that your motor produces at least 4 times as much torque, and so everything would need to be bigger, stronger and heavier.\n\nThe good news is that I've seen a documentary that included footage of a gearbox that didn't need double-clutching, so chances are good in a truck or two's time you'll have one that doesn't need to double-clutch. Another thing to bear in mind is that with the ever-increasing number of gears in car gearboxes (and car gearboxes are ALWAYS synchronized), we're getting to the point where all a gearbox manufacturer has to do is make a car gearbox stronger to make a truck box. That also means you're not far off them being common.\n"},
{"title":"ELI5 Why are English classes mandatory in high school?","question_detail":"I understand that it's supposed to help us with writing, but I can't see how they're supposed to do that. I've spent the entire year just reading books written hundreds of years ago, usually not even in English. We've only read two books written by English speakers, and one of them was Shakespeare. I'm not saying that I think Shakespeare was a bad writer, but learning how to write using archaic words and weird grammar just sounds stupid. Plus, we don't even look at writing from a functional perspective. We'll just spend days looking at one paragraph and talking about symbols, imagery, and rhetoric. So how is this supposed to be important enough to require 4 years of classes, while no other subjects (the ones with any practical applications) require more than 3?","answer":"My company recently fired a tech guy. His manager had told him \"fix this application, and then email the client when it's done\". Twenty-four hours later, the manager received a scathing phone call from the client \"I've just received an email with one word: 'Done'. What the hell's been done, and why is some guy emailing me such retarded messages?\" When the tech guy was summoned he explained with what he thought was biting sarcasm \"I just did what you told me to.\"\n\nHad the tech guy paid attention in English class, he'd have known not to take words at face value. He'd know that different scenarios require different responses, often to the point where the same message has to be delivered in two completely different styles because of your relationship with the two recipients (in this case, the boss and the client).\n\nAt the age of 14 or 16 or even 18, most people still haven't been in enough different life situations to know how to change their language. Some are smart enough not to say \"yo dawg\" to their grandmother or \"What ho there good chap\" to the postman, but there are still 1001 social situations that you're just not prepared for yet.\n\nLiterature helps that. Almost every book you read at school, whether its writer was English or not, is based around the characters reacting with each other in a variety of social situations. From Shakespeare's comedies through Shaw's \"Pygmalion\" via Jane Austen, you're seeing thousands of lines of dialogue in hundreds of different circumstances. Some are funny, some are tragic, but all are so beautifully nuanced that they're utterly believable; the writer had such skill that you were able to believe these characters, these products of one person's imagination, are interacting in a way that you believe is realistic; you'd say the same thing in their shoes if only you were so witty. \n\nYou'll note that none of the books you read at school have dialogue of \"and I was like and she was like and then he went and I was just so Oh My God!\" Not because it's not real English (of course it is!) but because you already know how to talk like that; it's the other styles you need to learn, whether its aloof reservedness, servantile obsequiousness or self-depricating humour.\n\nWhat's more, by being forced to read something you wouldn't choose yourself, you're working your way into the very core of our shared culture. Trekkies form an instant bond when one overhears the phrase \"Beam me up\", but my mother found those films idiotic when I watched them as a kid. That is, until one Klingon warlord declared \"Cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war!\" She was the only one in the cinema crying with laughter (sci-fi fans don't usually read Shakespearean histories), but it certainly enamoured her more to the franchise because she'd found a cultural link to something she knew. If we all learn the same books then we all have something in common; like a private joke shared among the 500bn native speakers of English."},

Like maybe 'SH'?\n\nHave they always been pronounced this way? In English at least?","answer":"*Please be prepared, this is a long post!*\n\nRoughly speaking, the spelling of English has changed little in the last 700 years. On the other hand, many changes in pronunciation have happened in that time. \n\nThe written language always changes more slowly than the spoken language, so that's part of the reason why we have silent letters and spelling rules that now seem strange to us.\n\nThe 'k' in 'knight' would have been pronounced a few centuries ago. So would the 'g' in 'gnat.'\n\nThe GH digraph (that is, a combination of 2 letters) is a bit more complicated. In Old English, which was spoken over 800 years ago, it represented a sound like the 'ch' in German, or 'j' in Spanish, at least in the middle and at the end of a word. Linguists call this sound a velar fricative. It was simply written as H, and wasn't distinct from the H in 'hat', for example.\n\nBut when the printing press was invented, French scribes were unfamiliar with the sound, so they represented it as GH. Eventually, in about the 1500s, the English language lost the original velar fricative sound.\n\nIt disappeared before another consonant, as in 'knight' or 'weight' and in some cases it was also lost at the end of a word. But at the end of some words, the sound changed to /f/, usually before an /o/ or /u/ sound. So we have 'enough' and 'laugh', with an /f/ sound, but also some exceptions like 'through'.\n\nEnglish spelling hasn't caught up with changes in pronunciation, so that's why we still have the GH digraph, which is a relic of a former sound that has now been lost.\n\n*tl;dr - English spelling is a mess because the written language has changed much more slowly than the spoken language*"},

Explain like I'm five please!\nEDIT: I'm referring to the one done on quantum level where photons change their behavior based on observation","answer":"The double slit experiment shows that photons can behave like waves as well as particles.\nWhen you send a photon towards two very small slits and don't try to measure what happens, you get interesting results when you later look where the photon went after it went through the slits.\nWhat you see is an interference pattern, even though it was a single photon. This is because the photon, acting as a wave, will go through both slits, which effectively splits it into two new sources of waves, which then will interfere with each other.\nIt can help to imagine you have a body of water with a screen dividing it in two, with two very small slits in the screen. If you create a wave in one half, when the wave reaches the slits, water will travel through but will then 'bloom' out on the other side, from both slits. When these two 'blooms' meet you will get the geometric interference pattern and this can be measured once it reaches the other end too.\nIt is from seeing this interference pattern even for one photon that shows we can treat photons both as particles (the photoelectric effect is evidence for this) and waves."},

However, when he died, none of his sons were still alive, so he had no direct heirs.\n\nSunni Muslims believe that Muhammad never named a successor, and that Abu Bakr was elected by the Muslim community.\n\nThe Shia believe that before his death, Muhammad put his cousin and son-in-law Ali in charge of the Muslim community, and that his leadership was therefore the rule of the prophet.\n\nBecause the two groups disagree over who was named as the first caliph (leader of the Muslim community), there is now disagreement over who came after them, as well. It gets a little more complicated, too, with early wars, and with the death of Ali.\n\nAs far as who is more extreme - they're just different branches of Islam, and the vast majority of Muslims around the world are not radical fundamentalists. Sunnis make up the majority of the world's Muslim population (75% or so), and Shia are in the minority. When you hear about violence between Sunni and Shia groups, this has to do with local power distribution, and not with one group being more extreme than the other.\n\n*clarity"},

All of the sudden things changed. It seems like she would have dreams at night while at home or day dream while in school that I treated her crappy. I can give a couple examples, that come to my mind right off the top of my head.( The ones I remember the most)\n\nOne time,during class, we had assigned seats and so I had to sit next to her. She whispered to someone next to her, and said \"I'm about to throw my book at her.\" The person: \"why?\" Her:\" Because she won't leave me alone and won't stop talking to me when I'm trying to do my work, and causing trouble.\" \n\nIn reality: I wasn't talking to her and was trying to do my work myself.\n\nThe second example I remember quiet well is one morning I walked in to school, and someone had came up to me and told me leave and alone. She had apparently told the person, that I started causing trouble with her as soon as I walked in the door. \n\nReality: I haven't seen her yet, at all that morning. \n\nI thought she was just starting to cause trouble with me on purpose but apparently she does this to EVERYONE she knows, and adults  described it  as if  she dreams things up, and thinks its really happening, so if she  has a bad dream at night or starts day dreaming during school or wherever about someone doing her wrong, she honestly thinks it really happened in reality. \n\nWhat the issue?

{"title":"ELI5: Why after being out in the cold and then entering a warm room causes you to itch so much?","answer":"Well, in order to answer your question, there are two parts to it. First off, an itch is when there is blood coming to your skin. Specifically what causes an itch, I'm not too sure, but when you have a mosquito bite and you scratch or rub it, it itches more. That is because the blood comes to the area you touch (in this case the bite) causing a more intense itching sensation.\n\nAs for coming from the cold to warmth, you need to know how your body reacts. When you are in a cold place, your body wants to protect itself from losing that perfect temperature to run. So it \"wraps the important parts in a blanket,\" which is your blood. The blood vessels contract (get smaller) so less blood can get through and keep it around your important organs in your torso and abdomen. That is why your skin will change some color and fingers get white and feel cold--the blood is not going to them as much because they are not as important as say, your heart. When you enter the heat, your body recognizes that temperature and releases the blood vessels so the blood can get to your skin and farther from your middle (called distal). So that influx of blood creates the same reaction as when you rub that mosquito bite from earlier, making you itchy."},

{"title":"Where did the term \"black mail\" come from?","question_detail":"when someone is getting\"black mailed\" for someone else's gain, where did that expression come from?","answer":"The word is variously derived from the word for tribute (in modern terms, protection racket) paid by English and Scottish border dwellers to Border Reivers in return for immunity from raids and other harassment. The \"mail\" part of blackmail derives from Middle English male, \"rent, tribute.\" This tribute was paid in goods or labour (reditus nigri, or \"blackmail\"); the opposite is blanche firmes or reditus albi, or \"white rent\" (denoting payment by silver). Alternatively, Mckay derives it from two Scottish Gaelic words blathaich pronounced (the th silent) bla-ich (to protect) and mal (tribute, payment). He notes that the practice was common in the Highlands of Scotland as well as the Borders. \n\n- [Wikipedia] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackmail#Etymology)"},
{"title":"ELI5: How do websites automatically know what city you are in?","answer":"There are a few different options that are available for web programmers to identify a visitor's location:\n\n\nIn the past there were providers that offered geolocation services by querying databases of IP addresses with records of blocks that had been issued to ISPs in different areas. So when you visit a site, the site can make a call to a geolocation service (or its own database) to try to get your approximate location. This still works well for most applications that just need a simple approximation of your area and is handled by the server hosting the site.\n\n\nNow in HTML5 the WC3 Geolocation API is beginning to become more commonplace (although not supported by all browsers). Browsers that do support it can make a location request to their ISP which is directed to a nearby Location Information Server which provides location information for web apps as well as 911 service. Using a combination of it's own database as well as wiremapping, the LIS is able to return a fairly accurate approximate location of where the request is coming from. This method is actually handled by your browser which passes the information back to the server with cookies or javascript.\n\n\nThe second option is being used more and more by web services because it is built right into the network and doesn't require 3rd party services and possibly outdated databases of IP addresses. If you're using google chrome and see a message about a site wanting to know your location this is what it's."},

{"title":"ELI5-Dreams","question_detail":"Why do we have them? How exactly do they work? And why do we sometimes have the most messed up dreams?","answer":"It is currently believed that dreams are mostly a by-product of your brain processing memories.  Your brain has short, medium, and long term memory (sorta). The brain needs to sometimes do some housekeeping to clear old crap out of the medium term memory and fix some of it really well into long-term memory. In the process, some memories get replayed in a way that your brain interprets them as really happening.  \n  \nIn addition, during sleep parts of your brain are in a low-activity state. So parts of your brain that would normally say \"Hey...pigs can't sing!\" aren't working well or simply aren't giving attention to your unusual thoughts. So stuff that you would normally realize is quite abnormal get accepted as perfectly OK.  "},

{"title":"ELI5 why almost all American politicians are against Socialized healthcare","answer":"For three reasons. First, as a general principle, an open-market solution to a problem is going to work better than a centralized solution. That's just a thing that's true so often it can't be tossed aside without explanation.\n\nSecond, American legislators don't live in a bubble. They know that single-payer systems around the world are still experiments, and it's not at all clear that they're going to end up working out. So it's both easy and rather reasonable to say \"Are we *really sure* this is a good idea?\"\n\nAnd finally, the American people have significant experience with single-payer health care, through something called the Veteran's Administration. It's a purely government-run health care system that's existed (in a form that's relevant here) since 1930 â¦Â and it's been basically a non-stop problem. The standard of care has tended to be low, the rationing of care have been controversial, and the inefficiencies have been a non-stop source of criticism from every corner.\n\nAll that adds up to a basic conclusion: While single-payer health care *sounds like a good idea,* it's not entirely clear that anybody's ever figured out *how to make it work* in practice. Because of that, there's a natural, and entirely understandable, reluctance to jump right into it, since there's little reason to be hopeful for a positive outcome.\n\nThe *very minute* somebody comes along with a proposal that actually seems plausible, though, you can bet everybody will jump at it. Because everybody agreed that while health care in the US is top-shelf, getting it is a *giant* pain in the butt, even for those who are best equipped to go through the process."},
{"title":"If the temperature is zero degree, how could is it when it's twice as cold?","question_detail":"My gf asked me this question today to see if I have an answer to this (and eventually proof that I'm dumb).\n\nWhat she means is:\nAt a certain temperature you have a feeling of this temperature and therefore you could somehow say something like \"It's twice as cold as at zero degree.\" (Talking about Celsius but works in Fahrenheit as well.)\n\nI tried to explain that you could use Kelvin because it's an absolute scale and define \"twice as cold\" as \"half as warm\". For 0Â° Celsius (~ 273Â°K), twice as cold would mean -136.5Â° C. What I think was definitely not what she had on mind.\n\nEDIT:\nWithout a reference point there is no way to answer this question. But for everyone there is a temperature at which he/she feels cold. So if someone feels cold below 20Â°, twice as cold as 0Â° would be double the difference between 0Â° and 20Â°... what is -20Â°.\n\nThanks for the answers!\n","answer":"your major problem is, how do you define cold?\nyou cant relate the word \"cold\" to an absolute value on the kelvin scale, because cold is a relative value. \ncompared to the surface temperature of the sun, the temperature in your furnace is pretty cold, and yet its actually fucking hot compared to the normal temperatures of feeling warm for a human.\nnow adjusting that one to human feel, we state, a human feels warm at 20Â°C.\nnow at 18Â°C you feel cold, because there is a difference of 2Â°C to feeling warm.

{"title":"ELI5: Why have advances in older technologies (cars, planes, home appliances) been so much slower over the last 20-30 years than the high tech (computers, phones, etc.)","question_detail":"In other words, where the fuck is my flying car?","answer":"It has taken incredible effort to make cars cleaner and more efficient.  It is very difficult to make batteries denser with energy yet safe to use.  It takes years of research to produce a better drug (more effective with less incidence of side effects) than the previous one.\n\nBut the number of transistors you can put on the same size microchip doubles every 18 months.\n\nEvery.\n\nFreakin'.\n\n18.\n\nMonths.\n\nThis is called Moore's Law.  It hasn't been *easy* to do this; much research has gone into it (for example, features on chips are so damn small, we've had to go to smaller and smaller wavelengths of light to accurately photograph those features onto the chips).  But this exponential increase in the number of transistors has been *going like clockwork* since the early 1970's.  And with a few cautions, it's going to continue for a while yet.\n\nHow sophisticated a device is largely depends on how much processing power it has, which of course depends on the number of transistors.  It needs good software, of course, but you couldn't make an iPhone before the dense electronics to support the software came into existence.  Put it this way: a basic feature phone (not even a smart phone!), if it were made of naked-eye transistors like you can buy at Radio Shack, would have to be the size of the Washington Memorial.\n\nNo other industry has been able to sustain this kind of growth in usefulness, sophistication, efficiency, etc. because the secret of the semiconductor industry's success is that it is the virtually the only industry where it is possible to keep making the components smaller and cram more of them into the same space.\n\nAs for your flying car:  it's going to take far more than GPS, an autopilot and an entertainment system to get it off the ground.

{"title":"What makes chemicals \"acidic\" or \"base\" as a definition?","question_detail":"Asked by my 5 year old for a definition of vinegar and baking soda.","answer":"There are a number of definitions of bases and acids.\n\n**Arrhenius' Hydrogen Theory of Acids and Bases, which won the Nobel Prize in 1903**\n\nAcids dissociate (their component parts separate) in water to form Hydrogen ions (H^+ ), and bases dissociate to form Hydroxide ions (OH^- ).\n\nThe examples you've given are Arrhenius acids or bases - in water, some of the vinegar (which is primarily made up of ethanoic/acetic acid (different names, same compound), which has the chemical formula C2O2H2 and looks like [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Acetic-acid-2D-flat.png)) breaks down into two seperate parts - one of them is made up of most of the molecule and the other is the lone Hydrogen ion that wanders off.\n\nBaking soda is Sodium Bicarbonate which looks like [this](http://0.tqn.com/d/chemistry/1/0/T/a/sodiumbicarbonate.jpg).  When it dissolves in water it breaks down into two separate pieces, this time losing an OH^- or hydroxide ion.\n\nHow strong an acid or base is depends on the concentration of H^+ or OH^- ions present.\n\n**Bronsted-Lowry Theory, formulated in 1923**\nThe Bronsted-Lowry theory defines an acid as a substance which can donate protons (hydrogen ions) and a base is one that can accept them.  Both of your examples are also Bronsted-Lowry bases, but this theory covers many other compounds that don't have oxygen in them but are still bases, like ammonia compounds.\n\n**Lewis Theory, also published in 1923**\nSomewhat more complicated, but the most catch-all definition currently in \"popular\" use.  Acids are *electron pair acceptors* and bases are *electron pair donators*. This definition is handy because it expands the idea to substances that don't contain hydrogen, such as Aluminium Chloride or Boron Fluoride.\n\nTo conclude, vinegar and baking soda are examples of a Lewis Acid and Base, as well as a Bronsted Lowry Acid and Base and an Arrhenius acid and base.  Sorry if this overcomplicates things a little, but it's basically because baking soda likes grabbing hydrogen ions and vinegar likes getting rid of them.\n\n  "},
{"title":"ELI5: How do law firms work ?","question_detail":"I've recently been watching a lot of Suits and Franklin and Bash so I'm interested how a firm operates.   \n\nThings like:    \n                                                                                              \n* What all the different positions in a firm and what jobs they carry out ?\n\n* Who answers to who ?\n\nand similar type stuff.                                     ","answer":"When law firms first started,  they had to be partnerships. This basically means that the people who start or become the 'bosses' of the firm all do business in their joint names personally. So for example, the lease for the office would be in their joint names.\n\nThis is because for professionals,  (and I do refer to the actual professional jobs as opposed to any white collar job referred to these days) should be personally liable for the advice or service they give.\n\nNow and days,  some countries allow for a 'limited liability partnership'. This means that they can form a company of sorts and use that as a vehicle. The benefit is that you can run the firm as a company, but the individual lawyers will still be open to disciplinary action from the relevant regulatory body.\n\nHow a firm is structured shares a similar layout, but the titles will vary from firm to firm.\n\nAt the top level you get partners. These are considered the managerial level. At the very top you get the equity partners.  These are the partners who get a direct share in the profit of the firm, which are pretty enormous.  These partners are usually required to pay in a sum as an investment in the firm.  From this caste, you also will get the managing partner who is the head of the firm.  The other type is a salaried partner. These get a salary but not receive any share of the profits directly. This is basically the entry level partner.\n\nThe work of the partners is to bring in business and to oversee the work of the lawyers.  Partners tend to have their own big clients who provide regular businesses. In bigger firms, partners usually run a department, such as litigation or shipping.  They will delegate work to the team and basically make sure the work is being done properly.\n\nTo make partner, it will really depend. You will generally need good experience to lead a team and to handle a good base of clients to justify a team. They tend to have quotas as to how many hours are billed from clients.\n\nAt the next level is the lawyers.  These are the rank and file of a law firm. Some firms may differentiate between senior and normal level lawyers (usually called associate and senior associates). The work they do tend to be the bulk of the work a team does. They report to the partner. Many firms also have a quota of how many hours a lawyer will need to bill.\n\nYou then get the training lawyers.  A law firm is actually set up as an apprenticeship in a way; as you make your way up, you learn more and more.  Of course the field of law, even in the specific fields, are so in depth that you can't truly learn it all.  Anyways, these depend on the jurisdiction as to their duration of training and title, such as trainee solicitor or whatever.  After their time is up and their training is finished, they can be a proper lawyer and join as an associate.  They generally can't give legal advice yet to clients, but their work is pretty much research on issues, as well as some drafting and basic legal work which will depend again on which department or field of work.\n\nBelow this are the non-legal staff.  Paralegals fall under this, where their work is quite similar to the training lawyers.  They may tend to do more clerical work though, such as preparing spreadsheets, etc.  Many paralegals tend to go on to do or finish their legal training.\n\nThe work that each \"caste\" does is based on one key factor; the hourly rate.  As you can imagine, the  partners will charge much more than say, a newly qualified associate.  As you go up in years of experience, your hourly rates tend to go up (to a certain limit within your position).  The practical side of this is that clients obviously won't want a partner spending 6 hours stamping numbers on a court hearing bundle. The general rule is, the more difficult and complex but less time consuming it is, the higher up it goes.  So suppose there is a simple insurance case of a slip and fall.  The firm acts for the Defendant, say, the store (and by subrogating, the insurance company).\n\nThe partner gets plenty of business with the insurance company, who sends him/her stacks of files at a time.  They probably have a capped fee, meaning the amount the lawyers charge is capped.  The partner will split the files amongst the associates in the team and let them handle it.  The associates will review the file, draft the documents and do the things necessary to deal with the file.  Letters dealing with legal issues, pleadings etc. will be reviewed by the Partner, who will also decide the general strategy of the case.  The partner generally signs off these with the firm name.  \n\nThe associates and partner will delegate work to the parelegals and training lawyers, who may do research or draft simple letters, as well as collate documents.  \n\nDuring all this, everyone will be recording how much time they spent on each task. The partner will look at these at the end of each month (or each bill) and then decide what is reasonable or not.  Referring above, you will recall that associates have a yearly billing target.  This is it.  Of course not all they bill gets \"accepted\".  So in reality, an associate may work 8 hours just to bill 5-6 hours.  The bigger firms tend to ask for 1750 -2100 hours a year.\n\ntl;dr: don't do law oh my god."},

So edgeofdreams covered you mixing up photons and protons. The general idea here is that there are several \"orders\" of particles...we have the super big stuff, like you and I. Were made of tinier stuff called organs, which is made of cells, which is made of various chemicals. Chemicals, individuals ions molecules and atoms. This is where we get to the real base of how things work. Atoms have a number on the periodic table. This is the number of PROTONS it has, protons are a positively charged particle in the center of an atoms nucleus. Now, oribiting a proton is an electron. Electrons are WAY smaller than protons, but carry the opposite charge even though theyre thousandths of the weight of a proton. Now, electrons often interact with other electrons and photons. Photons are the particle that makes light. Well, they're a wave too. This is where you get to quantum physics and its confusing. The photon is massless, which makes it travel so fast that it doesn't get bothered by other stuff other than other elementary particles (electrons, gluons, quarks, etc). This is how it doesnt get interfered with much and we can see it over such a great distance.\n\nTl;dr: Photons are the particle of light.

Do you mean like a 'deja vu' moment, or you suddenly had a memory trigger?\n\nThis is probably the *simplest* explanation I can think of:\n\nWhen your 'remember' something, your brain builds a *physical* pathway across synapses. It's like a big, spongy city of intersecting streets (where each 'street' is a different experience in your life).\n\nBecause it is a 'physical' thing, it can be triggered by multiple events.

Going back to the 'spongy city' scenario, it's like saying you \"visited Lavendar Street\", but it just so happened to intersect with \"Gradma Street\", and so both of them ended up being triggered at once."},

Why do i have to go through the whole process of a 'youtube downloader' that emails it to me, or a chome/IE add-in, or torrenting my porn?\n\nthanks!","answer":"A lot of streaming video, like youtube, is like reading a book by being handed one page at a time, and after each page you tear up that one and throw it away before you get handed the next one. This is efficient for Youtube because they only have to lift one page at a time, not an entire book. The entire book passes through your hands eventually, but actually having the whole book all at once, so you can give it to someone else, takes more effort - you'd have to copy each page as it passes through your hands.

Starting with the debt, the political group called the Golden Dawn, rioting in the streets, and today I read that Greek pharmacies are running out of medical supplies as they're trying to cut costs to keep their business afloat. \n\ntl;dr What happened in the past few decades that landed Greece in its current political and economic situation?","answer":"About ten years ago, France and Germany created the the Eurozone, a free economic zone with a shared currency, the euro.  To get in, you had to show your were an economically responsible country by meeting some pretty high standards.\n\nGreece lied off their ass to get in.  Everyone was pretty sure they were lying, but everyone was super happy about the Eurozone and no one wanted to be a buzzkill, so they let it slide.\n\nGreece started taking out crazy loans, because lenders saw they were in the Eurozone, and figured they must have their act together.  Greece started a spending frenzy, and roads and schools, but also on unnecessary public sector jobs, and did nothing about corruption or tax evasion.  And they kept lying their ass off about the economy.\n\nThings were good in Greece for a while.  But then the bills came due, and it because clear they couldn't pay.  The rest of Europe tried to bail them out, but Greece didn't want to make all the harsh spending cuts it would take to get the budget in order.\n\nNow they are kind of stuck.  No one wants to lend them anymore money, and the can't pay their current expenses, much less what they owe.  Any real solution will require more pain, but they keep voting for politicians who promise fake painless solutions.  What's worse, historically when countries are in this situation, they devalue their currency (and everyone's savings), so their debts are worth less.  But Greece is tied to the euro, with is tied to the French and German economies more than their own, so they are stuck paying their debts back in the expensive Euro.  So now people are unemployed and angry and seeing their livelihood wither away, and are just really mad, and turn to organizations that feed on that anger."},
{"title":"Why does counterfeit hurt the economy, instead of helping it if more money is being added to it?","answer":"Counterfeits don't really hurt the economy, at least not in the scale that it's happening.

I think the current model is that cable providers pay networks for their content and then provide it to you for a ridiculous cost. Then....because they are *%*&amp;^%, they also collect money so companies can attempt brainwash you with ads. If tv networks put their content online, they could directly collect advertising fees, and you could watch their shows without paying for cable. This means more viewers for the network and even more profit for commercials. Before internet, the other model made some sense.....but now it is just stupid.

{"title":"ELI5: How bonds influence equities and vice versa","answer":"Bonds are debt while Equities are assets.\n\nWhen you buy an equity you're buying, well, equity in that company. Like a stock is partial ownership.\n\nWhen you buy a bond on the other hand you're buying that company's debt. A bond is an IOU with interest.\n\nThe two influence each other in a pretty straightforward manner. If a company issues new debt (bonds) the price of it's stock (equities) may go up or down based on investors opinion on the expansion of debt (the stock market is very speculative). It could be good or bad, it depends on the circumstances.\n\nLikewise, the value of, or issuance of equities could affect bond prices in the same way. For example, when a company enters bankruptcy, it has an obligation to pay it's debt first, and usually stockholders get little / nothing."},

","answer":"I'm not an expert on anything remotely related to this, but you piqued my interest, so I looked it up.  \n\nFrom what [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_heart#Psychological_and_neurological_understanding) has to say about it, our emotional and physical responses are all tied up in our brain, so that when we feel something emotionally, sometimes we also feel something in our body.  When we lose love or are hurt by someone we care about, the stress of the situation makes our body react a certain way.  Like stress makes us react in any other situation (e.g. If we are attacked, our body physically prepares to fight or run, or if we are excited we get butterflies, as you mentioned).\n\n[This article](http://www.alternet.org/story/135030/breaking_up_can_literally_break_your_heart) explains the same sort of thing.  Both articles state that it may be that stressful events cause a stress reaction in your body that essentially makes your body work hard to cope with the situation, resulting in physical symptoms from your heart pumping and muscles tightening and generally working in a way that this not normal for baseline function.\n\nFrom personal experience, I notice that the physical feeling I have when I'm in the middle of a big fight with my boyfriend is strikingly similar to the feeling I get when I am having an anxious episode due to a non-romantic stressor like school or work.\n\nI'm sorry if this is too vague or not accurate, but it's what I got from quickly looking it up.

{"title":"What is the difference between a 32 and 64 bit computer?","answer":"There are two things a computer does where the number of bits make a difference. Math, and addressing. When you hear 32 or 64 bit it's often about the PC market where they both use the same amount of bits, but this doesn't have to be the case. Other systems can use different combinations like 64bit match, and 32bit addressing.\n\nMath:\n\nSay 32 bit math is like how you'd add a large number on paper. You start with the 'ones' column, add that together, and maybe carry a value. Then you move to the tens, then to the hundreds, etc. Each time you add the values and the carry value and save the new value plus the new carry.\n\n     1234\n    +5678\n     ====\n\n    1) add 4 + 8     = 12, save 2, carry the 1\n    2) add 3 + 7 + 1 = 11, save 1, carry the 1\n    3) add 2 + 6 + 1 = 9,  save 9, no carry\n    4) add 1 + 5     = 6,  save 6\n\n    Result: 6912, done in 4 operations.\n\nA 64 bit system can add twice a much at once. So now pretend instead of adding the ones column you could add the tens and ones at the same time. Then you'd move on to the hundreds and thousands column.\n\n     1234\n    +5678\n    =====\n\n    1) Add 34 + 78     = 112, save 12, and carry the 1\n    2) Add 12 + 56 + 1 = 69, save 69\n\n    Result: 6912, done in 2 operations.\n\nSo by having twice as many bits means you could calculate this result in half as many operations.\n\nAddressing:\n\nA computer has to ask for values it saved earlier. These are stored in memory, which is really just a bunch of boxes. Imagine a warehouse full of boxes, each has a shelf number and row number to allow someone to find the box.\n\nFirst you have a worker with a small memory, we'll call him thirty-two. He can only remember one number. This is fine if you have one shelf because you tell him the row and off he goes. Even if you add more than one shelf he can still get your box, but you'll first have to tell him what shelf, wait for him to get there, then tell him the row.\n\nThen comes along a new young guy called sixty-four. He can remember both the shelf number and the row number all at one time, making him more efficient to work with when you have more than one shelf. He does have some downsides though. For example if you just have one shelf you still have to tell him that every time.\n\nTo tie this back to actual computers, a shelf holds about 4 billion boxes (about 4G of memory)."},

{"title":"ELI5 Why can you secure the rights to remake movies, or cover songs, but can't rewrite a novel?","answer":"You can. For example, the Nancy Drew books have been rewritten--sometimes only having bits updated so they sound more modern, while other times the entire book was changed, leaving only the title. See, movies and such typically have a large number of people that work on it, and the copyright is held by a corporation, which wants to make money.if they sense they can make more money by selling the rights to remake something, they will often do so. But when creators are motivated chiefly by art rather than money, they show reluctance in allowing anyone to tamper with their work--they believe others can't do it as well as themselves. Since books are almost always written by a sole individual artist, who hoods the copyright, they'll usually recuse rewrites--but they may do some rewriting themselves, which is why there are multiple editions of the same book. When copyrights are held by corporations, such as in the Nancy Drew example above, rewrites are standard.fYI: the Nancy Drew books have as author \"Carolyn Keene.\" but no such person exists. Books were assigned to individual people to write, and the authors were sworn to secrecy, names not revealed. The copyright was owned by the Stratemeyer Syndicate. Other examples are comic books. They're always updating and changing their stories, having new authors retell the same characters' tales again and again."},

{"title":"ELI5: China/Hong Kong history and relations","answer":"Historically, Hong Kong was a regular part of China, just like places like Beijing or Shanghai. In the 19th century, European powers and the US wanted to trade with China more openly than the Chinese government was willing to accept. The British were particularly interested in providing opium, a drug, to the Chinese. The Chinese government tried to prevent this and the general Western trade initiatives, but the West had more firepower and, through threats and open combat, forced the Chinese to accept this trade. Hong Kong was taken by the British as a colonial possession, to facilitate all this enterprise. Under British rule, it grew and became a large financial centre. However, in the late 19th century Britain had made a treaty with China, whereby British rule would last for another 99 years, and then the territory would revert to Chinese rule. Given that China is a communist dictatorship, in the run-up to 1997, when HK was to be handed over to the Chinese, Britain made an arrangement with the Communist Party to maintain HK as a capitalist economy (which wasn't that much trouble to Beijing, given China itself is transitioning to something resembling capitalism), as well as a democratic system (which it has had more trouble adhering to).\n\nSo, HK is today a \"Special Administrative Region\" of the People's Republic of China. It has its own currency, the HK dollar, which is much less controlled by Beijing than the mainland yuan. It has its own government, with part of the legislature being directly elected. In contrast to the system of internal passports used in the mainland (to regulate the mass inflow of poor people from the rural areas to the big cities), people from HK have their own passport, which is accepted worldwide in an unrelated way to the mainland passport - so, HK citizens might get visa-free travel to places where mainlanders need visas.\n\nBasically, this all also applies to Macau, except that you replace Britain by Portugal, the 1997 date of return of control by 1999 and that Macau is not nearly as important a financial centre as Hong Kong. Oh, and the history of the Portuguese in China goes much farther back than most of the Western powers. But, apart from that, Macau (which isn't too far from Hong Kong, both lying on the Pearl River Delta, in the province of Guangdong) is a sort of a minor Hong Kong. With casinos."},

There's not really a right answer.\n\n\"Paw\" might have been used by the author to emphasize the grotesque, inhuman characteristics of the object.

Right now the most popular one is Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM).  It basically works like an inkjet printer.  Inkjet printers will print one line on a pass. FDM 3D printers will print one contour or cross-section on a pass. There is a nozzle that melted plastic is squeezed through to produce your 3D model. It stacks layer by layer until your part is complete. If your part is somewhat complex and has overhangs or holes, the 3D printer will also supply a disposable support material to help prop up your part while it's being printed.  "},
{"title":"ELI5 Why my hands get hot as hell as soon as I bring them out of the snow into a warmer environment","question_detail":"Also, is there any special name for this phenomenon?\n\nHow can you prevent this feeling or stop it?","answer":"Your hands aren't getting hot, they're actually returning to normal temperature after being quite cold. It just *feels* hot to you. It may also feel painful, tingly or achey.\n\nThis phenomenon is called \"the hot aches\" or the \"screaming barfies\" among those who climb mountains and ice walls. It's one of the very early stages of frostbite. What's happening is that your body says, \"holy CRAP it's cold, we might die here, send all the warm blood to the core!\" The blood vessels in your extremities (hands, toes, ears, nose) start to constrict (get smaller) reducing the blood flow to these parts. Less blood flow means less heat, and also less movement.\n\nYour body does this because it \"knows\" that you can survive without a few fingers and toes, but not without a warm, beating heart.\n\nWhen you warm up again, your body relaxes and allows blood to move more freely to your extremities. Unfortunately, the sudden rise in temperature (and feeling) makes your hands do the ouchy-ouchy dance.\n\nStuff you can do to help prevent the screaming barfies:\n\n- Increase your circulation by moving your whole body more-- this applies in the short term as well as the long term (exercise!)\n\n- rub your forearms and hands frequently to try to keep the blood moving and the blood vessels open\n\n- Obviously, gloves help, but mittens are better because they keep your fingers together, allowing them to share heat\n\n- Glove liners can help too\n\n- If you are a person that is consistently cold, talk to your doctor about anemia and/or circulation \n\n- Use cheap chemical handwarmer pouches available pretty much anywhere.

It very rarely refers to the lifetime of the felon, normally thats referred to as \"Natural Life\", and its very uncommon in first world countries. Life sentences are nominally reserved for violent crimes, I'm fairly certain few, if any, white collar criminals receive life sentences. A major discerning factor for receiving a life sentence is that the felon is considered a svere enough threat to society to warrant being removed for the protection of citizens, this isn't the main distinguishing feature of this punishment but its a point of the sentence."},

Sight is required for pretty much everything we do. The blinking reflex allows your body to protect the eyes to a certain extent with the eyelid from anything that might damage such an important body part. \n\nThe Army has recently had trouble with soldiers losing eye sight while moving through wooded areas at night. While moving, something as simple as a twig can hit their eye and is capable of causing blindness. The Army now uses glasses/goggles whenever conducting such a movement to prevent this loss. The reflex helps to prevent such an occurrence in the daylight."},

{"title":"ELI5 The differences between the differences between each country's sign languages.","question_detail":"How come, for example, there's American and British sign language?  How much does a language using hand-movement symbols vary across written languages?","answer":"Sign languages aren't a way of \"speaking English with your hands\". They are completely separate languages, which arise and develop independently of the spoken language used in the same area. Consequently, their grammar and vocabulary are based on their own rules regarding hand shape, position, and movement, as well as facial expressions.\n\nSo, in much the same way that the sound of the word \"say\" means \"I know\" in Portuguese and \"you are\" in Italian, a gesture of moving your hand up and down with the palm towards you could mean \"cake\" in American Sign Language while it means \"pig\" in British Sign Language. (I don't know any actual sign languages, this example is totally made up. The one about spoken languages is real.)\n\nIn other words, there isn't anything particularly \"say-ish\" about the sequence of sounds [sej].

{"title":"So I think I understand why North Korea wants the shit freed out of them.

But I have little understanding of war/politics, and am curious to what will really happen if they attack South Korea or the United States. \n\n\nObviously we [unfortunately] wouldn't literally nuke the shit of them I would think, so what happens? Another long drawn out war, or would it end quickly, and how so?","answer":"There is a real chance that we would use at least a few nukes.  The stated purpose of nuclear weapons, according to US policy, is to deter the use of other people using nuclear weapons.  Politically speaking, we might actually *have to* use nukes if DPRK does, because if we don't it might appear that we're unwilling to use nukes at all, defeating the point of a \"nuclear deterrent\".  So yeah, we might see a nuke dropped on Pyongyang, and it would be politically difficult to condemn it if DPRK uses nukes first.  \n\nMilitarily speaking, North Korea doesn't have much of a chance.  At best, they can get a good first strike against the ROK, but despite their relatively large army, they really don't have the ability to keep them supplied.  Analysts expect them to be completely unable to use vehicles maybe two weeks into the war, after which they have only what their infantry can carry on their backs.  There might also be some light shelling of the northern part of Seoul, but civilian deaths from a non-wmd attack are expected to be in the 10,000's range.  And of course, firing artillery is really easy to spot, and will be quickly destroyed.  \n\nEventually, we see something similar to what happened in Iraq.  The regime will be removed in a matter of months, Obama will appear on an aircraft carrier saying \"mission accomplished\", and then we have a long, probably bloody occupation.  The difference is that the world will love us for this one, and ROK will be doing most of the grunt work.  \n"},

I feel like a real idiot now. Sorry :( ","answer":"First of all, I really like the idea of Spore.  It was inspired by the IBM film *[Powers of Ten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0)* [9:01], which is worth a watch, if you didn't see it in school.  The idea is that at each level of evolution you are zooming out by another power, so you would really get an idea of the scale of the universe.\n\nUnfortunately, the game had a disjointed feel that made it play like a series of mini-games topped with a space RTS.  This wasn't really how the game was marketed, and it was massively hyped for years before release, so fans were mostly disappointed.  \n\nAnother potential factor is that EA decided to encumber Spore with aggressive DRM, which has been accused of containing malware.  EA also limited the number of times the game could be installed.  As a result, many fans decided to download the cracked version (which came with the DRM removed) in protest.  This caused the TorrentFreak website to name Spore as *Most pirated video game of 2008*.  Unfortunately, EA did not learn their lesson and chose to employ an even more aggressive form of 'always-on' DRM with Simcity (presumably because retina scans and DNA tests were unavailable) which has resulted in possibly the worst video game launch in history.\n\nIn a way, Spore was the last game of its kind. The principle behind Spore was that players would create content for each other that was freely distributed through EA's servers.  Today, it is far more profitable for a game company to release a half-finished game, prevent user-created content and mods and sell the rest of it piecemeal through micro-transactions and DLC."},
{"title":"ELI5: What does a cinematographer do vs a director or producer?","question_detail":"I know they shoot some of the stills in marketing products, but I'm assuming they do a lot more than that based on the fact that there is a category at The Oscars for them. ","answer":"Cinematography is the camera work.  Stuff like lighting, cameras, basically just how to capture the image the way it is supposed to be captured.  A director decides what it should look like.  They decide how to turn the text on the script into pictures, then tell the cinematographer what it needs to look like.  A producer oversees pretty much everything.  They usually have to find to funding, choose the director, script, etc.  It depends a lot on the movie, though.  Some directors are very hands on with cinematography, sometimes the producer does the casting and sometimes it is the director (usually a bit of both).  Sometimes a producer can fire a director, but sometimes they can't (it would be pretty hard for a producer to fire someone like Quentin Tarantino).  \n\nThere is also what is called an *auteur*.  That is a filmmaker, usually a director, who's personal influence is so great that the movie is considered theirs, like Quentin Tarantino.  They might also write the script, or produce, or take on other important tasks.  They pretty much always choose the script.  Compare this to how something like the new Star Wars movie is made: Disney, the company, want to make a movie, so they hire a producer who then hires scriptwriters, a director, a cast, etc, and what they end up with will be a Star Wars movie made by Disney with no one person being considered the creator.

{"title":"ELI5: Bridge, Pinocle, Hearts, and other \"bidding\" type card games","question_detail":"I have tried wrapping my head around them again and again and I'm just flat out lost.","answer":"While they are all trick taking games, only bridge and pinochle have bidding.\n\nIn trick taking games, one player *leads*, by playing a card, and everyone else must play one card in turn.  The player with the \"best\" card takes all the cards, winning the *trick*.  \"Best\" varies from game to game, and it is not always advantageous to win a trick.\n\nIn bridge and pinochle, there is also a *bidding* phase, called the *auction*.  Players take turns bidding how many tricks they think they can take.  Players can raise the bid or pass, and bidding stops when everyone but the high bidder has passed.  The high bidder must then take that many tricks, or he loses.\n\nTo make this more complicated, bridge and pinochle are often played with teams of two, and they much combine to make the bid.  And since they aren't allowed to communicate what is in their hands, the lower bids are often used as a sort of code to feel each other out.  You might bid \"1 Heart\" if you have a lot of hearts.  Your partner might counter with \"3 Spades\", to let you know he has spades instead, and they are pretty good spades.  There is no official way to do this, and different partners have different systems."},

{"title":"ELI5: What are mortgage bonds? ","question_detail":"How can debt be traded, invested in, used for capital gain? I don't understand. What does it mean when mortgages are pooled? ","answer":"So here is the general idea. When a bank makes a mortgage loan it now has an agreement with the borrower that the borrower will pay the money back over a certain period of time, and with a certain interest rate. Now loaning, say 200k to one person for a house is fairly risky, and most investors wouldnât want so many eggs in one basket. So someone had the idea to pool a bunch of mortgages together to create a diversified group of mortgages. The idea being that while the chance of any one person not paying their mortgage is a substantial risk, odds are that only a small number of people in this pool would actually default on their mortgage, making the pool of mortgages a much safer investment than a single mortgage. Now that they had this pool of mortgages they sold of pieces of the pool to smaller investors. By buying say 1% of this pool, you were entitled to receive 1% of the proceeds that it generated. The rating agencies looked at these mortgage pools, agreed that they were nice diversified investments and gave them very high ratings. Now who invested in these pools? Well in most cases it wasnât directly by individual investors, but maybe a pension fund invested in it. People are always looking for safe ways to earn a high interest rate on their money. Of course in hindsight, the big mistake that was made, as is often the case in crashes, was underestimating the correlation of mortgage default risk. People failed to realized that if the housing market turned, suddenly many people would be defaulting all at the same time."},
{"title":"ELI5: Why are there different glasses for different drinks, and why does a beer glass make it taste any better?

What i am neerding about is beer, some novices say that the different kinds of glasses are just a marketing scheme (this is generally the same kind of people that put ice in the whiskey) but its bullshit. The glass is all about how the beer flows in to your mouth and the difference it makes for your taste experience, first of you have the shape of the glass, it directs how the beer will flow out of the glass, making it flow either slow with a goblet, tulip or a sniffer or fast with a pokal, tumbler or a stein all with different purposes. Then you have the glass itself, the material that is, it directs firstly how the beer behaves when you pour it and how it behaves sitting in the glass and flowing through it. Then there is the edge of the glass, it directs how the beer behaves when flowing into you mouth, if it should be smooth or a bit more violently with a little bump.

They added the regional stuff in SimCity 5 so you can interact with other people's cities but most people don't care about that or want it (or at least don't want it forced on them) and by most accounts it doesn't add much to game anyway (haven't played it myself).\n\nPeople want to be connected in WoW, people don't want to be forced to be connected when all they want to do is build their city on their own, especially when it's preventing them from doing that in the first place because they couldn't even play the game they bought due to server issues."},
{"title":"ELI5: What's a great method to build a very strong habit for studying more (or something you procrastinate on.)?","answer":"Make a schedule (and follow it).

I finished one of my tests and discovered that I had been quite successful with my cloth.

How does regulation, in general, work?\n\n","answer":"Regulation is not as speisfic as you are taking about.  Normaly there are ceryan kind of things you cannot do.  As long as your new product does not violate any of the cannot items, then your good to go.  however if the government decides that they want to, they might add something your produict does to the cannot do list.  In that case your fucked.\n\nLets say you invent some kind of new food.  There are all kinds of rules about the kinds of things you can't encourage people to eat. And all kinds of rules about how you need to label your package.  but as long as your product does not have anything in the \"no\" list then your good to go.\n\nIf it turns out to make people sick, it will likely be added to the list of things that you can't put in food.

{"title":"ELI5: What is the deal with this Sim City game? Why is there such a controversy?","answer":"Let's say you wanted to buy the coolest new toy car from the same brand that's been making your favourite toy car for years. This time though, they insist that you play with it at the toy store. They say it's so you can become friends with the other kids and play with your toys together, and they also insist that you CAN'T play with it at home by yourself because it's not designed like that. The main problem was that, at the beginning, there wasn't enough space in the toy store for everyone to play with the cars, so people started to get upset because all they wanted to do was play with the cars. \n\n[Today though, somebody started playing with their car at home, and showed that it worked almost perfectly fine, and now everyone's even angrier at the company because they said that you couldn't!](http://www.geek.com/articles/games/modder-proves-simcity-can-run-offline-indefinitely-20130314/)"},

I would judge that the midget has less chance of winning then the giant, say the midget has a 10% chance of winning, so the giant has a 90% chance of winning.\n\nI want to make money when taking bets, so a bet on the giant winning will pay less than a bet on the midget.\n\nThe odds for the midget would be 1:9.\n\nThe odds for the giant would be 9:1.\n\nFor every 1 dollar I bet on the midget, I get 9 dollars if it wins. If I bet 1 dollar on the midget, I would get 9$+the original 1$.=10$.\n\nFor every 9 dollars I bet on the giant, I would get 1 dollar if he wins. Betting on the giant gives be 1$+the original 9$=10$.\n\n---\n\nI can win more money by betting on the midget, but that's because there's a higher chance it'll lose.

That applies to almost every other country in the world.\n\nWhy is that? Aren't we \"pro-globalization\"? Are there any *concrete* reasons?","answer":"In order for you to live somewhere, you need to buy a house (or rent, but the principle is the same).\n\nTo buy a house, you need to find someone who will sell you a house.\n\nHouses are expensive, so you'll probably only get one if you can get a loan.\n\nA person/bank will only loan you money if they think you can pay it back.\n\nThe best way to show you can pay back the loan (or pay rent) is to have a job, or a job offer. \n\nIf you don't have that, then there's a big risk you can't pay back the money, so you can't get a loan so you can't get anyone to sell a place to live to you."},
{"title":"ELI5: What peak oil does to oil prices","answer":"Peak oil doesn't effect oil prices, peak oil is the result of oil prices.\n\nPeak oil is when the rate of production of oil is at a maximum.\n\nBasic microeconomics applies, so as supply decreases, prices will increase.\n\nPrices will continue to increase as supply decreases, but it doesn't matter when 'peak oil' happens, as prices are determined by supply, not the rate of production.\n\n---\n\nAs price increases, demand will decrease, which will effect production.

{"title":"ELI5 why girls that have daddy issues are stereotyped as being easy.","answer":"We all tend to emulate our parents and the dynamics between them as we grow up.  It's not like this for everybody but often patterns will repeat generation after generation.\n\nLets say dad is verbally or physically abusive to mom and spends a lot of time away from home.  Daughters in this environment tend to become much like their mother and are attracted to deadbeat abusive D-bags.  Sons in this environment tend to grow up and be abusive, distant D-bags.  Why?  Well, because when your a kid whatever is going on around you is perceived as \"normal\" and as you get older you have a tendency to seek out this sort of \"normal\" thing.\n\nSo another example; lets say dad divorced a long time ago and the daughter never knew her biological father, only boyfriends mom has had over the years while growing up.  They're not abusive necessarily but mom tends to break up with them after a while and move onto another.  The daughter will emulate this behavior, dating boyfriends for a while but having a hard time connecting to them for whatever reasons the mother has.  A son in this household will be guy kind of guy who goes around dating a lot of women with little remorse for leaving them behind, even if they get the pregnant.\n\nSource:  Some life experience, but mostly listening to a shitload of LoveLine with Adam Carolla and Dr. Drew back in the 90s."},

","answer":"I just read about this topic and there is no clear genetic explanation. But almost every society, right handed people outnumber left handed people. This led to cultural biases against lefties. In many cultures (especially pre-toilet paper), the left was used to clean yourself after defacating. This is why it's seen as unclean to eat with it. Also, left handed children are discouraged from using this hand to write with and thus grow up as right handed. "},
{"title":"ELI5: Why my UPS deliveries have such varied times","question_detail":"For example, a package coming from the same place on the same day of the week may be delivered to me at 1pm, 3pm, 5pm, 8pm etc., and this is even the same driver. It absolutely blows my mind.","answer":"UPS delivery trucks do not drive set routes, like mail trucks do. Each day, each truck is loaded with the packages to be delivered that day, and a whole new route is computed to make those deliveries in the shortest time and over the shortest distance. They do all sorts of neat route-optimization, like trying to plan routes so only right-hand turns are required, in order to make things go faster (you usually don't have to wait at red lights to make a right turn) and to make things safer (statistically, you're much more likely to get into a traffic accident while making a left turn).\n\nSo you don't get deliveries at the same time every day because every truck drives a wholly unique route every day."},

{"title":"ELI5: How were movies in the early 1900's edited?","answer":"They used (use, it's still done) a special film projector with a small screen. You can watch the film and stop it at specific points. The bulb used to project the film into the screen is very dim, so you don't melt the film like you would if you stopped a regular projector. \n\nWhen they find the last part of a scene, they use a blade to physically cut the film. Then you use the same method to find the beginning of the next scene. It's cut from its original roll, and taped using clear tape onto the end of the last scene.\n\nContinue scene by scene until you have a complete movie. \n\nEditors would overlap some of the frames to fade between scenes. \n\nJust like now. Typically editors don't actually work from the start of the movie to the end. They start by turning takes into scenes, then edit scenes into a completed movie. \n"},

{"title":"ELI5: why does it feel like I am traveling really slow in an airplane when really we are flying at speeds close to 900 km/h?","answer":"Because of Newton's First Law of Motion. It feels like you're traveling slow or not traveling at all because you're moving at a constant speed. Objects moving at a constant speed or not moving at all aren't accelerating so there's no force acting upon them to make them move any faster. There ARE forces acting on them but the NET force is 0. So being at rest before take off and mid flight (excluding turbulence) come out feeling the same. It's only when you have a change in speed (which is the definition of acceleration) when you feel the difference."},
{"title":"ELI5: It seems the word \"guy\" refers to a male person. But the word \"guys\" refers to people of either sex. Why is that?","answer":"I'd say it has to do with the lack of grammatical number distinction with using the word *you*. When you say *you*, you sometimes don't know whether that refers to a single person or a group. So a few ways arise of addressing the need speakers feel to specify they're referring to more than one person. Ways such as *yous* or *y'all* sound too dialectal to most people, while *you guys* apparently doesn't. Since it is used to all-male groups, mixed ones and even all-female ones, the plural \"guys\" extends to mixed and all-female groups even in contexts other than the original *you guys* expression."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why does everyone hate EA?","question_detail":"I've seen countless posts bashing EA Games. What did they do to deserve all the ridicule?","answer":"EA has changed how they create and sell video games over the last number of years.  These changes have upset a large number of people, especially those that have liked EA for a very long time.  In no particular order, here's a few of them:\n\n**1)  Planned obsolescence.**  This means that even before a game is released, EA has already planned its end.  The moment you pick up that shiny new game and bring it home, they're already working on the next version.  A great example of this are the yearly EA Sports games.  Who wants to play NHL 2012 when you can wait a month to play NHL 2013?  Even then, NHL 2014 is right around the corner!  While a not a bad thing, many people are used to buying games that they can play for many years down the road.  This is no longer the case.\n\n**2) Sell the brand, not the game.**  This means EA relies on their popular brands to sell their games instead of creating new, genuinely unique titles.  A good example of this is Need For Speed.  People know this brand and buy the latest game expecting it to be a new version of a great racing game they remember playing years ago.  When they play it, they realise it doesn't contain anything that made that game so popular.  People are upset because they feel EA quickly rushed together a new game (see above) and just slapped a popular brand on it to make sure it sells.\n\n**3) Downloadable content (DLC).**  This is where you can pay additional money to buy additional content for the game.  This content could be anything from a new color of hairstyle for your character that simply looks cool to a new gun that actually gives you an advantage.  DLC is common these days and not something only done by EA.  DLC upsets a lot of people as they feel this content should just be included with the game when you buy it.\n\n**4) Digital Rights Management (DRM).**  DRM is a technology designed to prevent people from stealing games and playing them without paying for it.  EA has implemented some DRM in their titles recently that have gone to such great lengths to prevent theft that the people who actually bought the game are unable to play the game!  When they asked for their money back, they where told no!  So now EA has their money, they have a game they can't play and this makes people very upset."},

{"title":"ELI5:How is it possible that we can play online games with almost no delay whatsoever?","answer":"The two biggest reasons are assumptions and estimations. Let me explain.\n\nThere are two main ways two computers on a network can talk to each other - TCP, and UDP. With TCP everything that is sent should be acknowledged by the other end - if you send a message, the receiver sends a response. This is a little inefficient because for everything sent, you pay twice the amount of time it took for the message to travel (the latency), but it is more reliable. UDP is \"fire and forget\", where the sender fires the message off and assumes the other end received it. Sometimes not all the data doesn't make it to the other end but at the benefit where the overall latency is better because the sender doesn't have to wait around to see the response before sending more.\n\nOnline games more or less use UDP for everything when it comes to sending real time information between players and the programmers for the games build ways to try and combat the problems where messages (err, packets as they are known as) disappeared somewhere along the way.\n\nThere's another problem. The amount of time it takes for one player or a server to send data somewhere can vary a lot. The time it takes for some computers to process data varies, the clocks they use to keep hold of time might drift too. All of these things happen, but *for as long as there isn't more than about 20 milliseconds (or 1/50 of a second) of difference between the input you put in and the visual response you receive, you won't notice it*. A lot of games makes estimations on where you are moving and where you might be positioned in the map at a given time, taking into consideration how long it takes on average for data to leave you to reach the server and other factors. If you move too fast, the connection and the algorithms used to predict this might not keep up."},

{"title":"Eli5: March Madness","question_detail":"Don't know anything about basketball....lets talk","answer":"The NCAA is the governing body for college men's basketball.  All of the Division 1 (the highest level of college basketball) teams are divided into conferences.  During the regular season from October to March teams compete within their conference, as well as play several teams from other conferences.  At the end of the year, each conference has a tournament.  If a team wins they get an automatic spot in the national tournament.  \n\nThe NCAA tournament is 68 teams and single elimination.  The Selection Committee chooses the best teams (along with the conference winners) to compete each year.  The first day of games is the 8 worst teams playing for the last 4 spots in the 64-team bracket.  The second round of games is usually very exciting because there are usually a lot of upsets where lower ranked teams will beat better teams.  From then on it's usually the best 16 teams in the country playing each other, but every once in a while a Cinderella team will make a run to the later rounds.\n\nThe great thing about March Madness is that basically any team can win in a single game situation.  For example last year 2 of the best teams in the country both lost in the first round.  Also, you also get to watch great teams play.  Last year's Final Four game of Kentucky vs Louisville came down to the last minute and was one of the best games all year.  You got to watch 2 of the best teams, who were huge rivals, play a rematch game from earlier in the year for a spot in the championship game."},

{"title":"ELI5: Scapy, and what exactly are packets?","answer":"TL;DR packets are small amounts of information. \n\nBasically this all started with the telegram and the british navy. \n\nBack in the day if you want to transmit a signal you had to have an active connection, you would physically connect wires between point A and point B and then transmit what ever you say.\n\nNow sooner or later (actually around 150 years, don't quote me on that number its not referenced) we came up with the idea of packet switching. This is to break a signal down into smaller parts, so you can transmit each one individually, then put it back together once they all reach the the indented target.\n\nIn short. \n\nThe old method you'd want to talk to say New york from berlin. So you'd have to get a single connection, one wire from your office in new york, to your buddy in berlin. Once you get everyone along the way to set up each switch (literally), then you transmit. \n\nThe packet system is you send your message, then its broken up into lets say 5 second intervals for simplicity sake. Each 5 second interval is transmitted together, but the connections can be changed while the message is in route, and since you don't need a direct connection it can be interrupted by ever other person trying to talk without causing your message to suffer.\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: why does it hurt in my testicles when I cough really hard? ","question_detail":"I know I'm not the only one that this happens to, but sometimes when a gent caught very hard he will feel a pain in his testicle region. Can anyone she's some light on how these two events are related? ","answer":"Disclaimer: I'm not a doctor.  If it really worries you, that's basis enough to see a doctor.\n\nThat said, what you're feeling might be normal.  Think about what you're doing when you cough.  Before you actually let the cough out, you're performing a maneuver that only doctors and fighter pilots will know the technical term for - a \"valsalva.\"  A valsalva is just like bearing down when trying to poop - you're trying really hard to push your breath out against a closed throat.\n\nWhat does that do?  It creates pressure in your abdomen.  So why might this make your testicles hurt?  Because the nerves that supply feeling to your testicles run along a canal called the [spermatic cord,](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zVujiIU9-u4/R-Kyc5CyMxI/AAAAAAAAABM/VPxPyuLyStI/s320/inguinal+hernia.jpg) which runs from your testicles up through an opening called the superficial inguinal ring.  Valsalva-ing can squeeze this ring and put a lot of pressure on your spermatic cord, which can create pain.  That's what smooshing nerves does.  \n\nYou can do a mini-experiment on yourself.  With your palm facing you, tap the center of your wrist where your tendons enter your hand.  You can feel tingling in your thumb, index, and middle fingers.  That's because the nerve that supplies those fingers runs right in the middle of your wrist.  If you would smash that nerve hard, you would feel pain there.  Anyone with carpal tunnel knows how that feels.\n\nYou can also have referred pain, too.  Pain from your back and kidneys can manifest itself in your testicles because the nerves that supply them come from the same place on your spine.  So if your have an injured back or kidneys, sometimes your testicles hurt, and coughing might make it worse.  If this isn't a new development, though, I wouldn't worry about it.\n\nI wouldn't keep coughing hard, though.  That's a great way to get yourself an inguinal hernia, which is when some of your guts push through into your scrotum - it's the most common type of hernia in men.  If you're only feeling the pain on one side... well, you might already have one and should *definitely* see your doc.  It's what they check for when they ask you to \"turn and cough.\""},

{"title":"ELI5: How online poker software works in comparison to a real life game","question_detail":"Specifically how the software determines what cards people get and is it random or predetermined scenarios?","answer":"the shuffler is almost certainly using a randomly seeded pseudo-random number generator.\n\na pseudo-random number generator is a piece of software that gives digits from a sequence of numbers in such a way that knowledge of previous digits seen does not assist in predicting future digits produced. BUT its not perfect, so if you knew the exact algorithm and the exact starting point (the seed) and the exact sequence so far you might be able to predict the next number.\n\nthe solution to this imperfection is to observe something actually random in the world (like random errors that arise in computer network traffic) and use that real world randomness to generate a seed for the pseudo-random number generator. as long as you re-seed the generator regularly it will be impossible to predict the next digit."},
{"title":"ELI5: What would it be like to have no sense of time?","question_detail":"Aka what is the passage of time feel like to a dog?","answer":"Well, in order to \"feel\" or \"measure\" time, you need to have something that repeats. For example, the sun is guaranteed to rise in the morning, every morning. You can then base the sun rise as a way to accurately measure how long things are (to a degree). You can then *expand* your measurement of time based on the sun to a \"day\" when the sun is up, and a \"night\" when the moon is up, and count how many sunrises it takes until the leaves fall off the trees, when the snow falls, when it melts and the flowers grow, when sun grows hot and the air becomes humid. We've since grown beyond this to more accurate and scientific ways to measure time.\n\nIn a universe where nothing would repeat itself or is predictable, 1-We wouldn't have evolved to this state in the first place 2- You would have no stimuli to interact with (because a universe like this is completely thrown up to chance, and it's unlikely you'll just so happen to get, say, a ball to throw around) 3- In order to fully assure there would be no measurable time, there would be no matter 4-And as far as an inhabitant of this universe is concerned, there would **be no such thing as time.**"},

The sensory data goes to your consciousness where you experience things in real time, and they also go to your memory to be stored. The 'glitch in the matrix' is when traffic/misfiring lets the input reach your memory before your consciousness by a few micro/milliseconds. By the time you experience it, it's already in your memory. You've remembered it before it happened (by your point of view)."},

I'm just wondering how a CD is burned. How is that different from burning CD Rewritable?  Thank you!","answer":"The surface of a CD has one long spiral track on it, much like a vinyl record, albeit on a much, much smaller scale.\n\nThis track is then broken up into millions of small \"blocks\".\n\nAs you already know, a CD is digital (data made up of a sequence of only 1's and 0's). A CD stores either a 1 or a 0 in each of these blocks.\n\nTo represent a 1 or 0 on a CD, there are flat reflective areas and non-reflective bumps. A flat reflective area represents a 1, while a non-reflective bump represents a 0.\n\nThe CD drive shines a laser at the surface of the CD and can detect the reflective areas and the bumps by the amount of laser light they reflect.\n\nIn a normal CD, you have a plastic layer covered with a reflective aluminum or gold layer. In a CDR, you have a plastic layer, a transparent dye layer and a reflective layer. On a new CDR, the entire surface of the disc is reflective, so the laser will shine through the dye and reflect off the reflective layer.\n\nWhen writing data to a new CDR, the writing laser heats this dye up to a given temperature. This changes the transparency of this block. By making a block opaque (not transparent), this represents a non-reflective bump (and therefor a digital 0). Due to the nature of this dye, it can only be changed once, so once changed, it cannot be changed back.\n\nIn a CDRW, the principle of a dye layer is the same. But rather than only being able to change the transparency of the dye once, the dye can be heated to another set temperature to make it clear again. So by varying the power of the laser (and therefore temperature you heat the dye to), you can change the dyes transparency between transparent and opaque, adding or removing the digital 0's was many times as you wish."},

It was the first computer to bridge the gap between home and business use...or at least, it was the first to have the marketing muscle of IBM behind it to tell you that was the case.\n\nTheir computer needed an operating system, so they hired Microsoft to provide it.

First, IBM won the PC wars, and because the dominant PC platform.  Second, since IBM PCs were made with a lot of off the shelf parts, and since the OS was available from Microsoft, it was very easy for other vendors to make PC clones.  In fact, a large part of the reason IBM \"won\" the PC wars was because of all the cheap clones on the market.\n\nThe end result was IBM compatibles became the standard, and most all of them had a Mircosoft OS running on them.

Some go completely black between drawing images. Some draw over what was already there. Some have to \"clear\" each pixel when drawing.  All of these create different effects. \n\nThis is why if you see video cameras recording TV shows (especially older large tube TVs) you'll see a line in the screen slowly moving down. This is because the video camera is picking up the screen refreshing, but you're not. Note you'll only see this if the refresh rate and the recording frame rate are out of sync.\n\nNote this is different than FPS or frames per second. Generally FPS refers to how fast software can decode (or render) a scene. "},

So for this motor, if you apply 10 V, the no load speed will be 3800 RPM and if you apply 30 V, the no load speed will be 11400 RPM.

The best way to get rid of it is doing something like the master cleanse or any juice fast/colon cleanse really. \n\nTotally serious\n\nToo many carbs cause an insulin spike which causes more oil on our skin.   Then the quick drop in blood sugar causes hormones called androgens to be released which causes a craving for more sugar/carbs.  Androgens also cause more oil to be made on our skin.  Cleanses help our body reset so to speak and clear the years of build up out of our bodies.  I can see this on myself now; my wife and I are spending a few weeks at my parent's house and I'm seeing breakouts from the carb heavy meals they like to prepare.  I used to have really bad acne that got worse when I hit my twenties.

{"title":"ELI% why I can \"hear the ocean\" when I put my ear up to a bottle","answer":"The *most likely* explanation is that the shell acts as a \"loud speaker\", capturing all the ambient noise around you, and reflecting back it straight into your ear.\n\nNormally, a lot of that noise goes straight past you (since your ears are relatively flat), so it becomes much more noticeable when it's focused.

{"title":"ELI5: Why water can evaporate at room temperature, but not freeze at room temperature.","question_detail":"I recently saw a post asking why water can evaporate at room temperature, so I figured I'd extend the question further because of my own curiosity.","answer":"Each substance has a single temperature at which it is possible for it to be a solid, a liquid, AND a gas. (Ignoring the effect of pressure, for simplicity.) There is not a big temperature range in which all 3 states can occur. This is called its [triple point](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_point).\n\nThe triple-point of water is 0.01 degrees C. That means that at this temperature, it can take the form of ice, liquid water, or water vapour. But only at this one temperature.\n\nSince water can take the form of either water vapour or liquid water at room temperature, and room temperature is not the triple-point of water, it can't also take a third form at that temperature.\n\nAt temperatures a little above its triple-point (ie. room temperature), water can be either a liquid or a gas.

I don't think there is a single definitive answer, but many introverts have heightened senses--kinda like if the volume was turned up on, well, pretty much everything. So basically they will experience overstimulation during social events that appeal more to extroverts, such meeting new people in a crowded bar. Conversely, social events that might appeal more to introverts, such as a one-on-one with an old friend in a comfortable environment, might be understimulating to an extrovert.\n\nOf course, most of us are in the middle somewhere; this is not striclty an either/or thing.

{"title":"ELI5:Why has dental technology not come up with something better than flossing?","question_detail":"Besides that flossing is gross and you have to contort into stupid positions,  it seems as if in 2013 something better would be invented.  Even flossers and water picks are deemed not as effective.  Why is dragging thread through our teeth still the \"gold standard\"?","answer":"Since no one 'in the know' has responded and this post is a day old:\n\n\nMy opinion is that there's a huge mess with the retail dental sector. The products in the stores and dental advice seem to completely fall short of our potential for oral hygiene. \n\n\nI think what causes this is a complex system which has reached an unfortunate equilibrium. Basically, at some point research and development was done and basic chemicals like flouride and mint flavouring etc were thrown together and toothpaste was made. There would have been some studies done which show dental hygiene increase with use of the product.\n\n\nThen at some point the usual thing happened. Competition got involved and the market became a little bit of a monopoly. So we have about half a dozen 'brands' which all 'compete' for your custom. \n\n\nToothpaste is essentially, fluoride and flavouring. You have fluoride in your water and diet anyway but the act of brushing really does well to dislodge food and bacteria from the teeth - doing it with a chemical makes sense. This is because just brushing alone kind of tumbles up all the bacteria but doesn't remove it.\n\n\nBut the dental giants want you to keep buying new and expensive products. This is because they need to continue researching and developing better products - and to do that they need your money to invest. So, they may change the bottle, the taste add some chemical that had one or two studies (which they usually funded) to show it's better at fresher breath or less plaque etc. They will rebrand the same product 'for kids' or 'for smokers' or 'for whitenening' or 'for old teeth'.\n\n\nEach time one competitor does this, the rest *need to* incase people believe that competitor and think \"say.. colgate don't have a smokers tooth paste, but listerine do, so I'l go with them\". \n\n\nSo much focus is spent on this circle jerk of squeezing money from the consumer and winning petty fights over the competition that no real progress is being made. In fact, well before tooth brushes or toothpaste the early humans had quite perfect teeth well into old a age. While that statement has a huge amount of different variables like increased mortality and hugely different diets - it goes to show - just how disappointing the sector is."},

I'm just wondering about general things like, is the actors pay included in the budget, do they get more if the film makes a lot of monies? If the movie flunks, who really looses? ","answer":"Incredibly simplified but here you go\n\nBuying the rights to the movie or script, you find a s story you like, well your going to have to cough up a few million to get the author to hand it over.\n\nSalaries of workers, cast and crew but increasingly Movie stars are being given a % of the total money taken in by the film instead of a cheque for a couple of million like the old days. but that depends on who has the bigger bargaining power. For example Johnny Depp made $60 million from the last POTC movie because without him that franchise is dead, but a movie like new star wars the actor has less bargaining power as the story will draw crowds rather than the actor. But apart from the actors this is still a huge cost, you have to cover the pay for the Director/Producer/Cinematographer and then the regular folk on set like grips and costume designers.\n \nCost of location renting, need to shoot in the empire state or statue of liberty? that all costs money to close the location and bring in police, provide food and accommodation for the cast and crew you bring. Or maybe you are shooting is a remote location, well as long as you are there you have to pay for food etc to be brought in.\n\nCost of marketing, you have a movie that you want the world to see, well you are going to need to spend millions letting the world know about it. For example Spiderman had a $200 million budget but still needed to spend another $75 to market it around the world.\n\nHow is it Financed?\n\nStudio provides the funds ie Sony/WB/Disney/Fox\n\nOr Independently financed films\n\nWell I've had some firsthand experience with this, at any time there are thousands of movies that need financing and anyone can make it know they have finance available quite easily. So lets say you have $100 million and you've made the movie, you have first call on getting your money back as you took the risk. The actors/directors were paid months ago with your money. So you will set up a production company that is headquarters overseas that will hold the rights to the movie and you will normally get one of the major studios to distribute etc. So we will say 1 year later the movie raked in a total of $300 million, so we immediately take $120 million from that to cover the money we loaned and a some interest, so we have $180 left as profit. But profits are bad as they are taxed, so we say that we had to pay $170 million to the production company we already set up as they own the rights and mark $10 million as profit and pay tax on that. The other $170 will be sent overseas to minimize the tax we must pay, but don't worry in a few months that will be back in our pockets too.\n\nIf the movie flunks?\n\nThe studio loses out if it financed the film\n\nIf we went to a financier/bank they lose out."},

Austria-Hungary was a pretty weak military power, and the Ottoman Empire was dissolving. On the other side you had France, Russia, and the UK--the best Navy and the largest army. \n\n* Kaiser Wilhelm II was kinda crazy. While Otto vo Bismarck made it a foreign policy objective to keep Russia as an ally, the Kaiser allowed Russia to join Germany's worst enemy, the French. And he had a love-hate relationship with his English maternal heritage. \n\n* Germany didn't \"beat\" Russia, they just got lucky that the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 led to Russia withdrawing from the war. \n\n* Belgium was neutral before the war but was invaded as part of the [Schlieffen Plan.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlieffen_Plan) The idea was that the German army would be able to mobilize faster than anyone else, sprint through Belgium, and flank France. With Paris ideally captured they would be free to wage war in the East with Russia.

{"title":"ELI5: Why does speeding up an audio clip make it high pitched?","answer":"All sound is simply a vibration in time.  The pitch of the sound is, literally, the frequency of the vibration - the faster something vibrates, the higher its pitch will be.  This can be seen easily when you pluck a guitar string.  The high pitched strings' vibration can barely be perceived the string is moving back and forth so fast - it looks like a blur.  The Lowest pitched string can be seen to move back and forth very clearly.  \n\nThe key in this is time.  If the pitch is simply the frequency of vibration in time - what happens when we decrease the time?  The frequency *must* increase, because we are forcing the vibration to occur the same number of times in a smaller space of time.  \n\nSpeeding up an audio clip is exactly that - decreasing the time it takes to play it.  That decrease in time increases the frequency of all the vibrations on the recording by the same amount, which in turn increases the pitch.  "},

{"title":"ELI5: Interventional Radiology","question_detail":"I'm also trying to get a feel for what stents and catheters are able to do.  I understand the benefit in general of minimally invasive procedure are and that is a part of Interventional Radiology but any perspective on this would be great.","answer":"The main advantage of interventional radiology is the fact that it is so minimally invasive, which greatly reduces recovery time and lowers the potential for post-surgical complications. It also tends to require less resources as most interventional procedures can be done with only local anesthetics rather than complete sedation.\n\nLet's take a look at a few examples of interventional procedures.\n\nAneurysms are a condition where the blood vessel walls weaken, causing it to balloon outwards. This can cause discomfort depending on where the ballooning occurs, as well as the potential for rupture, which leads to internal bleeding. In older methods, to combat this, surgeons would have to surgically open the patient up and reinforce the vessel from the outside. This is a long and complicated procedure because the major arteries are typically very deep in the body. Aneurysms in the brain are even hard because the surgeon needs to get past all the brain tissue without causing major, lasting damage to it.\n\nWith interventional radiology, a stent is basically a metallic lattice that is used to brace the artery walls from the inside rather than the outside. A catheter is just a plastic tube that's inserted into the artery of choice for entrance, typically the large artery near the groin - the femoral artery. The catheter's job is just to provide an easy access point for the doctor's to insert the stent through.\n\nAnother use for stents is when vessels become partially blocked due to calcifications (ie - the stuff that causes most heart attacks). Say a patient has a major vessel of their heart (a coronary artery) partially blocked and they have a heart attack. Depending on how badly blocked the vessel is, doctors can choose between different procedures. One is the common 'coronary artery bypass graft' which is heard a lot in the news, which involves taking a vein from somewhere else in the body and attaching it to the blocked artery before and after the blockage. A bypass is usually used when the blockage is too great to be treated any other way and this requires open-heart surgery.\n\nIf only a partial blockage is caused, then an interventional procedure is done. A stent is inserted, typically through a catheter inserted into the femoral artery, up to the heart and the stent is positioned in the region of the blockage. A small balloon inside the stent is inflated, causing the stent to expand outwards, literally pushing the vessel walls outwards and created an open passage. The stent becomes fixed into place, holding the vessel wall open.\n\nOnce again, I cannot stress the huge difference the level of invasiveness produces. I work in a hospital so I see a lot of patients who've had both interventional and non-interventional treatments, particularly neurology patients (aneurysms of the brain). A patient treated through interventional means can be in and out of the hospital in a few days with no adverse affects due to the procedure, as opposed to weeks or longer with other procedures along with complications from the surgery and a huge-ass scar on their skull.\n\nSource: Radiographer."},
{"title":"ELI5:Why the military has to use expensive company's to get products.","question_detail":"I'm curious, being in the military, why we have to use this company (not sure the name) to get all our products.

It was not high quality in any way and it doesn't make sense why we can't find cheaper ways to get necessary items.\n\nEDIT: U.S military","answer":"When the military buys stuff, it doesn't just buy some standard product that you have on the shelf: there are contracts and specifications that can easily run into hundreds of pages. Every aspect of the purchase, product, packaging, shipping is covered, and the supplier must provide certification that these requirements have been met. Often there are costly testing requirements as well.\n\nThen there is the ongoing risk and liability for any failure to meet some minor contractual requirement. The government does audits months after the sale, and at its discretion can impose fees and penalties. \n\nGo try to buy a hammer with a hundred page contract, and see how much it costs you.\n"},

In the event of a open wound, your immune system can react faster because it has already been exposed to the microorganisms in the air. "},

In the case of sound, its air pressure so a sound wave consists of air pressure waves consisting of alternating regions of high and low pressure that propagate through the air.\n\nWhen waves 'collide' what actually happens is the energy in those highs and lows are combined. If a wave's highest point meets another wave's lowest point and they're off equal, but opposite, value, they'll cancel each other out and you'll actually hear nothing.\n\nNow when you have sound coming from multiple sources, you have multiple series of sound waves being added together. The energy of these waves are added together, but they're not necessarily 'louder.' That's because as mentioned before, high and low pressure waves can cancel each other out. You can, in theory, have two sound sources completely negate each other's output (though that would require very precise placement of the sources and the observer).\n\nBear in mind that while sound wave energy is additive between sources, the measurement of sound energy, decibels, is an exponential scale."},

Why is the name \"Jarminder\"    spelled that way in english, etc. ","answer":"There are two different things going on here.  There is a process called transliteration, which is how you take words with a different character set and \"translate\" the sounds across into your character set.  For example, it's how ÐÐ¾ÑÐºÐ²Ð° (in cyrillic alphabet) becomes Moscow (in latin).  Secondly, there's how place or person names become known in foreign languages.  That's way less formal, and is often just \"whatever we first called these guys when we got here\".  That's why Chinese people call their nation ZhÅngguÃ³, but we call it China."},
{"title":"ELI5: how can the military shoot nuclear missiles out of the air without them exploding at some point?","answer":"Nuke warheads don't arm until terminal phase (when it's close to the ground ready to strike on the way down). This is to avoid accidents,misfires, and because you only want the electronics running for a very short time in case they malfunction. "},
{"title":"ELI5: Why shaving with a vibrating razor hurts less than a normal one???","question_detail":"Why vibration = less pain???","answer":"Because the vibrations cause the blades to move quicker. Take a standard blade and slide it quickly across your face, you'll get a clean, painless shave, now take the same blade and drag it slowly across your face, you'll get a shitty, painful shave. The reason is that the blade instead of cutting clean through the hair will instead cut half way and then pull the hair until your skin has no more stretch and the blade then cuts through your hair. That dragging causes irritation."},
{"title":"ELI5: When I get an allergic reaction (to peanuts), eating a lot of bread reduces the symptoms. Why is this?","answer":"My guess is that the bread acts like a kind of dilution.  Normally you would dilute something by mixing it in water, but water is absorbed pretty quickly in the gut while foods take more time to process.  So when you eat bread along with peanuts you're overall digestion is not processing peanuts 100% of the time.  You still digest them, but over a slower period of time."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why do I need to pump the gas on my old 80's car before I start it?","question_detail":"I want to know what I am doing mechanically and why, *please*.  I don't want to just go outside and pump the gas every morning because someone told me to do it.  I'm 5 and I'm already showing signs of independence  (It's a provisional driver's license.)\n\nFYI: I tried a few youtube videos but they all assume working knowledge of the rest of the car/motorcycle/lawnmower.  I have none of that.","answer":"Older cars are carbureted and newer cars are fuel injected.   Fuel injectors are controlled by yours cars computer when you turn the car on.  Your cars computer knows the optimal fuel to air ratio to start the car.  Carbureted cars need you to press down on the gas pedal to get the optimal fuel to air ratio flowing into your engine before combustion will happen and your car will start.  Basically you have to do what newer cars computers do.  When you push your foot down the throttle in the carburetor opens, the more you push down the wider it opens letting more fuel in.  There is a sweet spot that you hit when moving your foot up and down at which the car starts, that means you got the correct fuel to air ratio.  [Here's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BYm0HnLGRU) a quick video about carburetors."},
{"title":"ELI5:Human Reproduction","question_detail":"Having seen plenty of porn, I have a clear picture of what happens before the male shoots off and goes to sleep, but the microscopic aspects confound me. How does it work? Which gender is most important to the process? Meaning: who contains the most genetic information and is most likely to determine how the offspring develops?","answer":"&gt;who contains the most genetic information\n\nIt's 50/50. Although there are things called epigenetics where the environment that the egg and sperm were first made in can have influences.\n\n&gt;most likely to determine how the offspring develops\n\nDefinitely the female. All the development happens in the uterus for 40 weeks (ideally).\n\nSperm hits the cervix. The cervix will sort of sit in the pool of sperm in the back of the vagina. It will work its way through the hole of the cervix and into the uterus. From there the sperm (through a mechanism that really isn't still 100% understood) makes its where to the Fallopian tube. A few days ago, the egg will have already been released from the ovary into the Fallopian tube where it meets the sperm. The sperm and egg fuse to make a zygote. The zygote will begin multiplying and a few days later it will finally reach the uterus where it will implant into the side of it. There it will grow while being fed by the placenta through the umbilical cord.\n\nThe End.\n"},

How does something become your major or your minor?","answer":"A major is your main area of study. Most of the classes you take will go towards this program. \n\nSome people also opt for a minor, which is a secondary degree. A minor requires far fewer classes, usually around 5. \n\nNow, a major and minor can be closely related or completely different. I'm an engineer (major) with a minor in a foreign language. Some people I went to school with got a math minor, because many of the math classes we needed for engineering also counted towards the minor, so it only required 2 additional classes. \n\nNow, what's the point? A major is typically the field you are planning on going into for a career. A minor is a way to signify \"Hey! I also know a lot about this subject, but I'm not an expert\". "},
{"title":"ELI5 - Mainframes","question_detail":"I am fairly inept at computer hardware and software, been using Linux, Mac and PC operating systems for well over 15 years, however I am struggling with wrapping my head around the concept of mainframes.  They're incredibly stable and they have record uptime, but what is their advantage over banks of redundancy computers or, say, cloud computing?","answer":"from an application programming perspective there's hardly any difference between a \"mainframe\" and any other kind of server resource. a mainframe is just like a nickname for a really big, powerful server. \n\nwhy would it make sense to invest in a really big, powerful server instead of a whole rack full of small, cheap servers? there are a couple of reasons but mostly its alot of trade offs and engineering decisions. \n\nthe mainframe server might be uniquely well suited for a certain type of application that can actually use the huge amount of resources present on the singular mainframe server. this is not typical though. most applications work better by distributing them out to a whole bunch of small, cheap servers. \n\na single big mainframe might be less expensive to maintain. it takes up less space. it has fewer different parts. its more energy efficient. it takes fewer personnel to physically work on the hardware. it might be easier to keep it cool. this kind of stuff goes into cost considerations. the flipside of it is that because its a single big unit its WAY more expensive to replace it if it fails catastrophically, and its very inflexible. a cluster of small, cheap servers can be scaled outward by just adding more servers. a mainframe can't really be scaled at all. its pretty much fixed in its capacity when its built originally.

","answer":"When you don't get enough sleep, your body is basically in alert mode. Your body thinks there must be some good reason why it has been deprived of sleep, so you need to stay awake and figure it out. If you get good sleep, say 8 hours, the following night, you will wake up the next day feeling tired because you've lost sleep, but you are no longer in alert mode. when you wake up tired it probably means you are behind on your sleep."},

{"title":"ELI5: Weather","answer":"The sun is a mass of incandescent gas; a gigantic helium furnace. It shoots energy in every direction, and some of that energy hits the earth. We see it as light and feel it as heat. That's all you need for a clear blue day.   \nClouds are formed when water on the ground is heated, causing it to evaporate and turn into clouds. If there's a cloud that forgot to go into the sky, we call it fog. When there's enough water in clouds, the water starts to bunch up and get heavy. That makes it fall, causing rain.  \nHail and snow fall when rain gets too cold before it hits the ground. Sometimes, the water is still liquid up high, and sends big raindrops that freeze on the way down. That's called hail. If it's cold everywhere, it falls in soft little flakes instead of icy chunks, and we call it snow. Really, snow and hail are both ice - snow is just a lot smaller.  \nThunder and lighting are like static. If you wear wool socks on carpet and drag your feet, you get a spark from your finger next time you touch metal. Lightning is the same thing, but the earth is the one dragging it's socks on the carpet.    \nFinally, wind. When air gets hot, it rises. When air rises, cooler air has to rush in and take it's place. That movement of air creates wind.\n"},

But on every single site you can get one from, be it MusiciansFriend or GuitarCenter or Sweetwater, they all mark it down to a more reasonable price.\n\nTake the Ibanez RG550XH for example. Every site says its MSRP is something like $825, but they all have \"savings\" of $225, bringing it down to a more reasonable $600.\n\nWhat's the deal with that? If it's going to be sold for $600, why not just sell it for $600 and not pull the \"savings\" bullshit? I don't get it! ELI5 please.","answer":"MSRP stands for Manufacturer Suggested Retail Price. For the Ibanez you mention, MusiciansFriend, GuitarCenter etc will have a catalogue of all Ibanez Products that they can order from, in order to sell on to the public. This catalogue will list a price at which Ibanez believe these stores should sell the product at, however the stores believe that the price they are selling at it is a price that people are more likely to buy the Ibanez for.\n\n\nWhy do Ibanez have such a higher valuation than these stores? I imagine it's a mixture of the following:\nIbanez overprice their gear for the exact marketing reasons mentioned by Mason11987.\nIbanez may calculate the price based on the cost of selling that one guitar and making a reasonable markup, whereas these other stores have different ways of calculating taking into account Store Overheads, people impulse buying other things when in the store, making a higher markup on accessories such as cables etc."},
{"title":"ELI5: the webgame industry","question_detail":"I see certain names everywhere like BigDino and Armor Games. Are these the people making the game? Are the funding them, as a movie studio might? How do webgames make money? The entire architecture of the industry is perplexing to me.","answer":"The gaming industry (including webgames) in a nutshell:\n\n* Someone makes the game (a developer)\n* Someone finances the making of a game (a publisher)\n* Sometimes these are the same company (like Blizzard Entertainment developed and then published Diablo III)\n* Sometimes they are not (like where Crytek developed Crysis 3, while EA published it)\n\nSo yes, it is similar to a movie studio system. A developer/publisher has control over their own product, but they need to be able to front the money to make the game. A developer that cannot publish their own game has to answer quite a bit to the publisher, because it's the publisher's bank account on the line if the project fails. I've used traditional boxed products (Diablo III and Crysis III) as an example, but the model is the same for free-to-play online browser games (at least that's what I think you mean by \"webgames\"). A developer without the ability to publish their own game often has to go on a road show and pitch the idea to publishers to get the money to actually hire people and make some content. \n\nThere's also a huge indie scene in this industry, where developers (again, the people making the game) are going straight to the consumer (think Kickstarter) or going to hands-off angel investors to get their funding (angel investors are handing over a blank check, not expecting to have any say like a publisher). Or the are employed by a well-known developer for a few years, then quit and use their savings to make a game on their own.\n\nAgain, I'm assuming you meant free-to-play browser games when you said \"webgames\". If so, then their money is made from microtransactions, in-game advertising, and tie-in products. \n\nSource: I work in this industry. And don't feel bad for not understanding the architecture. It's a young industry, constantly changing and following very few preset rules. "},

But I don't understand setting up \"victim funds\" for some of them?    \n\nIt makes sense when you're talking about things like hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, etc. where people lose *everything* and need funds just to survive.  But what does the money for the other fundraiser events go to?  ","answer":"&gt; But what does the money for the other fundraiser events go to?\n\nA lot of the money goes to running the event.

{"title":"ELI5: How a bomb can blow off clothes but leave the skin underneath intact? And is it the shrapnel that does the damage?","question_detail":"I've seen photos of Boston where people have had their trousers shredded but appear to have fine skin - I don't understand what it is that causes the material to shred or even what removes limbs in the first place. Is it the shrapnel that does it? ","answer":"The explosion itself is a lot of energy being released all at once. There are lots of ways that energy can be transmitted -- tossing the shrapnel into the air at high speed is one way. But it can also act on the air itself. It pushes the air molecules so hard, they move in a shockwave. [If the shockwave is strong enough, you can actually see it distort the air around the explosion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=fGi0w7ycRKk#t=72s). Getting hit with that is like getting hit with an all-body punch at incredibly high velocity. It can easily rip off limbs.\n\nNow imagine a very, very strong wind with nothing else but the wind (that is, no debris). You could easily see how such a wind could tear clothes off, because they have some give, some loose areas where the air can catch and pull. Your skin is not (generally, barring recent massive weight loss) that loose, and so doesn't get pulled by the air. Your skin is also generally more resilient than clothing to being torn off. So the clothing gets ripped by the wind of the shockwave itself."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why are we paying cable companies for TV?","question_detail":"I've been wondering this for some time.      \n  I don't understand why we pay cable companies for television. At one end we have the major networks such as FOX, NBC, CBS, ABC, etc., and these networks are paid by advertising. These networks are supplied to us by cable companies, who we pay.  \nSo the cable companies are acting as a middle man, that is unnecessary. The networks make no money from the cable companies despite providing content, and the network make money from advertising. \nSo why isn't TV free for us?    ","answer":"You can see broadcast TV over the air with an antenna.  If you live in a good location, you can get broadcast networks at a quality as cable.  If that's all you want, you don't need to pay them a dime.\n\nThe problem is that some people want networks that don't broadcast locally (e.g ESPN, TNT, AMC). Cable provides a service for them (and they cost money).  Other people can't get a very good signal, cable provides a service for them.\n\nVery few people *just* have basic cable that includes the bare minimum  of channels that are all available on broadcast.
