{"title":"ELI5: What would happen if scientists shrunk a human being to the size of a particle?","question_detail":"and, further, what would happen if the tiny man looked through a microscope at the surface of the smallest substance?","answer":"You can't shrink things, only compact them.  The laws of physics specify both the sizes of elementary particle and the stable distances between them.  If you moved all the matter in a human close enough together to fit inside an elementary particle, you'd get either a really violent fusion reaction or possibly a black hole.  "},
{"title":"ELI5: Horseshoes","question_detail":"What specific benefits do they give?\n\nHow did horses survive successfully without them?\n\nWhy doesn't driving nails into the horse's hoof cause problems?\n\nWhat else can you tell me about horseshoes?","answer":"Horseshoes reduce the wear on the hoof due to hard surfaces like paved roads.  It can also correct for poor hoof strength that can arise from selective breeding.\n\nWild horses walked on softer ground, and weren't worked as hard as domestic horses.  Also, if a wild horse was born with inferior hoofs, would likely get injured an die, so sometimes, they didn't survive.  A domestic horse with similar hoofs can survive and be productive with horseshoes.\n\nIf it is done right, it should cause a problem.  Hoofs are not living flesh, and are similar to your fingernails.  However, it is possible to make a mistake, like having the nail reach live flesh (the quick)...this is painful to the horse, and can lead to serious problems."},
{"title":"ELIF: If I tilt my head left and right, why do I still perceive the world upright?","answer":"Because you don't perceive the world as right side up in the first place.\n\nThe lens of your eye inverts the image that hits your retina, so if you look at a person standing in front of you, their feet at at the top part of your retina and their head is at the bottom.  \n\nThe Brain automatically corrects this.  In fact they put goggles on people that inverted the light before it reached their eyes, and for  a few days they saw the world upside done, but after that the brain corrected it and they saw right side up.  When they took off the inverting goggles, the brain kept doing the same thing, so they again saw the world upside down, but again the brain corrected itself after a few days."},

They had a 1KW CO2 laser which could cut a 2X4 in half, and also a 200W pulse laser which could make these loud explosions in the air.  No target, just the light itself ionizes the air at the focal spot.  Makes a blue-white dot, and a sound like a small firecracker.  I think they used focusing mirrors, since lenses tend to shatter.\n\nTo draw that sphere shown in the video, how do they change the focal length so fast?  I have no idea.  It's easy to use rotary mirrors to sweep a beam fast side-side or up-down.  But how do they move it in and out for 3D????\n\nHere are some older videos and articles:\n\n[Laser focus breakdown: circles, spirals, butterflies (2006)](http://www.aist.go.jp/aist_e/latest_research/2006/20060210/20060210.html)\n\n[Animated circle w/air breakdowns, 2006 Siggraph youtube.com/watch?v=ZeqIZyUMDP4](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeqIZyUMDP4)\n\n[Air breakdown at beam focus, 0.2joule IR laser pulses youtube.com/watch?v=1HHJhpStza0](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HHJhpStza0)\n\n[CO2 pulse laser, air breakdown 1.0joule youtube.com/watch?v=6N-mz0krcmk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N-mz0krcmk)\n\n[ 100 gigawatt air breakdown youtube.com/watch?v=jBjqT3AQkH0](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBjqT3AQkH0)\n\nSo it's not really a hologram.  It's a bunch of little air-plasma explosions created by a pulse laser.

{"title":"ELI5 the difference between marriage and a civil union and the pros and cons of each","answer":"In the context of gay rights, the major difference is that there *is* a difference (I'm not sure if this is why you are inquiring). Some countries and states allow homosexuals to enter into civil union, but not into marriage. This is perceived as creating a second class of citizen by means of offering them a separate, or sub-par, form of marriage.

{"title":"ELI5 Why does OWS not have a manifesto?","answer":"\nTheir goal is to point out that our economic system is just plain not working for most people.  They want people to question whether it has to be that way.  They want people to think about how it ended up favoring such a small minority, while leaving most normal people struggling.  They believe that an economy that isn't designed to work for everyone is a badly designed economy.\n\nAs for having a specific set of policy suggestions: many members of the movement have ideas for how to make things better.  But those are just suggestions, experiments to try.  The suggestions aren't set in stone.  What is set in stone is the idea that we need to start experimenting, and we need to keep it up until we find a system that works for everyone.\n\nAs for a manifesto: any small group of protestors could conceivably get together and write a manifesto.

So say how theme park attendance rises along with good word of mouth, improvements on rides, and increased customer service (by say hiring more staff and enacting new policies).\n\nwith a hierarchal linear model, as I understand it you would track how customer service and ride repair affected word of mouth *and then* look at how word of mouth affected attendance.\n\nthe idea is the ride repairs don't bring new customers in and of themselves, but they improve word of mouth by existing customers, which increases new visitors.

{"title":"ELI5 Those little handwarmers you snap the metal bit \ninside to activate","question_detail":"How do they work?","answer":"You may remember from Chemistry class that when you cool water, the water/ice combination goes down to 0 degrees C and then stays there until it is completely frozen, and only then does it go below 0.\n\nWell, the liquid inside the handwarmer thing freezes at a temperature of around 50 degrees C.  When the handwarmer is at room temperature, it is below the freezing point.  So why doesn't it freeze, you ask?  Well, some liquids can be \"supercooled\" like dmukya said and linked to.  That means that the liquid is below the freezing temperature, but it hasn't frozen yet because it doesn't know the right way to fit together to form into a solid.\n\nWhen you snap the metal bit, that \"jolts\" some of the molecules in the liquid into the right position to form into a solid.  This starts the freezing process, which you can watch right before your very eyes.\n\nNow, remember the Chemistry class where water stayed at its freezing temperature until it was completely frozen?  Well, the amazing thing is that this will be true even if the liquid is supercooled.  While the liquid is freezing, it will warm up and stay at its freezing temperature (50 C) until it is completely frozen.  It takes a while to freeze, so it will stay warm for a while until it is completely frozen, then it will start to cool down again.\n\nThe way the recharging works is that you heat it up past its freezing point to melt it, then you let it cool beyond its freezing point without disturbing it so that it becomes supercooled again.\n\nNote:  I made up the \"50 C\" number.  I don't actually know the freezing temperature of those things, but it is somewhere between 20 and 100 C."},

The magnetic field will induce a current in the metal, which will convert to heat because of the metal's resistance to current.\n\nWhy is it so fast?  Because it's efficient.  Compared to a regular electric stove, induction generates the heat directly in the bottom of the pan.  A regular stove would generate the heat in the stove , then transfer it to the pan by conduction, and to everything else in the vicinity actually.  It's both inefficient and slow.\n"},

[This](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Australia-Greenland_Overlay.png) picture makes comparing the two very easy, and you can see why Australia is a continent.

Every time there is food to be found, the first species will get their first, because they can smell it from far away. This repeats for centuries until all members of the second species have died and you are left with dogs who can smell food from far away.\n\nIn this remaining species of dogs, over a period of time, you get 2 more sub-species: one which can smell even further and the one which can smell just as far as its ancestors.\n\nNow the original surviving sub-species is at a disadvantage and will eventually die out, leaving us with dogs who can smell even better.\n\nThis process repeats for thousands of years until no more variations in smelling capability occur (or aren't needed).\n\nSo it all boils down to which species has better tools to survive in nature. The others are left behind.\n\n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that these variations are not a response to the environment (dogs are not enhancing their smelling to survive, it's just that those varieties that have it survive and the rest perish)"},

{"title":"ELI5: Difference between special relativity and general relativity","answer":"Special relativity starts with the idea that light will always go at the speed of light relative to you, no matter how fast you're going. Even if you're going at 99.999% lightspeed, if you shine a flashlight in front of you, the light will seem to outpace you by 186,000 miles per second. But to someone else, it will appear to barely pull ahead of you. \n\nEinstein accepted that, saying there's no fundamental difference between standing still and going a million miles an hour, you can only measure your speed relative to other objects. He worked out how it can make sense without being a giant contradiction. He said it's because when you're going close to lightspeed, time slows down, distances change, and you increase in mass. This last part also resulted in e=mc^2, which says a little bit of mass can convert into a huge amount of energy.\n\nSpecial relativity ignores gravity and acceleration. General relativity includes them, and says they're the same thing. If you're in a room, being pulled to one side by something that feels like a gravitational force, it could be because you're accelerating, or because you're on a planet. There's no measurement you can make, without looking outside the room, to tell the difference between those situations. So Einstein worked out the math to make sense of this, and ended up with gravity curving space, and time slowing down where there's more intense gravity."},
{"title":"ELI5 : 5/1 Adjustable Rate Mortgage","question_detail":"I'm trying to educate myself before attempting to buy my first home.  So please ELI5 if this should be considered.  Thanks!","answer":"A 5 year ARM is a 30 year mortgage where the rate is only \"fixed\" or \"locked in\" for 5 years. After the 60th payment, your rate can then adjust. Depending upon the type of ARM, it may adjust up or down 1% per year (FHA) or up to 2% per year (conventional) depending upon where the market is at that time. The \"1\" in 5/1 means that it only adjusts once per year. Most ARMs have what is called a \"cap\" meaning that no matter how high rates go, the rate cannot exceed the cap rate (generally 5% above your original rate) Here's an example of the worst case scenario:\n\n5 Year ARM (Let's say it has a 2% cap yearly, and 5% overall)\n\n\n3.5%\n\nYears 1-5.. 3.5%\n\nYear 6.. 5.5%(2% increase on 1st adjustment)\n\nYear 7.. 7.5% (Another 2% jump if rates bear it)\n\nYear 8.. 8.5% (Now we've reached our cap, it can't ever exceed 8.5%)\n\nSo, even if rates are TERRIBLE, it would take you 8 years before you would hit your cap.\n\nThe 5 year ARM carries interest rates significantly lower than your traditional 30 year fixed mortgages. You are not REQUIRED to refinance out of the ARM, so you could continue to ride the adjustments yearly, and finish this loan out to the 30 year term.\n\nRight now, most people who are in adjusting ARMs actually are adjusting down, due to rates being so low in the market today.\n\nGenerally, this program is geared towards people who don't plan on staying in their home for very long- or for people looking for that initial larger savings, who would be able to handle the transition to a possibly higher payment down the road.\n\nAre you looking to purchase using an FHA Loan? Those ARMs are a bit more conservative- they only adjust up or down 1% each year, with the 5% cap. It would take you 10 years to hit your cap in an FHA loan."},

{"title":"ELI5: Ron Paul's political standing","question_detail":"Pretty much what Ron Paul would do if he were elected president and his opinion of the major issues in America.","answer":"Ron Paul believes the federal government (especially the president) has too much power, and that much of it should be transferred downward to the states, and \"horizontally\" to private companies and organizations. For Paul, if you reduce the power that rests with the Presidency, everyone else gains more freedom. \"Everyone else\" largely includes the States for Paul. States should have more power because they are closer to the people, and people know what's best for themselves.\n\n**I don't many specifics, so I'll provide a broad outline of his major policy platforms using frequently asked question and popular reactions to many of his positions. I will explain his reasoning behind his positions as well, because he had the most problem communicating that part.**\n\n* **He wants to cut the Department of Education and stuff. Isn't that extreme?**\n\nHe wants to **cut $1 trillion in spending during his first year**. As a libertarian, he believes a lot of things don't need to be done by government that the government is currently doing. And he's right in many respects. Government used to provide a lot of social services like poverty alleviation programs and direct foreign aid. But recently, government privatized a lot of these programs by giving the job to NGOs who do charity work. It has worked! Government spends less, and a lot of these poverty and foreign aid organizations do even better than the government.\n\nSo why is everyone afraid? Well, the way he wants to cut spending is by **eliminating five departments: Education, Energy, Commerce, Interior, and Housing and Urban Development**. What do these Departments that he wants to eliminate actually do?\n\nLet's start with the **Department of Education**. Jimmy Carter created this in its present form in 1979, but the Department of Education was around since 1867, meaning it's been around for 145 years. It is the smallest Department. Firstly, the DoED ***does not*** determine what students learn, or run schools. It's mainly here to keep tabs on [how smart our students are](http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/pdf/main2011/2012459.pdf), and what can we do to make them smarter. They also provide some funding to make it easier for a lot of kids to go to school. Therefore getting rid of the Department of education doesn't mean we get rid of the public school system. It just means passing a lot this responsibility back to the states. Critics say that the DoED provides crucial statistics so the country knows what it's problems are, and that states don't have the means and can many times be [backwards in their education policy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epperson_v._Arkansas).\n\nHe also wants to get rid of the **Department of Energy**. This department was also created by Jimmy Carter, and is only 35 years old. What do they do? They take care of the country's nuclear bombs and nuclear plants. They also run famous laboratories like Ames, Fermilab and Los Alamos (your modern day Black Mesas and Apertures). They also see how Americans are using electricity [getting electricity](http://energy.gov/maps/2009-energy-consumption-person), and lead the shift toward renewable energy sources by encouraging energy growth in that sector (green energy industries don't pop up by themselves).\n\nHe wants to eliminate the **Department of Commerce**. This department is 109 years old and was created to make the American economy grow faster. This is the \"job creation\" part of government. It came out of the thinking that government could get involved and create more jobs. How does it do this? It takes the economic pulse of the nation, finds out [in what areas](http://www.esa.doc.gov/sites/default/files/reports/documents/thecompetitivenessandinnovativecapacityoftheunitedstates.pdf) the country needs to improve to compete internationally, and does [trade missions](http://www.trade.gov/about.asp). They even give us [the weather](http://www.noaa.gov/index.html).\n\nThe **Department of the Interior** is 163 years old and started by President Polk. It takes care of the country's [national parks](http://www.nps.gov/index.htm), makes sure our animals don't go extinct (prevents a tragedy of the commons), warns us of [earthquakes](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/) and maintains government-owned land.\n\nAnd the last department he wants to get rid of is the **Department of Housing and Urban Development**. This was created by President Johnson and is 47 years old. It makes housing more affordable to people, and helps cities do this as well. It's basically a big landlord. It keeps an eye on the level of homelessness across the country, and where it is most prominent.\n\n**Why is this scary to a lot of people?** It is scary to many people to eliminate these five departments because these agencies play host to a ***huge chunk of America's scientific development***. They take care of so many important laboratories, track the climate, and secure biodiversity. They also study how to make America smarter, give many a place to live and improve trade growth. It is also scary because these are the ***main bodies of policy research and excellence***. What exactly is the *best policy* to achieve a certain goal? This question can be answered, and the policy professionals in these departments do the hard research to find out. The departments are home to not only scientific development, but also policy development.\n\n**Here's the important part that Ron Paul failed to communicate: why it maybe isn't a big deal.** It's not a big deal for three reasons. Firstly, it isn't a big deal because a lot of the agencies under these departments have been ***doing their job before*** the departments were even created. The government was providing affordable housing before the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Trade missions were being conducted before the Department of Commerce. Big labs like Los Alamos existed before the Department of Energy was created. A lot of these services don't necessarily need to go with the agencies. President Ron Paul may choose to restructure important agencies into other areas of government. Secondly, a lot of the ***scientific and policy research may be taken care of by the private sector***. A lot of labs and think tanks are private organizations, or under a research university. Physics research is performed under research universities. Educational policy is done by think tanks. The government needs not do these things any more. Thirdly, a lot of these things are ***supposed to be done at the state-level not the federal government***. American states are supposed to take care of things like education, commerce, but the federal government has grown too big. By getting rid of the department, Ron Paul may want to transfer a lot of the responsibilities to the provinces, meaning we won't necessarily stop doing it.\n\n\n* **He wants to deregulate everything! Isn't that dangerous?**\n\nIt doesn't seem dangerous for him and other libertarians because they see the market taking care of that danger. How does this work? What would happen if the government no longer regulated quality of food, the maze of airline traffic, and school curriculums? Wouldn't we be poisoned, unsafe and, dumber? [Ron Paul's response](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=BaKx2r60NHA#t=86s) is no, because reputed rating companies would emerge like [Consumer Reports](http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/index.htm) that will tell consumers what is the real deal, and what is simply a scam. These types of companies run on consumer trust, so being honest and sincere is the best way these companies could be profitable. Now, not only do you pay less (you only pay for the consumer reports you are interested in, not a block of taxes for an entire department), but the products are not regulated, meaning that you will have the freedom to purchase more products. \n\nHe also wants to remove many financial regulations. This is done through repealing two major pieces of legislation. **Repealing the Dodd-Frank Act** would mean that many public companies won't need to report CEO compensation, that derivative could be traded more freely (what many pruport to be the cause of the 2008 mortgage crisis), and remove institutions created to provide transparency in trading. He wants to **repeal Sarbanes-Oxley Act** which largely demands accounting transparency in publicly traded companies to protect investors from another Enron or WorldCom. His rationale is that Dodd-Frank includes a lot of bloat, and increases the responsibilities of the government. His rationale against Sarbanes-Oxley is that it [discourages companies](http://paul.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=209&amp;Itemid=60) from listing on American stock exchange--and it's [true](http://admin.darden.virginia.edu/emUpload/uploaded_backup2007b/Chaplinsky_paper.pdf). He wants to also repeal Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\n* **What's all this talk about the Federal Reserve?**\n\nA lot of people are more knowledgeable on monetary policy than I am, so I'll just go over what he wants to do. He wants to conduct a **full audit on the Federal Reserve**. What does this mean? He tried to see what the Fed was doing last time through the Freedom of Information Act, but the Fed ignored it. Now he wants to pass a law forcing open the Fed's books by legislating an audit. Why? He thinks the Federal Reserve is a cartel: an independent group controlling all the money supply. It *enables big government spending* because it can print more of it. It *allows for big bank bailouts*. If you could add more zeros to the amount of money, the money you and I have [diminishes in value](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=NC-1VP0c-aI#t=189s)!\n\n**EDIT:** Will continue adding the other sections, including his positions on taxes, and social issues like abortion, gay marriage, marijuana, and faith later on.\n"},

The Security Council \"may decide what measures *not involving the use of armed force*\" are to be employed to enforce the provisional measures we talked about above. This usually means calling on some or all UN members states to apply a number of different kinds of sanctions, such as \"complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations.\"\n\n* If that doesn't work, shit gets real.

{"title":"ELI5: Contras","answer":"**Contras:**\n\nBefore the cold war, Nicaragua used to be an oppressive dictatorship.  It only stopped with a socialist revolution that led to the fall of the dictatorship in 1979.  Not everybody was happy with that change, so there were counter-revolutionary groups that fought against the new power.  These groups are designated by the name \"Contra\", which is short for \"contrarrevolucion\" (counter-revolution).  \n\nContras were a mixed group composed of supporters of the old dictatorship, supporters of the socialist revolution who felt betrayed by the new power in place, or people who thought the new power was itself turning into a dictatorship.  But the Contras themselves fought with inhumane methods (kidnapping, rape, torture...)\n\nAt the end of the 80's, Contras were disbanded under the promise that democratic elections would take place in 1990, which marked the end of the revolutionary socialist regime.\n\n**Iran-Contra:**\n\nDuring the cold war, the USA was fighting against the expansion of communism in South and Central America.  In Nicaragua, the US was funding the Contras.\n\nAfter a while, the US congress changed its mind, but the president at the time (Reagan) still wanted to do it, so they would need secret funds.\n\nAt the same time, there was a hostage crisis with Iran, where a terrorist group was holding 6 American people.

{"title":"ELI5:  How do Nuclear Inspection Teams expect to find anything in countries that are clearly trying to hide their nuclear goals?","question_detail":"I read in the [news](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/46174915/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa/#.TySBU1y0yHc) today that the UN is sending inspection teams to Iran.  I've long since lost track of how often these teams go to crazy countries and there rarely seems to be any sort of discovery or progress with international relations.  What do these teams do?  What are they hoping to find?  Do they actually have any power?","answer":"They really only have symbolic power in the sense that whatever they do or don't find during an inspection is reported to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the United Nations and made available to various national and international agencies interested in the state of that country's nuclear goals.\n\nThe theory is that any nation with peaceful nuclear goals will be open and willing for the inspection teams to visit and verify their compliance with international regulations concerning nuclear technology development, particularly if they are signatory to the [international nuclear non-proliferation treaty](http://www.un.org/en/conf/npt/2005/npttreaty.html).  The technology required to enrich uranium to a grade required for a power plant is less sophisticated than what is required for a nuclear bomb.  Specifically, bomb-making material needs an extremely high enrichment percentage, something like over 90%.  If any technology indicating a high-enrichment capability is found then that nation can reasonably be seen as having ambitions other than power plant, medical, or other civil use.\n\nThe inspection teams also require to be able to visit any facility at any time, with or without warning.  Should a site be refused entry without a valid reason then circumstantial evidence can point to a \"what have you got to hide\"? rationale.  It may not be direct evidence but the usual public cat-and-mouse accusations and diplomatic posturing and double-talk usually follows for a while before sanctions, bombings, and invasions start."},

I hear people say things such as \"Java is better for programming a game.\" What is the difference between languages and what makes them better suited for certain situations?","answer":"It's lot like thinking about various tools.  If you need to drive a nail into a wall, a hammer would be a good choice.  If you need to unfasten a nut, then a hammer isn't a good choice.\n\nIt's a bit muddier because almost any language *can* be forced to perform any task, but some are better at certain things than others.\n\nFor example, programming something with a user interface (buttons and stuff to click on) is a lot simpler in Java than it would be in C.  You might write 50 lines of code to do it in Java, and 300 in C.  \n\nHowever, if you need to do something like write a program that looks for large prime numbers, the ability to have a user interface isn't important, but speed is.  So you might choose C over Java, since it is generally faster.  In this case it might be the same *amount* of code in each language, but the C code will run 40% faster.\n\nThe reality is that most languages are like a multitool or Swiss Army knife.  They all have a different selection of tools in them, but you *could* do almost any job with any of them.   \n\nEdit: I made up the numbers in this example, I don't feel like getting into a debate over the relative merits of each language.

How do they get access to the ability to generate unlock codes, and why doesn't someone just offer the generator for free already?","answer":"All legal unlock methods (the kind that don't void your warranty) are straight from the manufacturer. The manufacturer of your phone keeps a large private database, and each phone has a unique unlock code. A reseller pays the manufacturer money to be able to search this database. \n\nThere is no generator, as they are unique to YOUR phone. Every phone has a unique code, called the IMEI, that is entered while running the search for the unlock code. \n\nThere are several other ways to unlock your phone, such as a SIM hack, which is a thin circuit board, between the SIM card and the phone contacts, that can be used to emulate a carrier's SIM format.\n\nAs an aside, unlock codes are usually not avail for hot, brand new phones, because the phone usually has a 3 month or so exclusivity contract with a certain carrier, and they get a lot of money to keep it that way.

Yes some (indeed) many middle-class (even lower middle-class) Americans live in homes that are similarly \"nice\" and relatively comfortable and modern as you see... BUT, in order to facilitate \"filming\" and movement of actors around rooms, the sets of homes tend to be a bit more \"spread out\" than the real homes of most \"average\" Americans.\n\n&gt;ELI5 the american lifestyle. Is it really common for poor people to live in multi-bedroom private house with a lawn? \n\nHere this really depends on your definitions. What do you mean by \"poor people\", and then what do you mean by \"multi-bedroom\", or \"private house\" and then even the definition of \"lawn\".\n\nI'll try to take them in what I think is perhaps a bit of a better order:\n\n* **Private House**\n\nFirst, yes a large percentage of people (probably somewhere around 1/2 of all families) live in a \"private\" home; in the sense that it is a separate and distinct building, unattached to other buildings; and also that it is *privately* owned (not a government housing project), though the family occupying the house may not be the owner, but may simply be \"renting\" from a private landlord. \n\nBut, of the remaining families (and by families I am including single people) probably 1/2 or so (1/4 of the total) live in a quasi-private, quasi-shared type of building that is called a \"duplex\" or \"condo\" -- typically this will be like 2, 4, 6 or more private houses that are \"attached\" to each other.\n\nThe remainder (the last 1/4 or so of the total) generally live in some kind of \"apartment\" building containing a large number of units -- anywhere from a dozen for a small two story building, to hundreds in the case of urban high-rises.\n\nThere are other options (things called mobile homes, etc) and while not uncommon, only a small percentage of the population lives in them (more in some regions than in others).\n\nOn to...\n\n* **Multi-Bedrooms**\n\nYes, most *families* will live in what you would call a \"multi-bedroom\" home (or even apartment). \n\nTypically the parents will buy a home (or rent an apartment/condo) with sufficient bedrooms for themselves and children. They will have a private bedroom for themselves (as a married couple) and then each *gender* of children will have a distinct bedroom (son or sons in one bedroom, daughter or daughters in another). \n\nThese rooms are NOT necessarily large (at least in comparison to other rooms in the house) often they are no more than 8 ft x 10 ft (about 2m x 3m); and I have known several families that manage to squeeze 3 or even 4 children (of varying ages; but invariably always just a single gender) into a single bedroom of that size. Except in the wealthier large families rarely will children get their own private bedrooms.\n\nNow that is not always the case, and in smaller families (with either only one or two children, or only a few young children left at home older siblings having moved out) it is not uncommon for an individual child to have their own \"private\" bedroom.  \n\nNor are all such bedrooms as small as I mentioned previously, my own bedroom growing up (atypically large for the era, even though we were FAR from being \"rich\") was 12ft x 14 ft (about 3.5m x 4.25m), and my older brother had his own similarly sized room (as did our parents -- they built their own \"new\" home, on a corner country property of my father's family farm, and built it on purpose as a 3 bedroom as they already had one child and were planning on having several more, of both genders: they ended up only having two, and both of us being boys we shared a single bedroom for several years while young {with upper/lower \"bunk\" beds as the younger child I was stuck on top}, and the other bedroom remained empty or used as a \"guest room\" when our grandparents or other relatives visited from out of town. As we got older and it became evident that my parents would NOT be having any more children (and no daughters at all) my brother was allowed to move into the former \"guest\" bedroom, which left me also with my own room {had there been a 3rd son I would have continued sharing}); we only had to \"share\" then when infrequent guests would visit (and my brother lost \"his\" room for a few nights). While the size of our particular bedrooms was a bit larger than the norm (something I really only became aware of as I got older) I do have to say that the arrangement we had was fairly common amongst most of my classmates whether they lived in the rural areas, or \"in town\", and whether in apartments or separate homes.\n\nSome of the newer homes (often disparagingly called \"McMansions\") that were built within the past decade or two will have even larger bedrooms (i.e. 4m x 4m or larger), some with even a private shared \"en suite\" toilet/bath room connected or close to the children's rooms, while the parents have their own separate &amp; distinct toilet/bath room. These were built all over the country during the housing \"bubble\" and because credit/debt was readily available, many lower &amp; lower-middle class American families moved into them and lived in them for a number of years (even though it became apparent later on that they really could not afford to do so). Sadly a lot of these homes are now sitting empty and unoccupied, the previous \"owners\" having lost them via foreclosure to banks, and yet the banks not really wanting to sell them at too low of a price, not wanting to rent or properly maintain them, nor are they willing to extend loans on them again -- meanwhile many of these homes are beginning to deteriorate as they have no one to maintain them; and of course the families that previously lived somewhat lavishly in them, have since been crowded into other, less lavish housing (sometimes even having to move in with another family of relatives, or renting motel rooms, etc -- circumstances vary across the country in this regard).\n\n(Continued in reply...)"},
{"title":"Why does my internet get slower when more people are using it?","answer":"Very simple explanation: The reason for why things go slower is like if there were two people talking in a room, they can say a certain number of things per minute.\n\nNow we add a bunch of more people, and if they all try to talk at once people can't hear each other because of the noise. So only a few people can talk at once, the rest has to wait.\n\nSo they have a certain \"bandwidth\" of number of things that can be said at a time in that room without everything turning into noise, and they all share it."},

{"title":"ELI5: Instrumental Variable","question_detail":"[Instrumental Variable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_variable)\n\nMe confused long time.","answer":"It's a variable you use in statistical analysis as a proxy for another variable that you're interested in studying, but can't either because data would be too difficult to collect or because it would bring additional noise into the study.\n\nFor example, maybe you want to see the effect illegal migration from mexico has on communities in Arizona. You can't collect proper data, because of the nature of illegal immigration. You could use rainfall in communities in mexico as an \"instrument\" for migration rates. Namely, you first find the effect of rainfall changes on migration, then create a new variable based on that, then you run the actual regression you're interested in by using the data set you created from rainfall data as a stand-in.\n\nAnother reason to use instrumental variables is to eliminate spurious correlations. Let's say you want to see the effect smoking has on college students' grades. If you just look at the number of cigarettes smoked, your study would be fucked up because smokers are different from non smokers. Smokers are also more likely to be drinkers, more likely to be drug users, more likely to be poor. Heavy smokers are more likely to be male while most smokers are female. Namely, you're commiting the cardinal sin of regression analysis by \"putting a choice variable on the left hand side\" of the equation. People choose to smoke, that choice says something about them personally, and it will ruin your study because you can't account for personality. Anyways, you could use tax rates on cigarettes as an instrument. Presumably smokers smoke less and some quit altogether when cigarette taxes go up. First you regress smoking on tax changes, use the outcome to form a new \"expected smoking level given current taxes\" and you use the new variable as a stand in for smoking which is unrelated to anything about the students themselves."},

Tell me about the pressure chambers of the head and where the pain comes from when it's blocked.\n\nAlso, any ideas or evidence as to why a complex pressure chamber system in the sinus would evolve?","answer":"You are a can. A can of beans that is at 0 meters elevation and is sealed all around except a tinny hole in the lid.\n\nThat means that normally you have 1 atmosphere of pressure pressing down on you from the outside. To counter this, there is 1 atm of pressure inside you, pressing outside - thus the net flow on air to and from the tinny hole is zero.\n\nNow, gradually, you are taken to a height of 40,000 feet. The pressure inside you is 1 atm, outside you it is less than 1 atm. The air from inside you starts escaping from the tinny hole. Since your climb was gradual, the flow of air inside to outside was gradual. Now, at this height, your internal and external pressure is equal at (for example) 0.91 atm.\n\nNow you skydive. You fall like a brick and reach 10,000 feet in 10 seconds. Air from outside (which is at 0.98 atm) rushed through the hole inside (where the pressure is lower, at 0.91 atm). This forced rush of air causes you discomfort and, in severe cases, pain. To add further obstacles, there is a diaphragm obstructing free flow of air and there are liquids which further complicate the airflow path.\n\nIn another example, you have 2 ~~tinny~~ tiny holes (ear and nasal) and there is some slime blocking them (flu, blocked sinuses etc). All the air flow pushes against the slime to pass through, causing you more pain (bridge of the nose, between eyebrows).\n\nThis complex system actually helps. If there was a large gaping air-pressure-equalization hole, I imagine it'd act like what happens when in the movies there is a hole in the wall of the airplane."},
{"title":"ELI5: Déjà vu: why it happens","question_detail":"On average once a week I am total blown away by the feeling \"I've been in this exact circumstance before\".

Why does this happen?","answer":"you weren't able to predict anything though were you? I don't think anyone's quite figured out what causes Deja vu 100%, but there are a good few theories. My personal favorite is that Deja vu is caused by stimulation of a certain part of your brain, the part that would normally alert you to when you've done something before. howstuffworks phrases it so: \"\n     They have since determined that the medial temporal lobe is involved in our conscious memory. Within the medial temporal lobe are the parahippocampal gyrus, the rhinal cortex and the amygdala. John D.E. Gabrieli at Stanford University found in 1997 that the hippocampus enables us to consciously recall events. He also found that the parahippocampal gyrus enables us to determine what's familiar and what isn't (and without actually retrieving a specific memory to do it).\"\n\nwhat this means is you just stimulate the part of your brain that usually lets you go \"oh yeah I did this before!\" which is why it can feel like you've done something when you know for a fact you haven't. I like this explanation, because whenever I get deja vu, I start thinking about deja vu, then i get deja vu about thinking about deja vu, and it just gets deeper from there until the feeling subsides.\nninja edit: source: http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/extrasensory-perceptions/deja-vu.htm"},

Since you didn't have possession at the time of the foul it can't be an offensive foul and since he didn't have possession of the ball it can't be a defensive foul. "},

{"title":"ELI5: Why is pokemon so great? ","question_detail":"I missed the craze, but I love video games! When I saw a pic of two gameboys linked up I thought man, I bet I would have loved that.\n","answer":"I'm not really sure this is appropriate for ELI5...maybe /r/gaming, [/r/askreddit](/r/askreddit) or [/r/pokemon](/r/pokemon) or [/r/ludology](/r/ludology) .  That said, I think a significant part of Pokemon's popularity simply came from the fact that, well, it was a fad.  And that isn't meant as an insult.  I was part of the \"first wave\" of Pokemon fans...born in 89.  The majority of boys in my class loved the game.\n\nIn order for a game to become that popular--even if its with children--it has to be good.  Or at least good at it's intended goals.  It was a very addicting game.  But what skyrocketed it to popularity was the fact that it was easy to create a culture around it.\n\nIn the late 90s, it was a symbol of pride to be able to rattle off all 150 pokemon in order.  You fight tournaments during recess.  Everyone around you (even the girls!) could identify any pokemon, and if they couldn't, they'd be mocked.  We developed legends about Pokemon, like how to capture Mew and when Missingno was discovered, that rocked our world.\n\nOur school used to have a \"spaghetti supper\" every year, a fundraiser thing.  It was a thing that happened at night.  These became Pokemon conventions, where kids would bring their gameboys and battle and trade with each other.  But it wasn't something we *planned*, it was something we *assumed*, because it was such a big part of our lives that of course we'll bring our gameboys there.  Why the fuck *wouldn't* we fight pokemon there?\n\nAnd today it lives on.  Look how many submissions there are on reddit about pokemon.  Legends and myths and inside jokes about the original games are posted on reddit everyday, and few people say \"what the fuck is this?\"  Only those born in weird countries or those who were too young or old say that.  Everyone in the first wave though...they understand most of the jokes/references.  \n\nPokemon is something that most late-80s early-90s children understand.  It's something we all share.  That is why so many of us love it so much.  Not the franchise itself, but the sense of community and nostalgia we have about it."},

{"title":"Explain Secular Humanism like I'm five.","answer":"A long time ago, almost everybody believed in God. They believed that all humans are a little bit bad because of what Eve did in the Bible. They also thought that all humans need to look at God like a teacher, and to try to be good all the time because it makes God happy. \n\nHumanists said that being good isn't just about following the Bible. It's also about making your friends happy. The early Humanists said that making Mr. God happy is great, but you *also* need to be really nice to everyone *just for the sake of being nice*. And they said that everyone can be an inventor or a great artist or a great athlete in their own way, because humans are actually pretty great. \n\nLater on, less people believed in God. Doing things that have nothing to do with God is called \"Secular\". So, Secular Humanists are people who are pretty nice and ambitious, because they think that humans can do really great things, without having to believe in God. "},

{"title":"ELI5: The Bank Transfer System - Why does it take multiple business days to transfer money between accounts?","answer":"It's a holdover from the old days before computers.\n\nWay back in the day before computers, when banks had to keep track of everything on paper, it was way too much of a pain to transfer money in the middle of the day. You'd have to hire a guy to take the money, run across town, deposit it in the other bank, run back, and then have to do that all over again. It's much easier to keep track of all the transfers, then do them all at once. This is called a batch - which helps with accounting also, since instead of handling individual checks or bills, you can handle many at once.\n\nBeing as banks were important, there came to be a lot of regulations around their activities, and once they have something that works, banks really do not want to change unless they have to. It doesn't cost them much extra to keep doing things this way.\n\nSo even though it's technically possible to do real time transfers now, banks don't because that's not how they used to do it, the regulations haven't caught up, and doing so it's going to get them any more customers or save them any money."},

Most all of the important discoveries occurred in Germany, the U.S., and France.\n\nSynthetic fuels are liquid chemicals that can be used to power an engine.  Being mostly hydrocarbons, they are derived from sources like crude oil, natural gas, coal, plastics, or certain biological sources such as algae.\n\nCan we use them as a reliable power source in the near future?

{"title":"Can someone in the financial/insurance/auto industry explain GAP insurance?","answer":"I'm not in the industry, but I can offer an easy explanation of GAP insurance with an example. \n\nLet's say you buy a 20$K car and you get a loan for 20$K to pay for it and you buy car insurance (legally required where I live). \n\nIf the next day the car is sitting in your driveway and a satellite falls on it, then the car insurance company will give you money for the value of the car, ***which is now less than 20$K*** since you drove it off the car lot (likely it would be around ~18$K depending on the car make/model). If you had GAP insurance, then that insurance will pay the amount you owe on the loan, which means they give you 20$k and you can spend the 18$K car insurance money on a new car (or they might just set you up with the same make/model of the car you lost, depends on the car insurance). If you don't have GAP insurance then you would spend the ~18$K paying off part of your 20$K loan and still owe money on a car you don't have anymore and have to buy a whole new car to replace it. \n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: Supercooling","question_detail":"I saw a video of a beer instantly freezing when being tapped after being in the freezer for a while, can someone explain supercooling like im five?.","answer":"There is a big difference between a cold liquid and a solid. In a liquid, all the molecules (the little bits that make it up) are bouncing around separate from each other. In a solid, the molecules are all connected to each other. In order to change from a liquid to a solid, the molecules have to attach to one another. When a liquid molecule runs into a group of solid molecules, if it's moving slow enough, it will attach to the block, and over time the blocks grow.\n\nIn a \"supercooled\" liquid, the temperature is low enough that the molecules have mostly stopped bouncing around and are ready to connect with one another. But they can't just all attach to each other. If two liquid molecules attach to each other, they're still in the middle of a bunch of liquid molecules, and they'll just get bumped apart again. So they all stay liquid even though they're ready to be solid.\n\nWhat finally causes them to freeze is that they find some other thing to attach to. It could be a crack or bump in the container, or a \"seed\" crystal, or bubbles. It could even be the temporary difference in pressures caused by a noise or tap. Whatever it is, it's a place where molecules can attach to each other without immediately being torn apart by the other molecules. And as soon as enough molecules turn solid, the crystal is too big to be torn apart, so it just keeps growing as more and more molecules bump into it."},

{"title":"{LI5} What does the ''information'' that is supposedly lost, when matter enters a black hole, consist of? ","answer":"So to start with, let's explain why the idea that information would be \"lost\" would be a problem. Imagine that you have a perfect picture of the universe at a given time, right down to the level of subatomic particles. Then there is a principle in quantum mechanics that says that, starting from this picture, you can (in theory) \"run the universe backward.\" It's like saying that if you take a screenshot of one point in a DVD, you can use that to reconstruct the entire movie in just one way.\n\nNow, I'll assume you know that everything in the universe is made up of tiny particles. These particles have properties, like mass and electric charge, that are fundamental, but they also have other properties, like spin, which are not. To simplify, we'll pretend that every subatomic particle has a letter (between A and Z) written on it.\n\nNow, let's talk about black holes. As you probably know, black holes are \"so heavy that light can't escape from them.\" What's more important is that, for a long time, nobody thought *anything* that fell into a black hole could come back. In addition, there's a famous theorem, called the \"no hair theorem,\" that says that any two black holes with the same mass, the same electric charge, and the same spin, look exactly the same. (In other words, black holes don't have different \"hairstyles.\")\n\nNow for the key point. Let's take a particle. We have two choices: we can either write \"A\" on it and throw it into the black hole, or we can write \"Z\" on it and throw it into the black hole. \n\nNow by the no hair theorem, the black hole will look exactly the same afterwards no matter which we do. So if we take a picture of the universe after we throw the particle in the hole, the picture looks exactly the same no matter which letter we wrote on the particle. And therefore, we can't \"rewind the universe\" to before the particle went into the black hole, to see what was written on it! This is (a very simplified version of) the black hole information paradox."},

I go to the payday loan place and they offer to give me $170 now if I give them my whole paycheck when I get it.  I can either take the deal or reject it.\n\n&gt;why there are so bad\n\nThey're not bad.  The interest rates are high, but people accept the terms of the contracts; they know exactly how much the loan is going to cost.  For some people, it's better to get less money now rather than get a full paycheck next week.\n\n&gt;why they still exist\n\nThey are not doing anything illegal.  To get a loan, you have to sign a contract that specifies the interest rate and the fees.  No one gets a loan without signing the contract.  The loan wouldn't take place unless both parties thought it would be beneficial.  To prohibit payday loan places from operating would be to deny people from making their own choices.

Just curious about the physics behind it.","answer":"When you close a door, it's kind of like you're scooping air into the room. That air has to squish up against all the other air that's already in that room, so the door is harder to close. If you have a window or another door open in that room, some of the excess air can leave the room, and there won't be as much pressure on the door."},

Since area is such a nice geometric idea, you can approximate it by breaking it up into smaller, simpler pieces. \n\nThese formula accomplish this, with varying degrees of simplicity and effectiveness. The more complicated the approximation, the more accurate it tends to be. \n\nOn a side note, and in a slightly different direction, this theory can be extended a bit to produce shapes (gaussian quadratures) which actually give the exact areas with no error for simple functions. These are much simpler to compute than the actual integral, as they rely only on a handful of points of the function.\n\nI don't know exactly what problem you're having, but this is the basic idea.

{"title":"ELI5: What is mitochondrial DNA and what it tells about human evolution","answer":"Your DNA comes from both your parents. You have half from your dad and half from your mum.  By the same reasoning, you have 4 grandparents, so you have a quarter of your dna supplied by each of your 4 grandparents. 1/8th from each of your your great grandparents.  It doesn't take many generations before you can go back to a person in your immediate family linage who is no more genetically related to you than a stranger on the street.  Tracing human evolution in this way has a strength and a major weakness for this reason.\n\nImagine we cloned a person based you, umm.. you!  We do it when you are about 30 years old.  They grow up normally, and when they are 30 we clone them again.  Each new generation of you survives the last generation almost like a regular family tree.  The \"son\" of your \"son\" is cloned through many generations, each on almost identical in DNA.  \"Almost\" because DNA mutations still occur.  The cloning process is not perfect, and the odd error gets through.  These errors are usually not a big deal, but since we are cloning the clones of a clone, any mutation is passed on to the next person.  After 10,000 cloned generations, we can look at the dna sequence and compare it to the original (because in my example I still know what the original sequence was) and we can see, lets say, 5 errors.  5 errors in 10,000 generations: we can almost use that as a method of measurement.  \n\nIf my clone has 4 out of the 5 errors of your clone, it suggests that our clones came from the same linage.  It also suggest that the split from the linage was about 1/5 * 10000 generations ago (2000 generations ago).  Someone else has a clone who has 3 out of the 5 errors that your clone has, so it was split off the linage about 4000 generations ago.  I won't go on, but there are some groovy math/stats things you can do with this information.\n\nIf only we had some cloned dna in our cells.  Wait a minute, we DO!  Inside each of your cells is an organelle called a mitochondria.  It has it's OWN dna!  It's not a combination of your mum and dad's, it's a clone of your mums!  We can use this dna sequence just like in the clone example.  Not only that but we can see that almost every living thing on the planet has mitochondria, we can see the genetic distance between everything on the planet.

{"title":"How exactly does stagflation occur?","answer":"Inflation is when prices in general go up. Now, if one 7-11 raises the price of Slurpees, that isn't necessarily inflation. But if all gas stations raise the price of slurpees, and gas, and hot dogs, and things are *generally more expensive*, that's inflation. Usually this happens because customers have money, and people want more hot dogs and things than there are. The price goes up because people are willing to pay more for them. This isn't a bad thing, and it usually happens because lots of people have jobs and have money to spend. A little inflation is normal.\n\nIt can also happen for other reasons. Stagflation is a bad kind of inflation. It happens when there's not enough of something important, like oil. Oil is used for many, many things, so if there's suddenly very little oil, companies can't make as much stuff. If companies can't make as much stuff, they have to fire workers. When people don't have jobs, they have less money. The people who do have money are spending more to get the stuff, so the stuff becomes more expensive.\n\nSo now there are a lot of people with not much money, and stuff is more expensive than before. Companies have a hard time making enough stuff with less money, so stagflation is very hard to get out of.\n\n[Here's an article from Simple Wikipedia](http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagflation)."},

{"title":"ELI5: What is structuralism?","question_detail":"Or the difference between structralism and post structuralism","answer":"The 20th century blasts off with Modernity’s entry as influential processes of thought in all aspects of thinking in the western world. With this introduction comes a new, empiric, cold and distanced gaze; a gaze previously reserved the natural sciences which now turns this gaze inwards with a new set of eyes; with renewed zeal Man starts to review himself, pick himself apart and examine all aspects of ourselves.\n\nThis is why it is perhaps possible to say that everything in the 20th century starts with LANGUAGE. \n\nIf language is anything, it is above all social. Language is the practice of being a human being living in a social group, a small town, a nation, a world community. And when talking about language in general, as constitutive of a society, or as a tool to define a more formal group of users, we’re talking about *discourse.*\n\nDiscourse lets people share a set of understandings about specific aspects of the world.\n\nBroadly defined structuralism is an approach to human activity that sees this activity as analyzable in terms of relational networks. Ergo, objects get meaning from the positions they have in this network.\n\nWhat is Structuralism?\n\n-\tPhilosophic / Sociologic / Anthropologic movement that became prominent in the late fifties / early sixties (especially in France) and peaked in the late sixties.\n-\tDirect successor to Existentialism, was a cool, detached, objective, anti-historical perspective.\n-\tSpecialized in linguistic analysis of social \"codes,\" versus the frantic subjectivity and romanticism of the existentialists.\n-\tWas a method which, in spite of linguistic roots, could be used everywhere and thus surpass specialization.\n-\tApplied in such varied fields as anthropology, literary criticism, sociology and psychology.\n\nThe Structuralist approach stresses interpretations which emphasize that human actions are guided by beliefs and symbolic concepts, and that these have underlying thought structures that are expressed in different forms. The proper orientation of structuralist studies is to identify thought-structures and to study their influence in shaping meaning.\n\nIf linguistic and social structures precede the individual, it also means that consciousness is not the place where the individual is established - it rather means that there are deeper social, linguistic and mental structures that act through us. This means in turn that the notion that man creates his own story through acting, is an illusion. Behind human actions are the structures that set the framework for our thoughts and actions. \n\nWe can then talk about some basic principles:\n\n-\tSocial and cultural phenomena don’t have essences, but rather are defined by their internal structure (the relationship between the system’s components) and their relationships with other relevant social / cultural phenomena.\n\n-\tIsolates factors that are important to a culture as opposed to others (eg the length of a skirt versus color. One is socially insignificant).\n\n\n-\tBy identifying features of how different objects / entities (eg an article) is a sign / symbol, structuralism tries to reveal the system of implicit conventions / rules that are the basis of members of a particular culture.\n\n-\tAttempts to explain how social institutions, ie systems consisting of conventions, can only be discussed or explained through structural analysis. This again, is the basis of human experience. Underlying systems with their special rules make it possible to write a poem, score a goal, be perceived as rude, etc.\n\n-\tStructural explanations do not track temporal events and their precursors and connect them together in a linear causal chain. They rather explain why a particular object or action has a given meaning by relating it to underlying norms and categories (ie a tie).\n\n-\tStructuralism replaces a diachronic perspective (the analysis of a system that is \"frozen\" at a given time) with a synchronous one (rather emphasizes change over time), and stresses three factors:\n\n1.\tStructuralism is less concerned with what might have caused a particular phenomenon at a particular time, but is rather interested in conditions which make it appropriate and important.\n\n2.\tStructural explanations are based on the assumption of the notion of the unconscious. Example: I know a language, ie I can speak and understand speech, but I'm not fully aware of the complex grammatical system I use - most of it is actually out of reach for me and has not even been fully described by linguists. The linguist's task is therefore to describe the dynamics of the unconscious system as evident in my linguistic behavior. Structuralism is therefore in great debt to Freud and Marx, who built their theories on the analysis of the underlying systems.\n\n3.\tSince structuralism explains meaning in terms of systems that escapes the user’s conscious actions, it is therefore inclined to treat the individual's conscious actions as effects rather than causes. The self or subject is not given, but is rather a product of socio-cultural systems.\n\nEffects of Structuralism\n\n-\tStructuralism’s anti-humanism stands in stark contrast with other intellectual thoughts: humanity as a concept is \"abolished\" as a social invention finally revealed. History is just a process without subjects, where its structures have been imposed on people through \"hidden mechanisms\" that forces them to think in certain ways. The author is therefore irrelevant to the study of a work.\n\n-\tStructuralism’s scientific certainty provided the basis for a collection of several social science disciplines such as art, literature and popular culture. It contributed a strong link that bound specialized and fragmented fields together.\n\n-\tStructures are derived from an a priori logic in every human mind: the world has meaning because we equip it with one.\n\n-\tAlthough structuralism began in linguistics it has been extended to fields such as anthropology, psychoanalysis, literary theory, architecture, and its use as method can be applied to all fields or disciplines with emphasis on scientific methods.\n\nOK, but how is this relevant to us and our time?\n\n-\tIntroduced determinism as a significant intellectual problem: you are forced to ask yourself if you believe in free will or not.\n\n-\tProvides further understanding of Modern Thought and why historical ideologies are so different today. Structuralism’s death marked the turning point of modernity.\n\n-\tExamines the full range of The Object vs. The Subject.\n\n-\tWarns us that we are limited by language and vocabulary, and may inspire us to learn new languages. There are no synonyms, every word has its own distinct nuances that distinguish it from others.\n\n-\tPromotes awareness that everything has symbolic value; each thing represents several things and it is the chain of those that lead to symbolic structures.\n\nThis was long, hope it helps.\n\n\n"},
{"title":"ELI5: File Compression, .ZIP, .RAR, etc.","answer":"I'm actually doing a course on data compression at the moment :D\n\nIn addition to dictionary-based compression (as AnteChronos describes below), there are actually lots of ways to compress data. \n\nOne of the most common is Huffman coding. \n\nOrdinarily, characters take eight bits each to transmit - just enough information to hold any one of the 256 different values a char can hold. (let's ignore unicode and such for now). \n\nHowever, some characters tend to be a lot more common than other characters, depending on the kind of file you're looking at. So Mr. Huffman back in 1952 came up with a harebrained scheme that actually works: use much shorter bit-patterns for the most common characters, and longer ones for the rare ones. It's a little fiddly, as you can't use just any old codes - but follow the algorithm and you can get significant savings. \n\nOr then there's run-length encoding, where if you have a bunch of the same character in a row, you specify the character once, followed by the number of repeats - so instead of storing \"YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!\", you store the equivalent of \"YES26!\", which can save a whole lot of space as well. \n\nThere's even a bit of arcane magic called the Burrows-Wheeler transform, which imposes a partial (and reversable!) sort on a file, greatly increasing the number of repeated characters, thus greatly improving the savings that run-length encoding can attain. \n"},

{"title":"ELI5: Why is the front of a bus flat, as opposed to the pointed fronts of cars?","answer":"1. Visibility.

Vital for crowded streets. Allows larger glass areas, too.\n\n2. Space efficiency. Self-explanatory I would think.\n\n3. Aerodynamics. As in, they're not really important on a commuter bus, which never goes fast enough for wind resistance to be a factor (it increases as a square of speed, so at high speeds it is incredibly important).  Tour buses are more streamlined but still at around 70mph wind resistance is only a moderate issue.\n\n4. Ease of construction. Fewer panels.\n\n5. Shorter wheelbase (wheels under-behind the driver), for tighter turns.\n\nIf you get in a modern car, especially after a 60s car, you will find you can barely see out of the freaking thing.

{"title":"ELI5: Why do I get random boners? (Possibly NSFW/NSFL)","answer":"Because you're a man! Unlike women, men require a momentary change in their physical state (boners) in order to reproduce. A woman can be impregnated whether or not she's in the right mood, it's just quite a lot nicer for both parties if she is. A guy can't really do it if he isn't. Thus, nature made it so that men get in that mood very readily and frequently so as to best encourage the survival of the species, but that wasn't quite as crucial of a feature in women since they could \"function\" without it. \n\nWe've all heard the cliché where women require the right planetary alignment in order to be turned on while men just need to be alive, but there's some truth to that. In fact, it is theorized that rape once played a part in our nature and that the reason men's sexual urges are sometimes so aggressive is so they'll try very hard to \"reproduce\" even if the women aren't terribly keen on it. \n\nThat's not very useful anymore, humanity isn't going to perish because the women in the local area aren't as interested in the horizontal dance (I find this to be the case far too often!), but it was an evolutionary consideration back when there were only a few dozen thousands of us in the whole world, and so the instinct unfortunately remains in some men the same way some are instinctually terrified of snakes even if there's rather little chance of dying from snakebites in London or Tokyo. Anyway, you get random boners because that was helpful in ensuring the survival of the human race a very long time ago."},

{"title":"ELI5: Zipf's Law","question_detail":"Can't get my head around this law to do with natural language processing. Tried reading and re-reading Wikipeida's explanation several times and still understand it no better. Can anybody help me out? ","answer":"Basically, Zipf noticed something really interesting in the frequencies of words.\n\nHere's the basic observation. If we look at a given text--let's say *Moby Dick*, we find that the the most frequent word is *the*, and it occurs 13,721 times. The second-most frequent word is *of*, and it occurs 6,536 times. The third-most frequent word is *and*, and it occurs 6,024 times. If we keep going all the way down to the *hapax legomenon* (words which only appear once in the text), we find that these more or less form a straight line ([see this chart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Moby_Dick_Words.gif)).\n\nThis straight line shows the inversely proportional relation of the frequency of the word to the rank of the word. This means that the higher a word's rank is, the higher it's frequency is.\n\nSo we would expect a word that is ranked ~~25th~~ 8th to be less frequent than a word that is ranked 1st. In *Moby Dick*, this is indeed the case. The 1st-most frequent word is *the*, with 13,721 occurrences. And the ~~25th-~~ 8th-most frequent word is *him* (off of my rough estimate), with 1,058 occurrences.\n\nZipf found that this doesn't just hold true for *Moby Dick*, it holds true for any sizeable text (or corpus) we would want to look at (the Bible, the script of *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*, etc.). And it isn't just in English, either. As far as we've found, it holds true across all languages.\n\nHowever, it isn't perfect. Very small texts usually don't work very well, but we'd be talking about *really* small text. In my own personal corpus of Ainu, I have about 8,531 tokens (1,779 unique words), yet Zipf's law appears to hold true.\n\nAnother issue is in the lower tail--that is, the very infrequent words--Zipf's law also doesn't hold. The distribution is no longer linear and sort of flattens out. But this is to be expected, since we can only have integer values and positive numbers of attestations. \n\nAnd finally, we don't know *why* this is true. Which is interesting.\n\nUnfortunately, my stats are awful, so you'll have to ask somebody else if you want to know more about the math which explains the tail.\n\n**EDIT** Keep looking at the graph. It's linear. That's basically what Zipf's point was. The graph and I disagree with the frequency of *him*. It depends on if *-'s* is a word and junk. \n\nAnd if anyone was wondering where I got my counts from, I used [NLTK](http://nltk.org/) for some quick and dirty stats."},

{"title":"ELI5 atomic bombs","question_detail":"what makes them go off? what is inside of them?","answer":"First of all, basically we can fuse small elements to release energy and create bigger elements, and we can split really big (and unstable) elements into smaller elements, also releasing energy. We need both of these processes for an atomic bomb.\n    \nA basic atomic bomb has 3 levels.\n\nExplosive outer core. When this detonates it squeezes the inner core, think of squeezing a small rubber ball in your hand. \n\nThe inner core has two pieces, all the way inside is a small \"hydrogen pellet\" and that is surrounded by a uranium shell.\n\nWhen the ball is squeezed, the pressure is so high the pellet fusses and that releases a bunch of neutrons. The neutrons are like little bullets and fire outwards from the very inside of the inner core to the outer uranium shell.\n\nThis is when all the magic happens. If you can get enough uranium into a small enough space, called a *critical mass*, and if you can get some neutrons flying around... the neutrons will hit the uranium atoms and split them. This will release even more neutrons which will hit more near-by atoms.\n\nAs long as you have a critical mass and you have some neutrons flying around you can start the *chain reaction*. The squeezing of the rubber ball by the explosive outer layer serves two purposes, it creates the critical mass by squeezing the uranium, but it also, and this is very important, squeezes the hydrogen pelllet and fusses it, that fusion releases some neutrons and starts the chain reaction in the critical mass.\n\nThe original explosion of the outer layer does not create enough energy to split atoms, that takes neutrons fired like bullets, so the tiny \"hydrogen pellet\" is used as a fusion trigger to start the chain reaction of splitting atoms.\n\nThat is a basic atomic bomb.\n\nA hydrogen bomb, uses this process to create a bunch of energy but instead of merely a small \"hydrogen pellet\" a much larger source is used. When the outward atomic blast from the spitting atoms happens that also causes an opposite reaction of intense squeezing and the larger source of hydrogen is fused and with clever geometry and amazing blast many many many times stronger than an atomic bomb can be created.

{"title":"ELI5: How people are injured by bombs?","question_detail":"I don't quite get how bombs are actually deadly. I understand that people can get thrown up in the air or against walls and be injured but what moves them? Shock waves? How? Is it the actual metal parts of the bomb exploding like shrapnel that can harms? Does dropping a bomb from an aircraft make it more powerful?","answer":"Firstly bombs have fuel which burns, so you get lots of heat. (You actually land up with two of these blast waves from most explosions, but I won't go into that)\n\nBomb fuels are specially chosen to let off a ridiculously large amount of gas in a very small amount of time, which is in a very compact area. The gas needs to get out, and it does so very quickly. Too quickly in fact, because all the other gas that was made by the bomb is pushing it away. The gas is pushed so hard that it is forced to move faster than it normally can, and this forms a blast wave (which is similar to a shock wave, but with minor technical differences that I won't get into here). You can think of a blast wave as an instant change in wind speed. One second the air is still, and then the next second you have a wind blowing at several hundred miles an hour. Remember that this wind is very hot, because it comes directly out of burning fuel. \n\nCarried by the wind, you have the metal bits from the bomb (shrapnel), but also dust and sand and bits of everything else that was between you and the bomb. That works like sand paper, and basically just rips your skin. Don't forget that this skin is probably already quite badly burned from the really hot wind.\n\nThen you get your body's own reaction. The blast wave isn't stopped by your body. Your body is soft and squishy and the the wave has no problem passing through your organs. Your organs don't like that, and it's not unusual for one of them to tear or burst. Your bones are solid though, and the blast wave and put up quite a bit of resistance to the shock wave. The shock wave pushes back, and often one or two bones can't take that pushing and snap. Your body is pushed backwards really quickly, and often your brain hits the inside of your skull, which can cause major damage.\n\nOccasionally, the wind can lift you and throw you around, but that's not normally the main cause of damage.\n"},

Here's what I remember from Geography of Developing Nations class:\n\nDuring the European colonization of Africa in the 1800's, European countries like France and Germany explored and staked claim to large areas of Africa, even though there were relatively advanced civilizations living there. Europeans began to harvest these resources and use them to turn a high profit or sustain wars at home. \n\nBelgium was kind of late to the party. They got a foothold in Congo and started looking for resources they could use/sell. The main one was rubber. Rubber vines were a source for latex to be used in textiles and machinery. Artificial latex would not be discovered until WWII. The European colonists forced the native people to collect (often) unreasonable amounts of rubber sap from the forests or face mutilation (hands, feet chopped off, people killed, entire villages burned). \n\nThis went in for many years, even after most European countries pulled out of Africa. Finally, Belgium allowed Congo to become its own nation, but at that point things were pretty much wrecked. I don't know much about the more recent history of civil war and such, but most of the instability is due to abuse at the hands of colonists and their subsequent pull out, leaving a country with no leadership and a horrible, horrible past to deal with."},
{"title":"ELI5 the impact of the European fiscal treaty on Ireland ","question_detail":"What will the impact be (both positive and negative) for Ireland for both the yes vote and the no vote?","answer":"A yes vote means that Ireland, like the rest of Europe, is slowly moving toward a federation. Basically Euro countries don't have monetary sovereignty, which means they have no national control over their currency, as we do in America with the Federal Reserve. With the fiscal treaty they will give up fiscal sovereignty, which means for some things people who aren't Irish will make decisions on how your government will spend money. \n\nA no vote is a little hectic. It puts you on the path to leaving the Euro, and it makes the entire zone less stable. It does mean, however, that your nation retains more sovereignty. The problem is that the Euro has demonstrated an inability to deal with a crisis, and the two most likely outcomes of this are 1. A federated Europe and 2. A complete collapse of the euro, retention of national sovereignty, and an even more dramatic global economic crisis. "},

{"title":"ELI5: Why do gifs take longer to load than a video?","answer":"To show a moving picture you needs a bunch of individual pictures all shown after another.

They have all kinds of tricks so that less information is needed to make the 30 needed for the clip.  A really important one is starting with one full picture and then only describing how that one is changed.  Since the images usually look pretty similar from one instant to the next this means much less than a full 30 pictures is needed.\n\nFor example if you wanted a 30 picture clip of me browsing reddit in a modern video you would only need to change the part that is my hand and eyes moving.

{"title":"ELI5: How torrents work.","answer":"Like your 5 (and by that I mean I'm giong to draw a metaphor):\n\nThere are three kinds of downloading.  Downloading from server that allows multiple connections, Peer to Peer, and BitTorrent.\n\nLet's start with Peer to Peer and use the copying and transfer of puzzle pieces as our example.  You and your friend Katie both have have \"Super Transfer Tube 4000\"s.  Each STT4 has 10 connection ports that allow you to connect to other STT4s.  8 of those tubes are inputs, and you can get 8 different things at a time.  That's pretty cool because that's a lot of things.  The other 2 tubes are outputs, so you can send stuff to other people.  Also, these tubes only can handle one thing per second if they're being used (much much slower than the internet but, stick with me).  Following so far?\n\nAlright, lets move on.  Katie has a puzzle she made that she wants to send to you.  It's a 100 piece puzzle.  Katie connects her two output tubes to two of your input tubes so you can transfer all 100 pieces in 50 seconds (2 pieces per second).\n\nNow to Server Downloads:  Katie's puzzle has become really popular.  Reginald, who just got a STT 7000 (which has 10 input tubes and 10 output tubes!) gets a copy.  Now, if one person is connecting to Reginald, they can connect all 8 of their input tubes to his output tubes and get the puzzle in about 12 seconds.  But if two people want to download from Reginald, they can only connect 5 tubes each and get the puzzle in 20 seconds.  Still better than the original 50 seconds though.  So everyone can get it faster than the original peer to peer download.\n\nHOLD EVERYTHING:  Now there's this new \"Super Transfer Switcher Box\" that's just come out and can connect you to any STT that's been registerd.  The STSB takes as many of your input tubes as you want it to take, and it takes as many output tubes as it you want it to take (probably say 7 inputs, and 1 output so that you still have one of each free to play with your other friends).  So now you go register your STT4 with the STSB and tell it that you want to have a copy of Lindsey's puzzle.  The STSB looks at all of the other STTs connected and finds 7 connected outputs from others STTs and it connects their outputs to your inputs.  Now you can get Lindsey's puzzle in 15 seconds.  At the same time somebody else is getting Lindsey's puzzle from you.  The beneifit here is that, you can almost always be sure that you'll have 7 connections because there are a lot of people on the STSB and if each one gives at least one output tube, you're almost guaranteed to have the most number of tubes connected.\n\n----\nExplanation\n\nBitTorrent revolves around the fact that as a subscriber to an internet service provider, you almost always have a ton more download bandwidth than you have upload bandwidth.  In peer to peer downloads, you can only download as fast as your peer can upload, so it's not very fast.  In server downloads, you can count on a server to have paid more to their ISP for better upload speeds since that's what they primarily do but, they're still throttled because you can only connect to what they have to spare for each user trying to get data from them.\n\nIn bit torrent applcations though, you connect to multiple people so you can get the file in small parts from person A, person B, and person C at the same time.  Since  you can do it at the same time, the bottleneck of person A having a really bad upload connection isn't nearly as limiting because you can always connect to person D and get a small bit from them to.  This lets the bottle neck be how fast your download speed is instead of how fast someone elses upload speed is.\n\n----\nAnywho, I hope you found my metaphor to be somewhat amusing and I hope it helped explain thigns a little bit.  I also hope that you, or someone else, can take away something from the more technical explanation."},

Am I suppose to do it in my head, or on paper, or is there some place online I can use to draw the actual lines for the graphing part? Thanks!","answer":"Start by understanding what a function is. A function is a process you apply to one number to get another number. If you change the starting number, you get a different answer. Some functions are very simple, others can be very complex.\n\nOften, you call the input number of a function ‘x’, and the output number of a function ‘y’. So we could start with the most basic function: x=y. So when x is 1, y is 1. And when x is 2, y is 2. Or we could have the function 2x=y. So when x is 2, y is 4. These are very simple functions. Another famous kind of function is quadratic functions, which can be written as ax^2 + bx + c = y, and it depends on the problem what values should be used for a, b and c.\n\nA graph can be used to work with functions very easily, because you have two axes — one for the input, and one for the output. For each value on the x axis, there is a corresponding y value, which is the output of the function. So for instance, for the function x=y, the graph looks like a straight diagonal line, because whatever value you choose as x is mirror as the value for y. However, a function like x^2 = y looks like a curved line, because the y value gets steadily bigger (the y values go 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49 etc). This is really useful, because now if you're given a value for x, you can just use a ruler to follow along from that x value until you reach the line of the graph, and then use a rule again to read across to find the value for y.\n\nYou can plot graphs on paper, using some calculators (if you have a smart phone, there are some great graphing calculator apps around), or on some web-based calculators like Wolfram Alpha. Practice plotting some simple functions on paper so you get the hang of it (try plotting 3x+1=y as your first one), but when you get on to more complex functions, no one will mind if you use a calculator, so long as you're able to understand and explain it."},

For other things it might be bad. If I'm not mistaken, companies like Coca Cola, KFC, etc don't have patents and instead keep their products as \"trade secrets\".

All of the cogs were spinning despite being in difference gears and that confused me.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftdgB93QOD8","answer":"Think of a gearbox like a bicycle drivetrain but directly connected instead of with a chain.  It's basically a one big cog at a time connected to another smaller gear to create a gear ratio.  On your bike, if you're in a big gear at the front and a small gear at the back, it's really hard to pedal slowly but you can go really fast.  If you're in a small gear in front and big gear in back then it's easier to pedal but you (or the engine) have to spin too high to move faster.\n\nYour video doesn't do a good job of showing it, but when you (or the car) switches between gears, it's sliding the various available ratios (4 speed, 5 speed, etc.) into service and connecting them with the output shaft.  The gearshift in a manual car acts sort of like derailleurs on your bike, pushing the correct gears together so that your ratio is changed.\n\nA clutch is just a connection between the engine (flywheel) and the wheels (by way of the transmission).  It's two (or more) plates that clamp together by a big spring.  In a manual car, the clutch pedal is simply a lever that separates these two disks.  You have to engage it smoothly and slip it a bit in order to get moving but after that it just stays essentially linked together.\n\nAn automatic transmission has a torque converter which is basically just a fluid connection between the engine and the transmission.\n\nAs for which to get?  Automatic.  They usually don't cost more these days and they're long figured out the maintenance issues of the old days.  Modern computers have made gear selection much better than it used to be.  Some cars also have sport/performance modes as well and even economy modes.\n\nThe only exception when you should buy a manual would be if you were buying a sports car that you won't be commuting in or something vintage that you want to work on yourself."},

{"title":"ELI5: What is the difference between an LCD and LED TVs. ","question_detail":"And which is better for simply watching TV/movies?\nThanks!","answer":"The only difference between an LCD and LED TV is the backlight. Both kind are actually LCD TVs, and both use the *exact same* LCD panels (that part that controls how much light gets through each pixel).\n\nLCD TVs use cold-cathode fluorescent backlights arranged as a bunch of bars (imagine your standard drop-ceiling tubes but smaller). There are several layers behind the LCD to diffuse the light evenly and re-align it so that light can pass through the LCD panel nicely. Different companies use drastically different designs for these layers (having pulled apart 7 different manufacturers, I've seen 7 different designs), but they get the same job done - make the light produced by the backlight nice and even and bright.\n\nLED TVs use an array of LEDs instead of a bunch of bars of CCFLs. This produces light with a better color distribution (LEDs have more curvy spectrums rather than spiky spectrums that CCFLs have). Another key thing is the controllability of the backlight to create better color.\n\nWith CCFL backlights, you have one brightness for the entire TV, and the only way you can change the brightness of each individual pixel is to change the pixel on the LCD panel itself. With the LEDs, however, you have local regions of backlight (usually around 3 or 4 inches square) that you can control as well. So if you really want the blackest of blacks, you can just turn off the backlight as well as the LCD panel pixels. Of course, in movies, not every pixel in one of those regions of completely black, so you do have to keep the backlight on a little bit, but the circuitry in the TV compensates for the lower backlight by increasing the amount of light the bright pixels in that region let through.\n\nIt creates another method to control how much light the pixels put out, and because of that dynamic backlight that LED TVs can offer, it generally produces a slightly better picture. Note that manufacturers like Vizio use very old designs, and although they may have the same specs as more expensive TVs, they are not built as well nor do they have the adequate complexity or computing power to create the same quality picture as an \"equivalent\" LG, Samsung, or Pioneer TV.\n\nAlso note that some LCD TVs advertise a dynamic backlight as well, but because one single bulb provides the backlight for a very wide column of pixels, the actual controllability isn't nearly as good. They may have the same contrast ratio of an LED TV, but that can only happen when all of the pixels in that very large region are the same brightness (which usually never happens)."},

The intention of the law was to give law enforcement increased powers in search and seizure so as to close a supposed loop-hole in law enforcement that allowed terrorists to hide in plain site. However, privacy advocates argue that the expansion of law enforcement powers violates the 4th and 5th amendments, and should be dismantled (or at a minimum, certain provisions should be allowed to expire).\n\nThe most notable quote against the law is from former Congressman Dennis Kucinich, who voted against the law.

{"title":"ELI5: how does Adderrol work?","answer":"Your brain is made up of a whole bunch of different parts, all working together. \n\nOne of these parts sorts the important things to think about from the rest, so you can concentrate on what you're doing, instead of getting distracted by every single thing you see. \n\nSome people have a condition called ADHD, where this part works too slowly and gets tired easily, and can't keep up with all the unimportant sights, sounds and thoughts that it's meant to be filtering out. \n\nBecause of this, ADHD people *are* constantly distracted by silly little things that don't matter, because they can't help thinking about them instead, and forgetting what they were doing before. It also means they get bored super-quickly if they have to sit and do just one thing. \n\nNow, Adderal, Ritalin and a bunch of other medicines given to ADHD people are called *stimulants* - they make the brain go faster and have more energy. \n\nIf you give ADHD people just a little bit of these stimulants, it lets that slow, tired part of their brain get faster and more energetic, so it can keep up with all the stuff it sees and thinks about, and properly sort out the useful thoughts from all the other passing junk.\n"},
{"title":"ELI5: Why is marijuana illegal?","question_detail":"I know this could end up in a huge debate but I just don't get what the reasons are that it's illegal. I think our country could tax it and benefit tremendously from it.","answer":"It's a rather complex issue in terms of reasoning, but an easily explained one - there's just a lot behind it. It's more about the history behind marijuana (cannabis) than the drug's actual effects. I'll point out the main reasons without going into too much depth. If you aren't much for reading, here's a great documentary on the subject: [The Union: The Business Behind Getting High](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HLzmH9VB6A)\n\nImmigration/Race-\nDuring the early 1900s, the US became even more anti-immigrant than before. \"Marijuana\" was popular among Mexicans and African-Americans. Making it illegal provided an excuse to arrest, deport, or encourage people to leave.\n\nAlcohol- \nIn the past as well as during modern times, the alcohol industry has been very much against recreational use of cannabis for obvious reasons. They pour significant amounts of money into anti-marijuana lobbying every year.\n\nClothing and Paper Manufacturing-\nPerhaps the greatest reason for marijuana being made illegal in the first place is due to the influence of the lumber and textile industries. Hemp, when used as a fiber can be used quite efficiently to produce paper or cloth. \n\nPolice and Prison Spending- \nThe US spends very large amounts of money on prisons and on police funding. If cannabis were to be made legal for recreational use, prisons and police departments (particularly the large ones) would receive less funding. As a number of prisons in the US are privately-owned, their owners find that lobbying against legalization is a great way to protect their businesses. If marijuana is made legal, suddenly there's significantly less people being locked up, which means profits being cut almost entirely. Look up statistics as to how many people are locked up for marijuana related offenses, you'll be unpleasantly surprised.\n\nThe Governments Historical Position- \nThe government, having taken the stance for many years that cannabis is a dangerous substance is unwilling to change its position. In addition, the position held by the government for all those years has led many Americans to believe that cannabis is a dangerous substance. Programs like D.A.R.E hinder progress as a society and create anti-legalization groups who will always vehemently oppose any attempts to legalize drugs of any kind. \n\nIn conclusion-\nAs I said before, there's a lot to it. I could write a book on the subject and not feel satisfied with my explanation. If you've got any questions though feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer. "},
{"title":"ELI5: How taste buds work","answer":"Back in the days of early human evolution (before humans even, but let's simplify this), some poor fellow found out that eating that black mushroom growing in the grass made him really sick and ended up killing him a few days later. This kept happening until human evolution started associating the taste of that mushroom as \"bad\". Now, what's bad? It's all relative, but, generally, if it's not good for you, it tastes bad. The chemical composition of the mushroom became associated with death, aka bad. \n\nThe opposite holds true for things that are healthy for you. Bee honey is a great energy source and always bacteria free (when it isn't mixed in with water or other liquids), so it tastes good to us.\n\nBut how do we taste? Think back to chemical compositions of certain foods. Chemicals that are capable of binding to the taste receptors on the tongue bind and send signals to the brain. That food then is given a \"taste\". Later health consequences of that food are taken into account by suggestion (I'll explain this in a bit), and the body determines the taste of that food as good or bad. \n\nNow, suggestion is the same thing as the mushroom example, but it's not *always* clear cut. If you eat something and it makes you sick everytime you eat it, the brain will associate the taste of that food as repulsive. But, let's say you eat something that's bad for you and then have the best sex of your life. You might get a headache from eating the food, but if you have mind blowing sex everytime right afterwards, your body will actually find that food good (not in all cases, but you get the idea). \n\nThere are also some foods that are incapable of binding to the tongue, even if they're bad for you, so you never associate that taste as bad. And even then, some foods might taste bad, but they kill you so quickly, you and your later generations never find the taste of that food bad until certain mutations or a stroke of luck let a few people survive their encounter with that food. \n\nThis little bit is also interesting. People can *force* themselves to hate unhealthy food by associating certain foods with bad thoughts, feelings, or effects. You can even try this yourself. If you're unhealthy or just curious, you can take a bar of chocolate, and, before eating it, think of the most depressing moment in your life. That might be a bit dark, but you can also look at a picture of something disgusting whilst eating the chocolate. Your brain will end up associating the chocolate with something horrible, even though the chocolate itself might not be, and \"give\" the chocolate a repulsive taste (just like the mushroom example). This could take a while, but it does definitely work. "},

Nothing is making sense, and the mainstream media are the last ones I'd consult for factual information about the Middle East.\n\nAre we witnessing a replay of World War I here?","answer":"I couldn't find a source for the other Arab countries backing each other, but Egypt and Iraq are not in much condition to back Syria militarily. Most likely they are trying to pressure Turkey from acting too aggressively toward Syria while Russia is trying to downplay its support for the Assad regime. Most likely this was an accident because Turkish jets often skirt its southern border, and Syrian artillery shoots first and asks questions later because when Israeli jets will bomb Syrian artillery if they detect it as being active (and a Syrian official said it is possible they though it was an Israeli jet).\n\nNo country wants to intervene in Syria fearing a repeat of the foreign intervention in the Lebanese Civil War, in which popular support fell after US and French peacekeepers were killed in a terrorist attack. Turkey already did not like Assad, so now it has an excuse to put more pressure on the regime. Most likely the outcome will be Turkey arming its border and giving more supplies, possibly weapons, to the rebels."},

Usually, snot keeps it moist and soft, but in the summer the heat can dry out your nose, making the skin more vulnerable to damage and bleeding. Often, this is due to conditions being \"dry\". Some people get more bleeds in the winter when the humidity is usually lower (depends on where you life). Also, if you have allergies to things in the summer like grad and pollen, it can inflame the surface in the nose and make it more likely to bleed. \n\nIt sounds like you should see a doctor. A bleed like that might mean you have a large blood vessel near the surface of the inside of your nose. Doctors can fix this problem by sealing off that vessel (my sister had this happen). "},

Zoom far enough into any image and you'll start seeing them. Resolution refers to how many of these pixels are, and is so named because the more pixels there are making up an image, the more detail there is to *resolve*. It's like mosaic artwork -- you can make a really abstract representation of someone out of 200 tiles, but you'll need thousands and thousands to make a recognisable portrait.\n\n[I made this animated GIF to better explain how resolution impacts detail.](http://i.imgur.com/WzJgr.gif) You can see that the version with only 2709 pixels is basically unrecognisable, and that the more pixels are added, the more detail you can see. The numbers denote the resolution, which is commonly written Width-x-Height -- 500x200 means the image is a grid 500 pixels wide and 200 pixels high, making it 100,000 pixels total.\n\n*HD* stands for *high definition*, and is a non-technical term denoting any video signal with more than 1280x720 resolution. This is what's used for most HDTV, and it's around three times the detail of DVDs and non-HD television. You'll also see the term *full HD* or *1080p*, which means 1920x1080 or 2.1 million pixels. This is what's used on Blu-rays and some internet streams, and it's twice HDTV, or six times regular TV/DVD.\n\nA *megapixel* is one million pixels. If a camera says it's 32 megapixels, that means it can create images that each contain up to around 32,000,000 pixels. They use this term, rather than X-Y measurements like \"500x200\", because they can capture images in a variety of aspect ratios.\n\nVery commonly-used resolutions are often labelled according to their height. Examples are 720x480 (480p/i, or standard definition TV/DVD in USA and Japan), 720x576 (576p/i, standard definition TV/DVD in Australia and Europe), 1280x720 (720p, HDTV), 1920x1080 (1920p/i, some HDTV or Bluray), or 2K, 4K, 6K and 8K (used in digital cinema/high-end cameras).\n\nWhen you pick a resolution on Youtube and see 360, 480, 720, etc, that's what those numbers mean.\n\nThe *aspect ratio* refers to the shape of the frame. You've noticed that new \"widescreen\" TVs are a different shape than the old TVs -- that's a change in aspect ratio, from square to wider. When you watch an old TV show and it has black bars on the left and right of your TV, or you watch a new movie and it has black bars on the top and bottom, that's because the TV show or movie was filmed in a different aspect ratio to your television set.\n\nTelevision sets usually note their aspect ratio as either *4:3* -- meaning that for every 4 centimetres of width they have, they have 3 of height -- or *16:9*. Old square-ish TVs are 4:3, new widescreens are 16:9. Media, however, always denotes its aspect ratio according to :1. 2:1 media would be an image exactly twice as wide as it is high.\n\n[Here's an image I made demonstrating the different aspect ratios in common use.](http://i.imgur.com/xuPvU.png)\n\nWhen the aspect ratio of what you're watching doesn't match the aspect ratio of your television set, you're either left with unused space on your screen (because a square doesn't completely fill a rectangular hole) or you zoom in on the image to cut off the edges (called 'pan and scan').\n\nHDMI and VGA refer to the way signals are encoded to pass from your computer, DVD/Bluray player, Play Station, etc to your TV set, and the cables designed for those signals. They all operate in different ways. VGA is the old-timey analogue signal; the chips on your computer decode your video into signals about how red, green, and blue (the colours that make up all other colours) different parts of your image are, feeds them through a VGA cable to your monitor, and says \"Here, display this.\" HDMI, or High Definition Media Interface, actually just transmits the raw video *and audio* data from your player to your TV, so your TV/monitor can turn it into image information itself. HDMI supports transmitting much more data, which is necessary for HD signals, and will do a much better job than VGA will.\n\nThe other two important details to note in a video are framerate and scanning type. All videos are just made up of lots of still images played back very quickly; each image is a *frame*. A movie is usually 24 frames per second, while TV is 25 or 30 depending on where you are. There are two types of ways to display these frames. The first is in *progressive scan*: you show all of frame 1, then all of frame 2, then all of frame 3. This is how computers and movie projectors work, and how a modern TV setup with a Bluray player and a HDMI cable will work. But the second option is to *interlace* it. This is where you break the image up into rows [like this](http://gagadget.com/files/u1/2010/02/interlace.png). You show the odd rows of frame 1, then the even rows of frame 1, then the odd rows of frame 2, and so on, alternating very quickly, never updating the entire picture at once. This is how old non-LCD/plasma televisions worked, how videotapes work, and how composite cables -- the yellow cable you used to plug in your Nintendo 64 back in the olden days -- work. \n\nYou'll sometimes see videos described as *1080i60* or *720p24*, especially on camera menus. The first number is the height of the resolution. The *p* or *i* refers to *progressive* or *interlaced* mode, and the last number refers to the framerate. So when you see 720p24, you know that it's going to capture a 1280x720 image, it's going to capture the entire image in one go as opposed to dividing it up into sets of rows, and it's going to do it 24 times per second."},

{"title":"Virtualbox, or any VM.  What/why/how?  Thank you","question_detail":"wondering what actually is a virtual machine, what it does, and why it is a good idea.  As someone with no computer science knowledge should I utilize it, or even attempt to?\n\nThank you.","answer":"A virtual machine is just what the name implies.  It's a \"virtual\" machine on your computer.  Say I use Linux as my main operating system.  I can do everything in the world I want to do on Linux except play my favorite game.  I can create a virtual machine on Linux, and install Windows onto that VM.  So now I can be on Linux, and run that virtual machine which has Windows installed.\n\nIt sounds like you really have no need to use a VM.  But if you are interested in doing things like learning other operating systems, you could run a virtual machine on Windows and in that VM install Linux to play with.  You can run a VM in \"windowed\" mode.  So on Windows, you'd have a window like any other application, and in that window would be Linux running.  You could then play around all you wanted with Linux and not have to worry about messing up your Windows install.\n\nAnother use of VMs is in the web server world.  A hosting company could have a bunch of big beefy servers, then each customer gets their own virtual machine on that server.  Say that powerful server can handle 50 VMs.  So 50 customers essentially get their own little server (their own personal VM on the big server) but the hosting company only actually has to own and maintain the 1 piece of hardware."},

After reading about the boroughs here on ELI5, I'm confused about how the subway works, how the streets are numbered, and spots I should probably stay away from after dark. Also - what constitutes downtown, midtown, and uptown?\n\n**TL;DR: http://i.imgur.com/0oRhs.jpg**","answer":"Walking around NYC is fairly easy to navigate. The whole city is pretty much a giant grid.  Avenues travel North to South and the farther East you go, the smaller the Ave # becomes.  The \"Streets\" travel East to West. In contrast to Avenues, the # gets higher the more North you go. \n\nThere are a few diagonal streets and streets with names (i.e. Madison Ave), but they won't throw you off by that much.

{"title":"ELI5: How do judges know how many points to deduct? Why is the top score out of 16? ","question_detail":"They don't really explain the olympic gymnastic deductions precisely which makes me think it's more of a subjective art than a science.","answer":"There is a mathematical approach to answering this question, and better yet, it requires little knowledge of anything to do with the details of how scoring works for a given event.\n\n(For this same reason, I realize that this will not be a very satisfying answer for you. I'm not trolling or anything though, I'm honestly just posting this because I thought you'd find it interesting nonetheless.)\n\nSo, how much of scoring is subjective and how much not? This can be estimated with simple statistics. It would be much, much harder to do if only one judge scored each performance (though still not impossible), but here's the approach I would take.\n\nFor each performance, collect all the scores of all the judges and look at the variations. We know there *must* be some objective criteria for scoring if the scores of all the judges tend to fall within the same range; there's no other explanation if they are not valuing certain elements in the same way.\n\nTo the extent that there is variation in the scores from different judges for the same performance, we can attribute some of that to simple errors. It's possible one judge didn't see an error and gave a slightly higher score than they otherwise would have with perfect observation; likewise, it's possible a judge saw a non-error and accidentally judged it as an error, resulting in a lower score.\n\nAfter collecting enough data to correct for this, you would no doubt still see some variation in scoring from judge to judge. This could be considered the component of the average judge's score that is based on subjective judgments.\n\nHaving said all that, you can get a sense of how scoring works for a particular event by looking up the scoring system used by judges. For example, here is the judging system used for figure skating in the Winter Olympics - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_skating#ISU_Judging_System"},
{"title":"Why are there still ref's in when fencing has fancy electronics?","answer":"Fencing isn't as simple as giving each point to the competitor who isn't stabbed first.  When both players hit each other, priority is given to the player who starts their attacking motion first.  This is often a matter of judgement and has nothing to do with the lights.  For example, if I lunge to hit my opponent, I have priority.  If, however, my opponent blocks my sword and proceeds to hit me, my opponent gets the point even though both of our lights may go on.  (In fencing terminology, blocking the opponent and counterattacking is known as parry and riposte.)  The lights just indicate that the sword has contacted the opponent.  If you watch a match from close-up between quick fencers, you cannot possibly tell if the sword hit someone or missed by an inch.  That being said, decisions need to be made beyond who got hit first.\n\nThe other purpose of the ref is to manage the flow of the match.  Did a player intentionally step out of bounds?  Did a player position his swordless hand in front of his body illegally?  Is a replay needed?  These are questions where a human is needed to make a judgement.  Like most sports, the majority of calls are straightforward, but you always want a person to be there for those calls that aren't as obvious. "},
{"title":"ELI5: high speed trading/quants","question_detail":"OK so computer software makes bulk trades in seconds.  But who is there to acknowledge the trade?\n\n\nEven with my personal credit card, I can make a purchase but it still make days for  them to deduct money from my account.\n\nWith a high speed trade, does the entire transaction happen within seconds?","answer":"High-speed trading is buying a security or derivative (such as a stock) and selling it a few milliseconds later. The trader (who virtually always is a computer programmed to exploit various market inefficiencies [opportunities where asset prices may be slightly off]) typically makes profit on the bid/ask spread, which is the difference between the price at which you can buy the asset and the price at which you can sell it. Lots of hedge funds and other investment groups use high-speed strategies designed to profit in all sorts of scenarios, but because my time is limited I am going to focus on the type of high speed trading that was recently thrown into the spotlight: market making.\n\nMarket makers are brokerage units that provide liquidity in various markets, like the stock market. Liquidity is simply the availability of people to buy or sell an asset; a stock that trades thousands of shares a second is very liquid, while a house (that only sells maybe every 5-10 years) is an illiquid asset. The liquidity common in the stock market is mainly provided by market makers, who engage in mass buying and then rapidly selling (sometimes aller scalping [though not to be confused with the different, illegal practice)] of various stocks. While they may only make a few pennies per transaction, the sheer number of trades being executed (usually through a direct line to the major exchanges or dark pools [alternative places where investors can buy and sell equities off-exchange]) means that market making firms usually make a nice profit.\n\nHowever, a firm called Knight Capital Group (which I imagine has piqued your interest in the subject), recently made a very large mistake. One of the firm's algorithms (basically giant lines of code that tell the computer when to buy and when to sell) went completely haywire after the staff failed to adequately ensure that it would play nicely with a new program the NYSE (an exchange) had recently implemented. Rather than buying low and selling high, the company's computers did the opposite, to comical extremes; the firm began issuing offers to buy various stocks for as much as 200% of their value or to sell them at half off. Savvy traders quickly caught on, and the firm was drained of $440 million in 30 minutes as it made thousands of trades at absurd prices. Now, since that loss is equal to 4x the company's annual income, the firm is struggling to remain afloat and meet its overnight funding operations (although they did recently receive bridge financing that allowed them to survive Friday). I'll save the explanation of shadow banking and financing some other day.\n\n\nEdit:\nSorry, I got a little carried away and failed to answer your question.\n\nThere is no one to validate the trade. The days of stock trades being sent to a guy on the floor of the NYSE are long over: today, virtually all equity trades take place between computers."},

They also merge two companies, or spin-off part of a company (that's all called M&amp;A, or \"mergers and acquisitions\").  Investment banks also do prop trading (making trades with the bank's own money) and asset management (money management for rich people).\n\nPrivate equity firms buy an entire company, fix it up (change management, sell off unprofitable divisions, cut the workforce, etc.), and sell it after a few years.

","answer":"Fiber-optic lines are strands of optically pure glass as thin as a human hair. They are arranged in bundles called optical cables and used to transmit light signals over long distances. Enough of what they are, let's get into how they work.\n\n\nIf you look closely at a single optical fiber, you will see that it has the following parts:\n\n* **Core** - Thin glass center of the fiber where the light travels\n\n* **Cladding** - Outer optical material surrounding the core that reflects the light back into the core\n\n* **Buffer** coating - Plastic coating that protects the fiber from damage and moisture\n\nOptical fibers come in two types:\n\n* **Single-mode fibers**\n\n* **Multi-mode fibers**\n\n\nSingle-mode fibers have small cores and transmit infrared laser light. \n\nMulti-mode fibers have larger cores  and transmit infrared light from light-emitting diodes (LEDs).\n\n\n\nSuppose you want to shine a flashlight beam down a long, straight hallway. Just point the beam straight down the hallway -- light travels in straight lines, so it is no problem. What if the hallway has a bend in it? You could place a mirror at the bend to reflect the light beam around the corner. What if the hallway is very winding with multiple bends? You might line the walls with mirrors and angle the beam so that it bounces from side-to-side all along the hallway. This is exactly what happens in an optical fiber.The light in a fiber-optic cable travels through the core (hallway) by constantly bouncing from the cladding (mirror-lined walls), a principle called **total internal reflection**. Because the cladding does not absorb any light from the core, the light wave can travel great distances.\n\n\nHopefully this helps. :D\n\n"},
{"title":"How come some people are extremely allergic to even tiny amounts of things like shell fish, peanuts, etc.?","answer":"there are specific allergies because there are these specific few groups of proteins that people with allergies have drastic reactions to (explained by the immune system response effect above). generally these allergies are developed at a young age if you are born/raised in a 'relatively clean' place like in developed countries. children born in less sanitized places often are able to develop a better immune system while growing up and so 'peanut butter allergies' and 'shell fish allergies' are less common. that is why when people from developed countries travel to developing countries, they often encounter illnesses very easily as compared to native people. suddenly they are exposed to germs that 'did not exist' in their home country. whereas vice versa is rare because children born in developing countries grow up fighting these illnesses so their immune system is 'used to' it and when they travel to clean environments, they have no problem.

Why can't we use that same concept to enlarge a digital image without it looking pixelated? ","answer":"Well lets say you just shot a roll of film and now you want to develop it. First thing you need to do is crack open the sealed role and take the film out. Once out you role it onto a film real (like a movie camera but smaller) This is a pain because you have to do it in absolute darkness.\n\nNext you put the film through a series of chemical washes for set amounts of time. The chemicals are: Developer, Stopper, and Fixer. They do pretty much what they sound like. Once the baths are done you rinse the film with water and hang it to dry. \n\nFinally once the negative is finished you can have a proper picture made from it. To do this you shine a light through the negative and onto photo paper (paper that is photosensitive similar to film). Then you send the paper through the same chemical washes you used to develop the negative. Hang to dry and done!\n\nThe negative is small yes but it can scale large (up to a point before you get grain).

{"title":"ELI5: The economics of recycling","question_detail":"I have read that recycling, at times, costs more money to do than it brings in (i.e. there is a negative return).  Excluding dangerous garbage (e.g. car batteries) I have always wondered why this sort of thing should not be left up to the market.  \n\nTake plastic for example: after we hit peak oil, oil-based products like plastic will become very expensive.  Wouldn't this mean that the millions of tons of plastic presently in land fills will become valuable and worth harvesting, thus eliminating plastic from landfills in an economic manner?","answer":"there is a Penn &amp; Teller Bullshit! episode on this.  It seems aluminum is about the only material that has a positive ROI to recycle. It's mostly to make us feel good about doing something for the environment.

For someone who is obviously smart (has to be somewhat to be in his position), it seems that the message he is trying to portray is so out there, that you have to ask why? You look at two things with politicians, money and power. Two easily answered questions in todays elections. The candidate and the v.p. are both bought. Which means the motives for power comes from the people who invest in their next president. You don't hear about these things in news today. The people get to see commercials of the candidates bad mouthing each other and given a new speech everyday to try and appeal to the masses. My question is...

{"title":"ELI5: Biological clocks.","question_detail":"I often wake up moments before my alarm or sometimes just \"know\" how much time has passed. How is this and why? How do our \"clocks\" compare with other animals'?","answer":"There is a ~25 hour \"circadian rhythm\", which can be 're-synchronized' with the 24-hour clock as long as you're aware of the time of day. As a result your body's own biochemical cycles can closely follow the change of day into night and even the period of the day, so if you need to wake up at a certain time persumably your brain translates that somehow into something your body's doing at approximately that time, and can wake you up as needed.\n\nAll this can (not *is*, but just *can*) be thrown off if you sleep irregularly, or demand of yourself too little sleep before the next wake time. For example, there's no way I can go to sleep at like 4 AM and really wake up at 6. I invariably find I wake up at 7 or 8. But if I go to bed around midnight or earlier, I have no problem waking up nice and early. :)\n\nAll the above is not backed by rigorous scientific study, so if anyone has journal articles on the subject feel free to back me up or shoot me down."},
{"title":"ELI5: How does coloring black and white pictures work and how do you know which colors to use?","answer":"If you mean \"how do you change an image to greyscale\"...\n\nColor has three \"dimensions\". Hue, saturation, brightness.\n\nHue is the \"color family\". and it goes in a circle: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, and back to red. (These value are continuous, so there are blue-greens, blue-blue-greens, and anything in between).\n\nSaturation is the colorfulness (as opposed to the greyness) of the color. Low-saturation means the color looks dull or grey. High-saturation means vivid. Every time you look at a color wheel like [this one](http://www.tigercolor.com/color-lab/color-theory/images/color-wheel-300.gif), the colors are displayed at the highest levels of saturation\n\nBrightness is how light the color is. This is different than saturation, though. Low-brightness colors look black. High-brightness colors look white.\n\nTo make an image to greyscale on a computer, you just set all the saturation to as low as possible. (At this point, the hue actually doesn't even matter, either). In other words, greyscale images are *only* concerned with the brightness of the image.\n\nIn art, brightness is usually known by another name: value. With a pencil, for example, how hard you press against the paper (and how hard or soft the pencil itself is) determines the value. (Other techniques, such as cross-hatching can affect value as well).\n\nIdeally, a black and white image can be made by only using mixtures of black and white. (All pure mixtures of black and white turn out some shade of grey). "},
{"title":"ELI5: How does the Anti-Mosquito (and insects) sprays work?","answer":"Lots of insecticides are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or otherwise interfere with acetylcholine neurotransmission, causing paralysis and death.

Why does it matter? If they feel the urge to push, isn't it more natural to do so? Shouldn't they?\n\nThanks.","answer":"In general the advice is not to push until the baby is ready to be born.  Pushing too early can apparently cause problems (maybe forcing the baby out before you are fully dilated).\n\nOtherwise, doing what comes naturally is a good idea during childbirth.  That includes getting into the most comfortable position possible, rather than the stereotypical \"on your back, partially inclined\" position you see in the movies.\n"},
{"title":"ELI5:Breaths of air in the Atmosphere!","question_detail":"So I was reading Space Chronicles by Neil deGrasse Tyson and he says in the end of the book, \"There are more air molecules in one breath of air than breath's of air in Earth's atmosphere.\" So saying that we would be breathing air that was also inhaled by people like Napoleon.  I consider myself scientifically ahead of most people my age (16) but this just boggles me... How is this possible?","answer":"Air is comprised of atoms formed into molecules.  The only place that atoms can be destroyed or altered are in stars or during nuclear reactions.  In short, the oxygen molecules and atoms that we are breathing today have existed on Earth since they were formed in stars, although not necessarily in the same molecular form.  (The oxygen you just breathed in is in the form of O2, but probably existed as part of a different compound 100 million years ago.)\n\nThe extrapolation of this is that any atom heavier than hydrogen that exists on Earth today was formed in a star, or star supernova, millions or billions of years ago."},

Maybe there's SOME way where our government can come up with a means of cooperation or compromise. I just hate how our country has been so deeply divided since the beginning. Can someone please help me understand?","answer":"Well there's really 3 questions in this: Why are there parties? Why must there be more than one? &amp; why two dominant parties &amp; not more?\n\nFirst off parties come about because they're simply a good idea for those in office. By being a member of a party you've got a whole bunch of other people who you can coordinate with &amp; with whom you can share your workload. Say you're a member of Congress, there's only so much you can do in a day, so maybe you're one of the go to guys with regard to agricultural policy &amp; you have a party-colleague whose area of expertise is defence. You know you can take his advice &amp; let him do the leg-work in his policy area &amp; you're free to focus on yours. Similarly you might be great at representing your constituents, but you're no good at running an election campaign. No problem, your party can provide you with someone who knows elections inside out to run your campaign for you, however that might be all he's good at &amp; he might not be able to do the kind of work you do. So, basically a well-run party means that each member can focus on doing the job they're good at, which is all in all, better for each member.\n\nAs for question 2: chances are there are a lot of people in your district who don't agree with you (because hey, we aren't always going to agree on everything) &amp; some of them, no-doubt, think they could do a better job than you're doing (not me though, I think you're the best Representative this district's ever had cait4815!). Naturally enough, they're going to want to run against you to try &amp; take your seat. But wait, you're a member of a party &amp; your party has provided you with that guy I mentioned earlier to run your campaign, plus a whole network of experienced campaign-workers. Damn it, that guy's good. These guys who want to unseat you won't have those kind of skills or that kind of an organisation if they try to go it alone, so they need a party too, just to keep up with you.\n\nNow to the trickiest part, why two? The main reason behind that is Duverger's Law. Almost all elections in the US are for a single job (say president, senator, state legislator, whatever) &amp; it's usually simple plurality rule: if Tom gets 5 votes, Dick gets 4 &amp; Harry gets 2, Tom wins, even though only 5 people voted for him &amp; 6 voted against. So if Harry likes Dick better than Tom he should drop out &amp; endorse Dick, that way it goes 5 votes to Tom, 6 to Dick - Dick wins. Voters who prefer minor parties (say the Greens, Libertarian, Constitution etc.) Are like Harry in this example, they know their favourite is extremely unlikely to win, so instead they vote for whichever of the two major parties they like more/dislike less.\n\nIt's not a great system &amp; it's not always pretty, but it actually does work &amp; has done for over 200 years (the Civil War being the one catastrophic failure). Now is an unusually ugly moment in American politics, but as with everything else, this too shall pass. The kind of grandstanding, bluster &amp; procedural sillybuggers that's causing gridlock can't be maintained forever, because there's work to be done &amp; the patience of the voters is far from infinite, phases such as this must ultimately fizzle out when the voters start asking their representatives to actually solve problems instead of simply defeating the other guy."},

But Pirate Bay have blatantly and repeatedly posted torrents on their front page of high profile media that is illegal to download.","answer":"It is not possible to \"shut down\" a site that exists outside of your own jurisdiction (or at least it shouldn't be - looking at the mega upload case). The pirate bay exists on servers all over the globe and no single authority is going to be able to \"shut down\" the website. Even if they managed to, new servers would come online with all the old content on them. The internet is like a sprawling web of computers, every single computer that makes up the pirate bay would need to be disabled in order to completely shut down the site. \n\nWhat can be done (and is being done in the UK at the moment) is that the IP address can be blocked so that internet users cannot access the website without the use of a proxy server."},
{"title":"ELI5: ESPN Blackouts.","answer":"I may miss something here, but this is my general understanding. \n\nBlackouts on ESPN occur based on what sport is being aired. \n\nThe NFL wants people to come to their games and they feel that if people can just watch it at home, they won't show up and pay for tickets. So they force ESPN to not show the game within a certain radius of where the game is being played, so that way people who reasonably could come to the games have to come to the games. \n\nFor MLB and I believe the NHL, the blackout depends on local stations and carriers getting priority over ESPN. So if a local network wants to broadcast a game, they would get automatic priority over ESPN and ESPN would be blacked out in that area so that people would watch the game on the local channel. "},

","answer":"It's a combination of factors.\n\nWhen you're tired, you're not up and about causing noise in your immediate vicinity or distorting the sounds of the TV by moving around.

","answer":"1. That's a matter of opinion, but *my* opinion is no. The purpose of voting is to establish a sense of the populace. For example, the person who should be elected mayor of your town is the candidate who has the support of more people than any other candidate. This only works if the people who vote in the mayoral election all actually have meaningful opinions about who should be mayor. If you have no idea who any of the candidates are and vote for the guy with the coolest-sounding name, you're reducing the extent to which the outcome of the balloting will fairly and correctly represent the sense of the populace.\n\n2. Moot.\n\n3. Nothing has happened in the past three-and-a-half years that could *accurately* be described that way, no. Government is hellaciously complex even at the best of times, and government at the national level in a country the size of the United States is even more complex than that. If a representative in Congress chooses to vote \"no\" on such-and-such a bill for reasons of judgment or conscience, somebody's gonna come along and say \"You just voted 'no' to be obstructionist,\" as if legislators were there only to rubber-stamp the political will of the president. That's true regardless of who's in the White House, but it's never ever correct. Edmund Burke said it best: A representative owes not just his industry but his judgment. Meaning it's not automatically obstructionism to vote \"no\" on a bill the president champions. That's part of what being a representative is all about.\n\n4. Moot again.\n\n5. The use of the word \"promise\" there is incredibly misleading. Let's make up a simplistic example: Say I'm a candidate for president, and I think gasoline should retail for $2 a gallon by 2025. I campaign on this: I want gas to be $2 a gallon by 2025, and if elected I'ma gonna try to make that happen. I win the election, and start working with smart people to come up with a set of governmental decisions and programs that will, in the opinions of some experts, lower the price of gas to $2 a gallon. Then I try to persuade members of Congress to sponsor the legislative parts of my plan, and try to persuade other members to vote in favor of it. Then when it passes, I sign it. As long as my plan works, and somebody doesn't come along after I'm done and revert part or all of it, then the price of gas will be $2 a gallon by 2025. Yay me. (Or boo me, if you happen to be in the \"Gas should be more expensive\" camp.)\n\n6. You don't have to. It's entirely okay, and at this level *extremely* wise and responsible, to say \"I don't have an opinion about that\" and move on to the next thing. Use your own judgment, but above all be forthright about your own limits.\n\n7. The same thing you look for in a president. The vice presidency of the United States is one of the most notoriously powerless elected offices on the planet … but if *anything* happens to the president, the vice president has to step in. Think of him as your backup president. If all goes well, he's just gonna sit there on the shelf for the next four years … but if you ever need him, you're gonna need him *bad.*"},

It's famous for its marketing plan, though.\n\nThey use what's called multi-level marketing. That means that Amway starts by finding a few people who want to try to sell Amway's products. They're not exactly employees; they buy a kit of samples from Amway directly, and then they work on commission, which means they get a little bit of money for every piece they sell.

{"title":"ELI5 The significance of affirming that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel","question_detail":"Over the past few days I've been hearing this idea in American politics quite a bit. Most noticeably Fox News and the Republican party called out the Democratic party for not adopting a plank stating that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, and the Democrats seemed to panic, and adopted a new plank stating just that on the floor of their convention this week.  Since then I've seen a few news reports relating to the issue, and just now on CNN the US ambassador to Israel made mention of the idea that we firmly support the idea that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel.\n\nTo my ears it seems clear that this is some sort of fetishistic idea with much greater implications than I'm able to grasp. Can someone explain to me the significance of the idea, why it is (apparently) an idea in contest, and what the implications of stating say that Tel Aviv is the capital (as I understand the UN and many other nations of the world claim).  Is this primarily a religious issue, or is it more solidly political? It seems like a very strange thing, in my five year old brain, to be a source of controversy and insecurity.","answer":"One of the big reasons people were panicking over Jerusalem was because Senator Obama was very clear back in 2008 that Jerusalem was the capital of Israel, so four years later, when his staff refused to answer the question \"What is the capital of Israel?\" it looked like he was flip-flopping. Personally, as a Jewish guy who thinks Israel should exist, I do NOT think that it's the USA's business where Israel has their capital. Of course, I also don't think it's the business of Egypt, Syria, Iran, Turkey, or any other group of people besides those who live in Israel. "},

This is a BIG difference between UFC and Pride. The Japanese don't like the cutting caused by elbows. \n\n* Judging is also significantly different. Pride judges their fights on the ENTIRE fight, not by the round. \n\nUFC--\n \n* Takes place in the Octagon cage \n\n* Three 5 minute rounds with 1 minute rest between, except for championship matches, which are 5 rounds. \n\n* No strikes to the head when the opponent has 3 or more points on the ground, i.e. is a \"grounded opponent.\" This means no soccer kicks, no knees to the head, etc. \n\n* No stomping a grounded opponent. \n\n* Fights are judged by the round, like boxing. Judges turn in scores following the \"10 Point Must\" system and points are tallied at the end of the fight. \n\nIn addition the weight classes also differ between UFC and Pride, which gets confusing, because they use similar terminology (Middleweight, Welterweight, etc), but refer to different weight ranges. \n\nHope that helps a little! \n\nThere's a lot of other little things too, like in UFC you can't wear a gi, but in Pride you can, etc. For more info check out these links - these are work and family safe, and are links to the official rules pages for both Pride and the UFC. \n\nhttp://www.pridefc.com/pride2005/whats_rules.htm \n\nhttp://www.ufc.com/index.cfm?fa=LearnUFC.Rules \n"},

{"title":"ELI5: Binary conversions.","question_detail":"I just started my first programming class and we went over converting binary to octal, hex, and decimal the other day.  I know it's just a simple conversion, and it should be easy to understand, but *I just don't get it*.  ","answer":"If you understand decimal, you'll understand other bases. Take a number like 6341. What does this mean? Why do we put the digits in that sequence?\n\nIt's because each digit's place represents a particular amount. The \"3\" for example represents the number of hundreds. The \"4\" represents the number of tens. So you can just take all the different powers of ten and see how many of each there are that comprise the final value you're trying to describe:\n\n    6341 = 6*10^3 + 3*10^2 + 4*10^1 + 1*10^0\n\nThe reason we use 10 as our base is coincidence. There's no reason to prefer it over other bases other than we happen to have 10 fingers.\n\nFor computers, binary and higher powers of two are much better. The reason is, at its core, the way a computer represents things is there's a wire somewhere, and there's either current flowing through it or not. It's on or it's off. So if you want to represent a 0, that wire has no current. If you want to represent a 1, you put a little current through. It's not so easy to represent a 2 with that same wire. You could use different levels of current to represent the different numbers, but it's really hard to make sure they're all exactly the right amount, and when you get power fluctuations your numbers would start jumping around. (Not that this hasn't been tried before...there have been ternary computers made in the past.)\n\nSo, how do you represent a two? Well, how about 2 wires? Just like we use different digit places for all the groups of tens, hundreds, etc, you can do the same in binary. Each place, or \"bit\", represents 1's, 2's, 4's, 8's, 16's, etc. And you can make a wire that corresponds to each one. If you have a register comprised of 64 wires, you can represent any 64-bit number by lighting up different wires.\n\nProtip: The reason we use 64 bits is because that also is a power of two, and sometimes you want to refer to something by an address. If you choose a register that has some number of bits that's a power of two, then it's really easy and convenient to describe the location of things (using pointers and addressing)."},

They are telling the world that they are only doing it so that they can have nuclear power, and don't want to make bombs with it. The UN said \"nuh-uh!\", and told Iran to stop or they wouldnt be invited to the UNs birthday party. (Also, sanctions from the UN, I think there is an oil embargo or something.) \n\nAnyway, tensions are mounting because Iran really wants the enriched uranium, but the United Nations doesnt want them to have it.\n\nKinda like if you wanted to make a cake, and your parents said no because they know you're going to screw up the kitchen and the cake might not be that great, but you go ahead and keep trying to make the cake."},

{"title":"ELI5: Counting cards","question_detail":"How does that shit work? And how do you detect if someone is doing it?","answer":"The main reason card counting works is that the dealer is forced to hit 12-16, while the player can decide whether to hit or stand (or double or split).  So when the deck is full of tens and face cards, the dealer will bust more often when he hits hands like 14, 15, and 16.  When the deck is full of low cards 3-6, the dealer hitting 14-16 is more likely to give him a good hand.\n\nIn certain situations, the remaining deck is so full of high cards that the game becomes in the player's advantage.  If you can identify those situations, and can get away with betting a lot more when the game is in your favor and betting less when it isn't, you can theoretically have an advantage over the house.\n\nNobody counts all of the cards - that would be impossible.  Instead, people usually use a \"plus/minus count\" where you only have to count one number.  The basic idea is that you count +1 when you see a low card come out (because that is one less low card left in the remaining deck), and -1 when you see a high card come out (one less high card left).  Then you divide the total by the number of decks remaining - a count of +12 with four decks remaining is an average count of +3 per deck.  When the count is high, you bet more.  When it is around zero or negative, you bet less.  The more you can bet when it is favorable and the less you can bet when it is unfavorable, the higher your advantage will be.\n\nThat's the basic idea, but there are some additional factors that come into play.  Aces are also beneficial to the player, since you get 3-2 on blackjack and you only lose even money on a casino blackjack, so many counts also include aces along with face cards and tens.  And if you know that the deck is full of high cards, you might change some of your plays - like not hitting 16 against a dealer's 10, for example.  Many casinos will kick you out or even bar you if they catch you card counting for serious money, so you have to hide your play, like by making some deliberately wrong plays at times when it doesn't cost you very much, or not changing your bet suddenly and by a large amount.\n\nCasinos detect card counters by looking for someone who is betting very little for a long time and out of nowhere puts out a huge bet, for someone who is watching a game for a while and then sits down and bets big (many casinos don't allow you to enter in the middle of a shoe for that reason), or for someone who appears to be a strong player and then makes a ridiculous play like splitting fives (that no good player would ever do unless he was counting cards)."},

{"title":"ELI5: Creation of the universe?","question_detail":"Just wanted to ask how the universe was created and what the big bang is (in the science version, of course, not the creationism one).\nThanks Reddit!","answer":"Based upon extrapolations of how the universe is behaving now and telescopes picking up information coming from so far away that it is literally billions of years old, scientists have come to the conclusion that all matter and energy in the universe was once contained at a single point, commonly called a singularity.  The nature of this singularity is basically unknown as there is no way to gather information from any point earlier than after the universe started expanding away from this point.\n\nIn this moment in time, all matter in the universe existed only as subatomic particles, the particles that make up the the particles that make up an atom (that isn't a typo).  An atom is made up of Protons, Neutrons, and Electrons, and these are made up various other particles known as Quarks, Leptons, and Bosons (which includes the recently verified Higgs Boson).  In the first few moments after the Big Band, these particles cooled enough to group into the Protons, Neutrons, and Electrons.  These particles formed the bonds that created the first hydrogen atoms.\n\nEventually, minor variations in density in this primordial cloud of hydrogen cause the atoms to clump together due to gravity.  This start the domino effect of more and more hydrogen being drawn together until the pressure and temperature became so high that nuclear fusion started to occur, causing the hydrogen to fuse into helium in the universe's first stars.  These stars were super massive and only had very short lifespans compared to most stars found in the universe today.  When the stars died, they went super nova, which briefly (by star lifespan standards) created conditions so hot that the atoms were able to fuse into even heavier elements, such as carbon, oxygen, and iron.\n\nAt the same time, the stars were grouping themselves into clusters and galaxies, and galactic clusters due to gravity, creating many of the larger systems we see today.  Eventually, enough heavier matter was formed and ejected in stars and supernovas for there to be enough mass for planetary systems, like our solar system, to form.\n\nSo quite literally, nearly every atom in your body, on this Earth, and in existence today that isn't hydrogen was once forged inside a star or star supernova.  (Except for the minor handful of atoms created as a result of nuclear weapon detonations)."},

I understand the answer could be either very simple or very complicated, so just ELI5! ","answer":"Batteries themselves are \"dumb\" things, they would not know when to stop charging. \n\nIt's the job of the charger to constantly check how well the battery is charged and stop sending electricity to the battery once it's full. \n\nBasically, let's take as an example a simple AA battery, which has written on it 1.2v. It has a very low voltage when it's empty, let's say 0.8v. As they charge, the voltage goes very fast to 1.3-1.5v. Once the voltage goes up to this level, the battery will continue to accept electricity but at a much reduced rate and once it's at 1.5 or somewhere around the value it goes up a bit in a very short time and then it almost stops completely... it's as if the battery is \"fed up\". Simply put, the chemical material inside the battery is saturated with electrons.\n\nHere's a typical graph of how battery takes electricity from a charger: \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/1jwoi.png\n\nAs you can see, a smart charger can detect that the voltage no longer increases, it remains at a high level for a long time, and it will either stop or reduce the amount of electricity it sends into the battery, to a very low level, that doesn't hurt the battery. \n\nLithium batteries, the ones in laptops and cell phones, are a bit of a special case... they're more sensitive to heat and to over-charging, so they usually have attached to them a small circuit which disconnects the battery from the charger when it detects something is bad.\n\nYou can read more about how lithium  batteries are charged here: http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_lithium_ion_batteries\n"},

","answer":"The cassette tape is made up of a plastic tape with metallic powder glued to it. When you or the factory records something on the tape, the tape is moved at a certain speed over something that magnetizes the metallic powder glued to the tape.\n\nWhen the deck wants to \"read\" the tape it starts to move the tape in front of a reading head which detects those small magnetic variations and amplifies that back to the music.\n\nThat cassette adapter in the picture takes the analogue audio (it's not digital, what gets sent to the speakers or headphones on that classic stereo jack is analogue) and  it sends this sound to a magnet put just where the tape used to be read by the decks. \n\nThis magnet is almost identical to the magnet that is used in the past to record the tapes, so the moment this magnet makes a pulse, it's directly picked up by the deck's read head, amplified and so on.... as if it would read a regullar cassette tape.\n\nThe cassette still has a bit of clear tape around the rolls, which has no purpose other than tricking the deck into thinking there's a real cassette there. Some advanced decks can \"feel\" the tension in the tape when they roll the cassette and without tape, those cassette players would not work.\n"},

With string, they could draw straight lines (hang the string between two points, and it'll hang over a straight line between those two points) and circles (fix one end and keep the line taut as you sweep out a curve, and you'll cover all the points that are the same distance from the center; that's a circle), and measure distances. By combining those tools, they found ways of doing things like finding the line that divides a triangle exactly in half and passes though one of its angles, or drawing perfect pentagons.\n\nEven when they started drawing on paper, they made tools that did the same thing; straightedges and compasses.\n\nSome mathematicians who like origami noticed that, by using folds in paper (instead of ink and straightedges), they could do the same sorts of thing. If you had two lines that form an angle, and wanted to find a third line that divided that angle exactly in two, you can do that in just one fold (with a compass and straightedge, it takes several steps).\n\nThis paper is about setting up a formal way of describing the steps that you can use in folding, and looking at the kinds of problems that you can solve, using those steps."},

When gravity is very very strong, it will also change very very very fast...think about hovering just a few inches over a black hole, your feet are almost touching it... by your head is very far away, that means the gravity is pulling really hard on your leg compared to your head... like jerking someones arm who is just standing there...OUCH... you could pull an arm off doing that... in the same way, the black hole will pull your legs off...\n\nAnother way to think about it, is imagine some regular graph paper... very nice regular squares, right? Now imagine the square in the center of your paper is expanding, getting bigger and bigger...what happens to the other squares? Well the ones right next to it get scrunched together, and the closer you are to the edge of the growing square, the more scrunched the other squares are... that is curvature, the normally flat lines are being scrunched.... until (like in a black hole) right next to the edge, the other squares around it have vanished, there is like ring of squares that have vanished, and the further you get away, the less and less the squares are squished, until you are far enough away, that the squares are the normal \"flat\" squares you had before you started growing the center one...\n\nOK, now image you draw a little stick man on the surface of the giant square.. the squares that are round his feet are really squished and up by his head the squares are not so squished...

Chemical reactions give the products new structures, densities, shapes, electrical properties, and so on.

On climate time scales, which are much longer than two weeks, atmospheric water is very nearly in equilibrium with the surface, which means that as much water enters the atmosphere by evaporating from the surface as is lost to the surface by rain and snow. One cannot simply tally up the sources and sinks and figure our which wins; a more involved argument is needed.\"\n\nIt's a big question, I think, but if anyone is willing to help me understand that would be awesome. Thanks.\n","answer":"I'm a physics student but admittedly not a climate specialist, so I have made some assumptions here, however I think I can convey the gist of it for you.. if any climate experts are around feel free to correct me.\n\nWell in modelling real physical systems, it's near impossible to account every contributing factor in the situation, as there are so many. As such one must make some sort of assumption/generalisation in order to simplify the system to a level where predictions can be made. The problem is further exacerbated by the fact that many of these factors influence the behaviour of another, so making a small assumption or discounting a seemingly minor variable can lead to massive inaccuracies in your predicted result.\n\nThe behaviour of water vapour is an integral part of any weather/climate prediction, as it is a major factor in change in essentially all relevant quantities (air temperature, pressure, convection currents, etc.). However the behaviour of water vapour and the nature of the mechanisms behind it (we're talking about the behaviour of an unimaginably large number of water molecules here) means that predictions related to it cannot be calculated on a definite basis, rather based on a statistical approach to find the **most likely** outcomes. Due to the huge number of variables and the way they interact, this approach is also necessary for just about every other facet of climate modelling.\n\nAs such there is no definitive approach to modelling vapour, and different studies will take different approaches with their models, each with varying degrees of error, and these errors will be carried on into any modelling of the big picture. \n\nTL;DR (I got a bit carried away..): There are too many variables with extremely complex internal relationships for definitive modelling, and the nature of water vapour behaviour is especially complex. More complexity requires more assumptions --&gt; more errors --&gt; less useful data "},

Appananas? You can’t add up apples and bananas. You have 8 *fruit*. You have 4 apples and 4 bananas. So the correct answer is 4+4. You have \"4+4 Apple-Bananas\". The first 4 is a different number to the second 4. You just learnt a new number! \n\n*But the 4's are the same!*\n\nThe first 4 is an apple count, the second 4 is a banana count.

{"title":"ELI5: How many \"5 point plans\" does Mitt Romney have and what are they? Why would they work/ not work?","question_detail":"I've heard him say it over and over in the debates, and I honestly don't understand why there are so many, nor do I understand what they are.  \n\nThanks!","answer":"Right, here we go.  Full disclosure: I'm a liberal, so I may be biased, despite trying not to be.\n\nAs far as I know, Romney has only one \"five-point plan\" that he talks about regularly.  He does say it a whole lot, though, so I could see how you'd get confused and think he has several.  Romney's \"five-point plan\" is what he proposes to fix the economy.  In it, he proposes:\n\n- Cut income tax rates for all taxpayers by 20%\n- Keep the tax rates the same for interest, dividends, and capital gains.  These are all investments, ways to grow money over time, and they are mainly used by businesses and the wealthy.\n- Eliminate taxes on interest, dividends, and capital gains for those making less than $200,000 per year.  The goal is to encourage people to invest.\n- Eliminate the estate tax, or \"death tax,\" as he calls it.  This is a tax on inheritances valued over $5,000,000.  As you'd expect, it effects a very small portion of high-earning taxpayers.\n- Repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT).  This is actually not a bad idea.  Basically, the AMT is a higher income tax rate with fewer exemptions that was originally designed to keep the super-rich from avoiding the income tax by using various loopholes.  But, the AMT hasn't kept up with inflation, meaning that more and more people in the middle class have to pay it every year.  Currently, if you make over $48,450 as a single person or $74,450 as a married couple, you have to pay the higher AMT rates.  Not exactly taxing the Rockefellers.\n- He also wants to lower the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 25% and repeal the Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\") and the small taxes included in it.  These two aren't part of the five-point plan on his tax page, though.\n\nSo, that's the plan.  Now, on to why it won't work.  All of my figures are from a recent study by the Tax Policy Center, a very well-respected research group that the Romney campaign has cited as recently as two days ago.  \n\nAccording to the study, which draws on Congressional Budget Office estimates, all of these cuts would result in a loss of $456 billion in government revenue, or $4.56 trillion over the standard 10-year budget period; the $480 billion figure being thrown about is from an earlier TPC study that did not include adjustments for certain market behaviors. Romney plans to offset that revenue loss by eliminating loopholes and deductions in the tax code.\n\nThe TPC cut every tax deduction they could, starting from the top of the income scale and moving down. They calculated that roughly 65% of all available tax expenditures - things that people use to pay less tax - would have to be cut, including, but not limited to, the mortgage interest deduction, employer-provided health insurance deduction, state and local tax exclusions, deductions for charitable contributions, and benefits for low- to middle-class families such as the child tax credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Apart from the fact that these deductions are extremely popular, and therefore very difficult to repeal, they mainly benefit the low and middle class. That means that high-income earners would receive a bigger tax break than lower-income earners, the exact opposite of what you want in our progressive tax system.\n\nWhen the TPC crunched the numbers, they found that those making less than $200,000 per year - roughly 95% of taxpayers - would end up with after-tax incomes about 1.2% lower than under current policy. Those making $200,000 and up, however - the top 5 percent of taxpayers - would see their after-tax incomes go up by at least 0.8%, going higher with income. Those making over $1,000,000 would see an after-tax income increase of 4.3%. In effect, Romney's tax plan would shift roughly $86 billion of the tax burden from those making over $200,000 to those making less than $200,000. Note that all of these numbers assume that all of those very politically popular exclusions and deductions are removed completely; if they are not, the program would shift even more of the burden to the middle class.\n\nSo, according to math, there is no way for Romney to pay for his tax plan without shifting a significant part of the tax burden from the wealthiest of Americans to those earning less. There simply aren't enough exemptions to eliminate. Beyond that, Romney plans to add $2 trillion to military spending, and to make the Bush-era tax cuts permanent, another $1 trillion.  Unless the Governor is some kind of wizard who can alter the very laws of mathematics and finance, his plan simply will not work.\n\n**TL; DR: Romney's five-point plan wants to cut a lot of taxes, but the math says he can't pay for it.**"},
{"title":"ELIA5 How the moon reflects sunlight without the Earth always getting in the way","question_detail":"If the Earth is in between the sun and the moon, how does the moon still reflect sunlight? Are the lunar phases caused by the shadow of the earth, and if so why do they operate on a monthly cycle rather than a nightly one? (Why can't we see the shadow of the earth pass over the moon as the night goes on and the moon get's closer to the horizon?) ","answer":"[Here's a picture of the moon orbit around the earth.](http://astrobob.areavoices.com/astrobob/images/Full_moon_and_lighting_orbit_1.jpg)  As you can see, half of the moon is always lit by the sun.  But we can't always see all of that half from earth.  \n\nWhen the moon is between us and the sun, we can't see the lit half at all because it's on the other side.  That's called a new moon.  When we are between the sun and the moon, we can see all of the lit half.  That's a full moon.  Between these two we can only see part of the lit half and we see a crescent moon.  It takes about a month for the moon to do a full turn around us, so that's why the lunar phases operate on a roughly monthly cycle.\n\nNow the orbit of the moon is not exactly aligned with our orbit around the sun.  So when we're between the moon and the sun, we don't always cast a shadow on the moon: sometimes the moon passes over or under our shadow.  When it goes through our shadow, that's a lunar eclipse.

{"title":"What is the difference between Dopamine, Endorphins & Serotonin...and how are they used by your body/brain?","answer":"These are all different chemicals your brain puts out to get the body to feel a certain way. \r\rSerotonin is a chemical that makes you relaxed, and makes the body tired and sleepy. I'm pretty sure this is so that the body knows when to shut down for sleep so it doesn't burn out. People who have sleeping problems sometimes have problems with the way their brains either make or take in serotonin.\r\rEndorphins are put out to give a pleasing rush of feelings under physical or mental stress. I believe this is sort of of like adrenaline in that it helps to override pain. This gives a feeling of wellness in the body to promote this action again. This is why people enjoy working out or doing sports. Some people who have problems with this chemical can get pain and pleasure mixed up, and will hurt themselves because it feels good.\r\rDopamine gives you that pure rush that, when you get old enough, one day you will feel during sex. It also comes from lots of other things, like a good movie or video game, or anything you enjoy doing and makes you want to do it more. Drugs also flood our brains with this chemical, and makes us feel really good. But in order to balance it out, our brains make more of the \"ports\" that receive dopamine. And when we aren't taking any drugs, there aren't near enough chemicals released to fill the ports up, which makes us feel terrible. That's part of why withdrawal feels so bad for drug addicts."},

{"title":"Why do some people believe in genuine free will?","question_detail":"I'm not talking about making a choice from right or wrong and acting on those decisions. I'm not even talking about something simple as driving to work or biking. I'm talking about GENUINE free will in it's simplest form. From the beginning of time, every single action has had a reaction. If one atom was in a different location or acted with another particle a fraction of a second later or earlier than it did, there would be a different universe that what there is today.\n\n It's like a snowball effect, one meteor hits another, which hits another, and so on. It's easy to understand this method for example because you can see it happen in any experiment. Place a bunch of marbles in a circle and fling one and see the chain of reactions. Imagine each person as a separate marble now and apply that to the universe. How are we any different from the meteors that hit each other? We are both creations of the same place and time, just only many years after. \n\nThe difference is consciousness and the ability to reflect upon ourselves. Just because we are capable of identifying ourselves does not mean we no longer abide by nature. I like to view it as this; if I was to hit my left hand on my desk, then every single action for the last 13.7 billion years was leading up to it and the cause of it. People who think there's such a thing as free will might say \"huh, ok. I'll prove nature wrong and hit my right hand on the desk instead\". But every single action from the beginning of time has made you come to that conclusion and hit your right hand instead.\n\nAll I'm saying is that in the end, we are just a part of what was, is, and always will be. We are just \"lucky\" (if you believe that there was any other way this would happen) to have the capability of reflecting upon ourselves both individually and universally. This isn't an excuse to always say \"it was meant to be\" when there's something to learn from those situations but it is something interesting to think about. I think that people who refuse such theories are those that don't want to give up their sense of control. Do you believe in this or not? And if not, why?","answer":"So you seem to have free will defined as \"Some action that cannot be predicted\". Since you can predict me hitting my right hand, me hitting my right hand isn't an expression of free will.\n\nWhat would happen if we examined the universe and we found that we actually weren't able to predict what hand people were hitting? Going further than that, what if we developed a very sophisticated set of laws that predict the world around us, however those laws tell us that some things in the universe simply could not be predicted (hitting right vs left hands being one of them)? Would this mean free will actually *does* exist?\n\nNow for a different line of reasoning: Lets say we create a computer that can predict with 100% accuracy what hand I will hit. Now lets put that computer in the same room as me and have it display its prediction. It suddenly will not be able to predict what hand I hit (I just won't hit the hand it displays). What does this mean about free will? Maybe you'll say \"Sure that computer suddenly loses it's ability to predict, but some other computer sitting outside of the room would be able to predict everything.\" We can treat the first computer and me (the one hitting the hands) as a single system that can be predicted. However, any time we make that predicting agent a part of the system it's trying to predict, that ability to predict absolutely disappears. This means humans will never be able to fully predict the universe around us because we are a part of the system we're trying to predict. \n\nHow does this change your understanding of free will?"},

","question_detail":"I find it interesting that a country with such a history can get in such a bad economic situation and im wondering what went wrong and how are they going to fix the issue.","answer":"Germany and France created the \"Financially Responsible Country\" club.  You would have to meet minimum membership standards, but once you were in, you'd get better deals from other members, and you could all work together to get better deals from the rest of the world.\n\nWhen Greece was accepted, they rest of the world said \"hey, Greece must be doing pretty good\", and was more willing to lend them money.  Greece started borrowing a lot of money, and used it to build infrastructure, expand the public sector, and generally improve their economy.\n\nThe problem was, Greece lied about meeting membership standards, and wasn't doing that good to being with.  They went on a spending bender for the better part of a decade without really bothering to look at their credit card statements.  Now their debt is so bad, they have no way of paying it back, or even covering their current expenses, without massive and painful cuts.\n\n**TL;DR** Greece lied about how well it was doing, borrowed an assload of money, and now can't pay it back.

Where you would wake up crying for mommy and daddy and they would come and say \"everything is all right\", check for the monster under the bed, then give you your teddy bear and you'd fall right back to sleep?\nThis funny thing called \"insomnia\" is just like that - except without the nightmares. A person with insomnia has not had a nightmare, but this person cannot fall asleep, no matter how many times mommy or daddy tell them there's no monster under the bed, or even if they know there's no monster under the bed. Really really smart people all over the world are trying to figure out what causes this, but no one has figured it out yet.\n\nSometimes people get \"insomnia\" for a few days. Remember sometimes how mom and dad puts you to sleep, but you don't actually fall asleep and instead sneak off to listen at their bedroom door and see that the light is on? Well, sometimes mommy and daddy have lots of things on their minds and because of this, they can't fall asleep. If this happens for several days, that's what we call \"transient insomnia\".\n\nOther times people get sick. Really, really sick. Because they're really, really sick, they can't sleep, and they can't sleep for a long time, like a month or more. This is what we call \"chronic insomnia\". \n\nStill other times, people do things they shouldn't do before bed, like drink lots and lots of soda or watch lots and lots of TV or run around with their friends before going to bed. This also prevents them from sleeping. If people do this a lot, then they have \"insomnia\". \n\nSo how do we not get \"insomnia\" if we're not really, really sick? We don't invite our friends to come over and play right before we go to bed and we try to not watch TV or use the computer an hour before bed. Instead, we read our story books instead, maybe cuddle with mom and dad, and maybe have a glass of warm milk before we sleep. Or we hug/talk to our teddy bear.\n\nSleep well, child."},

However, when the air is humid and filled with little droplets of water, they collect all the specs like little globs of glue.

When 'the wind is knocked out of you', say with a fall, that reserved capacity is pushed out of your lungs. The tiny balloons collapse making it hard for your lungs to get oxygen into your blood and CO2 out of your blood. That is why you gasp for air, you have to fill up the balloons. \nAs a side note, it is not a lack of oxygen that makes you want to breathe when you hold your breath, it is because there is a build up of CO2 in your cerebral spinal fluid.

{"title":"Explain to me like I'm five Chiral Molecules (text included)","question_detail":"From the Gale encyclopedia of Science (Long & Lots of big words)\n\nA molecule is said to be chiral if it lacks symmetry and its mirror images are not superimposable. To be chiral a molecule must lack symmetry, that is, a chiral molecule can not have any type of symmetry.\n\nCarbon atoms with four sp3 hybridized orbitals can enter into up to four different bonds about the central carbon atom. When the central carbon bonds with differing atoms or groups of atoms the carbon is termed an asymmetric carbon atom. Bromochlorofluoromethane is an example of such a molecule. The central carbon, with four sp3 bonds oriented (pointing) to the corners of a tetrahedron, is bonded to bromine, chlorine, fluorine, and methane atoms. There is no symmetry to this molecule.\n\nChiral carbon atoms are also assigned an R and S designation. Although the rules for determining this designation can be complex, for simple molecules and compounds with chiral carbons the determination is easily accomplished with the help of a model of the molecule. The four different bonded groups are assigned a priority. When assigning priority to groups, atoms that are directly bonded to the central chiral carbon atom have their priority based upon their atomic number. The atom with the highest atomic number has highest priority and the atom with the lowest atomic number the lowest priority. As a result, hydrogen atoms bonded to the chiral molecule have the lowest priority. If isotopes are bonded then the isotope with the largest mass has the higher priority. The molecule is then turned so that the lowest priority group is farthest away from view. If one must take a counterclockwise path from the highest to lowest priority group the chiral configuration is said to be sinister (S). If the path from highest to lowest priority groups is clockwise then the chiral molecule is said to be rectus (R).\n\nThe compound carvone has two three-dimensional structures, one S and the other R (see Figure 4).\n\nThe compounds differ in their three-dimensional structure by the position of the indicated hydrogen atom. In S-Carvone, only the hydrogen atom is pointed into the paper, while in the R compound, the hydrogen atom is coming out of the paper. S-Carvone has a caraway flavor when tasted, whereas the R compound has the flavor of spearmint.\n\nThe rectus (R) and sinister (S) property relates to the structure of an individual molecule. In contrast, dextro (+) and levo (-) properties are based on the properties of a large collection of the molecules or complex.\n\nBecause a molecule can have more than one chiral carbon, the number of stereoisomers can be determined by the 2n rule, where n equals the number of chiral carbons. Thus, if one chiral carbon is present there are two possible stereoisomers, with two chiral carbons there are four possible stereoisomers. Any chemical reaction that yields predominantly one stereoisomer out of several stereoisomer possibilities is said to be a stereoselective reaction.\n\n\nI need this for chemistry!","answer":"Look at your hands. Put them flat on a table and then put one on top of the other. There is no way that you can rotate your hands so that they are the same. The thumbs will never overlap the same unless you flip one hand or the other over. That's a different sort of rotation from what I'm describing.\n\nThis is why some molecules are called right-handed and others left-handed."},

{"title":"ELI5: how does the US voting system works","question_detail":"I am not American and wondering how the system works? I mean what's the purpose of the popular vote if the election depends on the electoral vote? And why is that all electoral vote for each state was either to Obama or Romney?","answer":"There's no actual nationwide popular vote. When people talk about the popular vote, what's going on is that they're looking at the results from the election of each state and adding them all up so they can talk about how the country at large feels about the candidate.\n\nWhat actually determines the election is the electoral college.\n\nThe way the electoral college works is that every state gets votes based on the number of seats they have in Congress. You get one seat for each senator you have and each representative in the house. There's 100 senators (2 for each state) and 435 members of the House of Representatives (where seats are given out based on population but everyone is guaranteed at least one). In addition we give Washington DC three votes because we don't want to leave them out either.\n\nThis brings the total number of electoral votes to 538. Like I said before, each state is guaranteed at least three votes because every state has two senators and at least one person in the house. This means that small states only get three votes but large states may have a lot of votes. California, for example has 55.\n\nLike I said before, the states aren't actually required to let the people vote on who they want to be president, but they all do anyway. The way this works is that on the Tuesday following the first Monday in November (weird way of specifying, I know) the states hold elections. When you go to vote you get a ballot that will have a list of candidates on it. You select your candidate and turn in your ballot. Your state then collects all the ballots, counts up all the votes, and then chooses people to represent the state in the electoral college based on who won the popular vote in that state. The people who represent their state are called electors.\n\nElectors are actually chosen by the party in the state that sends them. So let's say Barack Obama wins your state. What then happens is that your state government will go to the Democratic Party in your state and ask who they want the electors to be. The party will then give them a list of people who the state will then be the state's voters at the electoral college. These electors cannot currently hold any sort of federal office and cannot have previously sworn an oath of office to uphold the Constitution and then rebelled. (the second part is mostly the result of the Civil War)\n\nMost states use what's called a winner-take-all system where whoever wins the popular vote gets all of the electoral votes for the state. The two exceptions to this are Nebraska and Maine, they assign electors in proportion to how many votes each candidate got. The reason most states choose to allocate their electors with a winner-take-all system is because the electoral college slightly more weight to rural states. If rural states were to divide their votes proportionally it would effectively mitigate that extra weight.\n\nIn many states electors are free to vote for whomever they want, however some states have laws that require electors to vote for the person they're supposed to. That being said, getting appointed to be an elector is a pretty prestigious position and voting differently than the way you're supposed to vote is a good way of making sure your party will never back you for anything ever again.\n\nThe electors will then get together in their state's capitol on the Monday after the second Wednesday in December and meet and cast their votes for president and vice president. Those votes are then sent on to Washington where the newly elected Congress will meet in a special session on January 6th to count the votes and declare a winner.\n\nIn the event that no candidate receives a majority, (270 votes) Congress must go into a special session where the House elects the President and the Senate elects the Vice President. In this scenario, in the House each state only gets one vote, Senators are allowed to vote normally. They keep voting until one candidate gets a majority.\n\nIn the event that no presidential candidate gets a majority by the time of the inauguration (noon on January 20th), the Vice President Elect (the guy who's been voted in as VP but hasn't been sworn in yet) is the acting President until the House can agree on someone. If neither a President or Vice-President is agreed on, the Speaker of the House is acting President."},

Communist, dictatorship, plutocracy, monarchy, it doesn't matter much. What matters more is whether or not a country has something to offer, be it trade(China/US), strategic or political power(Israel/US), intelligence, influence, or diplomatic agreements. \n\n[Realpolitik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realpolitik) is the name of the game. \n\n---\n\nAlso, remember that it isn't communism against democracy, so much as communisim versus capitalism. \n\nCommunism and Capitalism are very directly opposed. Communists view capitalism as an appropriation of the means of production by the wealthy few, and capitalists view communism as greedy thieves who don't want to work.\n\nDemocracy flourishes when you have a large middle class, and capitalism just happens to grow the middle class. \n\nCommunist countries aren't opposed to democracies, but most democracies just happen to be capitalist countries. \n\n---\n\nTL;DR Any tension betweens countries is more likely due to other reasons than ideology\n\n**TL;DR** [realpolitik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realpolitik)\n\n\n"},
{"title":"CPU and GPU bottlenecks","question_detail":"i just dont understand what either of them are/how they come about. THANK YOU IN ADVANCE","answer":"Think of your computer as an assembly line, with several different workers. It's producing images. Each worker has a different job to do, and each can't work on an image until the previous worker has finished with it. When the last worker (the GPU) finishes, it puts the image on your screen. If every worker can handle at least 60 images per second, you get 60 frames per second. However, if even one worker can't keep up, everybody else has to wait for them, and the framerate suffers.\n\nMore specifics:\n\nGPU and CPU are responsible for different things in a game. In the simple cases, they do almost completely different work.\n\nAs you might expect, the GPU will usually mostly handle drawing things to the screen. It accepts commands to draw shapes and textures, and it generates the image. It can sometimes do some other stuff, but this is the simple case.\n\nThe CPU does everything else. It has to handle everything that goes on in whatever game you're playing. It handles all the enemy's behavior, it calculates bullet trajectories. It might have to do physics calculations. And then, after all that is done, it has to send the drawing instructions to the GPU.\n\nConsider that computers display things as frames. For one frame to be drawn, two things have to happen first: the CPU has to do all the work and determine what needs to be drawn, and the GPU has to draw it. If the CPU takes too long to do its work, the GPU doesn't get its instructions, and your framerate drops. If the GPU can't keep up with the group, less frames are produced, and again your framerate drops.\n\nIt's not really possible to simply say that your computer has a CPU or a GPU bottleneck, because it depends on the software. Some games will require more GPU power than others, and some will require more CPU power than others. Perhaps in a game that has crazy awesome graphics but is actually very very simple, your GPU would be the bottleneck. Using the same computer, playing a game that does complex simulations but has simplistic graphics, the CPU could be the bottleneck. With yet another game that deals with extremely large amounts of data, your memory could even be the bottleneck (this probably almost never happens)."},

{"title":"ELI5: Ammunition sizes.  Bullets and such...","question_detail":"For example, what is the difference between like a 308 and a 30-06?  Why are they called 30- aught- six?  Why are some in mm and some measured in decimals? Thanks in advance...","answer":"The aught question is well answered, so I'll tackle the mm/caliber one more in-depth.\n\nThe simple answer is that they are two different standards for the same measurements. A barrel's diameter can be roughly measured in millimeters, or in inches. A .50 caliber gun shoots a round that's half an inch across. This does not signify anything about the round other than the length across: a .50 caliber round can be the action-express pistol round or the full .50 caliber rifle round.\n\nThe .50 caliber provides a further example: the standard .50 BMG (machine gun) round can also be found under the title '12.7mm NATO'. They mean the same thing: .5 inches = 12.7mm, roughly.\n\nSome rounds are easier to express in mm than caliber. The .40 caliber S&amp;W is a well known revolver round, but less well known as the '10mm round'. The common 9mm round, on the other hand, would have to go under the name .355 caliber, which is a bit of a mouthful in comparison!\n\nOnce you go above .50 caliber, it's more common to find rounds marked in millimeters: The 25mm cannon round is well known to the US military, used in the Bushmaster cannons of the Bradley AFVs and some aircraft: in calibers, it would be 1.0 caliber, but it's never (or perhaps rarely) mentioned in this way. The 4.7 caliber round is better known as the 120mm tank round, used in US and English battle tanks.\n\nThe reason for higher-diameter rounds using millimeters rather than calibers is a more complex question. From [what I can tell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_pistol_and_rifle_cartridges), the US and England used predominantly calibers in measuring their rounds, whereas mainland Europe (Germany and Russia in particular) favored millimeters. This trend would be seen extensively in the second world war: the US favored .30 and .45 caliber, the Germans 9mm and 7.92mm rounds. England did something regarding the weight of their ammunition, and the Russians got really drunk. It is a question for historians then, if we abandoned caliber designations for cannon rounds for some significant reason: perhaps due to Russian and German tank divisions being the largest and most wide-spread forces in the war? Such as, after their widespread adoption of mm designations, it became the norm? \n\nSo, to wrap up this increasingly-poorly-designed-for-five-year-olds story, mm and caliber are the same measurement, just in either metric or inches, for the width of the barrel of the gun, and some bullets can be found in both caliber and mm names."},
{"title":"ELI5: Supersymmetry","answer":"I feel very conflicted about the given answer, so I'll do my best to explain supersymmetry (SUSY) but I'm sure that someone will be conflicted about my answer so point things out and make it better. Sorry it's long.\n\nMuch of the success of particle physics has come from the application of symmetry principles. Let's think about two symmetries. Imagine being a weightlifter and you can lift some amount of weight in Paris. Should you be able to lift the same amount of weight in Seoul? Of course, Why not? This is an example of a translation. If I move you to Seoul nothing should change. In physics, translation is an example of a spacetime symmetry. It's a symmetry of the background for our experiment/theory. The spacetime symmetries of the Standard Model (SM) build something called the Poincare group, which we'll come back to.\n\nThe other sort of symmetry is a gauge symmetry. Let's imagine that you have a pristine white dinner plate in front of you. And now imagine before you sat down for a delicious meal, I rotated that plate about it's center. Would you notice a difference? This is an example of a rotation or if we want to get fancy a U(1) symmetry. Our theory, in this case the position of the plate, has a free parameter our rotation which is an example of a \"gauge\" symmetry. The SM has three gauge symmetries, which I won't mention any further. \n\nAnyway, in the late 60's Coleman and Madula proved an eponymous theorem that says that there are no nontrivial (i.e. cool) extensions of the Poincare group, basically everything interesting is already there. The one exception, the one cool thing we can add, is SUSY. So we should think about SUSY as a symmetry of spacetime.\n\nNothing so far has answered the question of what it is, and for that I'm sorry. SUSY is a symmetry which relates bosons and fermions. A boson is a particle with integer spin (0,1, ...) and a fermion has half-integer spin (1/2, 3/2, ...). We should think of spin as a label saying what sort of statistics a given particle follows. So for each particle in the SM, like an electron (a fermion), we can essentially rotate our plate (it's more like looking in a mirror), applying SUSY, and end up with another particle which is a boson. We can do the same thing with the Higgs Boson and end up with a fermion. We call these different spinned friends, superpartners, and give them funny names. If our initial particle is a fermion, we tack an \"s\" in front to name its superpartner. Hence, the electron's partner is the selectron. Bosons add \"ino\" to the end, hence higgsino. \n\nSo every particle in the SM has a superpartner, now what? I want to make an assertion, if SUSY is an exact symmetry of nature (respected at all scales) then sparticles, the superpartners, must have the exact same mass as our particles. We should be scratching our heads at this point asking why we haven't already seen sparticles, especially if the selectron has the same mass as the electron and we see electrons all the time. The solution is that SUSY must be a broken symmetry. Imagine that we take our dinner plate and then eat a delicious, albeit messy, meal on it. We've left behind remnants of our meal preventing us from freely rotating our plate. By eating off it we've broken our symmetry, which is the case for SUSY. How SUSY breaks controls how massive our superpartners are. For example, in the minimal implementation of supersymmetry (minimal in the sense of simplest), the minimal supersymmetric standard model, has 105 parameters describing how supersymmetry breaks. This is a veritable nightmare but can be drastically simplified with other assumptions about how we break SUSY, albeit by introducing new physics. \n\nAll of this is I guess is to say SUSY is a unique extension of symmetries of spacetime that relates bosons and fermions. One of the greatest triumphs of SUSY is that it controls the divergence of the Higgs mass, which I'll talk about if there's interest.\n\n\n\n\n"},

{"title":"Why do dress shirts wrinkle and why do they form?","question_detail":"Why is it that dress shirts and any clothing made of the same fabric wrinkle? Why do they form? ","answer":"Just like the human skin, when fabrics and materials like leather get dehydrated they contract, and when the fabric eventually drys, it gets stuck in that position. The molecules have no lubrication of sorts to rub against each other and have more friction against each other. When you add water ( like steam from an iron ) they loosen slide past each other (and get slightly larger ((which is why dry clothes shrink compared to wet clothes ))) more easily. Then the heat from the iron drys the moisture out of the fabric while smoothing it out flat and boom. No wrinkles. "},

But what purpose does it serve blocking off 25% of the roadway? Maybe to facilitate merging?","answer":"The process of merging is the biggest reason that a road that otherwise has enough capacity will become congested. If someone cuts in front of another person when they are trying to merge, that second person will have to tap on their brakes. The person behind them will typically brake a little bit more and the person behind them even more. Eventually you end up with traffic at a stand still.\n\nIf there's a lane specifically for merging then the merging person can get up to speed and find a gap which doesn't require anyone to slow down.

{"title":"How does a Gauss gun/cannon work?","question_detail":"I saw [this gif](http://i.imgur.com/MKoDK.gif) of a Gauss cannon but I have no idea how it works.","answer":"That's not a real gauss gun.  It's a bunch of magnets which are arranged in such a way that there is a bunch of energy stored in their sequence.  When the first magnet contacts the first bunch, it knocks it forward, causing a ripple effect (similar to the newton's cradle), and the magnet on the end goes flying off at a *higher* speed than the first magnet because at the end of the first magnet's roll, it gets sucked in and moves faster because of the first magnet stack's field.  This happens again with the second and third stacks.  \n\nA REAL gauss gun works by exploiting the hysteresis effect.  Which is basically, when an electromagnet creates a field around something made out of iron, that iron develops its own field to counter the imposed field, but when the field is removed, the iron still maintains its own field for a short period of time.  This can be used to suck the piece of iron into a solenoid and expel it at great speed.  You can see a demonstration [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m86gK-EOEsQ)"},

It's become somewhat of a struggle with trying to learn from watching others play.","answer":"As long as you're playing E and G and B, it's an Em chord. As others have pointed out, when you mess with which E, G, and B you're playing (maybe you play B below E or something) that's called an inversion. There are lots of reasons why you might like to use a different inversion in your composition. Here's one that no one's brought up yet: consider the chord progression G D Em C. That's a pretty commonly used progression in pop music; in fact it might be the very most commonly used one, or at least top 3. If you played the first inversion of each chord you'd be playing\n\n     G  B  D\n     D  F# A\n     E  G  B\n     C  E  G\n\nIf you have a piano, play that and see what it sounds like. Now look what happens when you change the D to the second inversion.  \n\n     G  B  D\n     F# A  D\n     E  G  B\n     C  E  G\n\nIf you play that, you'll notice that although they're the same notes, inverting the D makes the progression qualitatively different. You'll notice this especially if you play the bass note of each chord an octave lower. Then in the second case we have the bass note going down a semitone from the G to the D, rather than going up a fifth. Then moving from the D to the Em, it sounds like we're going *down* from D to Em, even though E is a tone up from D. It gives the first three chords kind of a feeling of descending, whereas without the inversion it sounds more like they are ascending."},

A female cop dressed as a prostitute and waiting for a man to come up and ask about the price of sex is not entrapment, because he was clearly already looking to hire a prostitute.\n\nAnother man at a stoplight, approached by the same undercover police officer and actively propositioned for sex, would be entrapment.  He was a regular person sitting at a stoplight or stop sign, and until approached and questioned about wanting to exchange money for sex, may have not intended in the least to ever do so.\n\nThe undercover officers can't be charged with prostitution because they never intentionally or knowingly sold themselves out for sex.  Their intent was entirely to bust the people who are soliciting the services of prostitutes.  The exchange of sexual favors for monetary gain was never there in the first place.\n\nIt's the same thing with drug stings.

For example, Apple's stock may go up because a new iPhone came out, even if the rest of the market is going down. By grouping lots of stocks together, on average you can see how the stock market is doing.\n\nThe DOW (or Dow Jones Industrial Average) is an index of the so-called 'blue chips', or some of the biggest companies in the US.

Rather than being based in a physical location, all of the trading is done online. Since the NASDAQ is a much more tech-savy exchange, many of the companies on it are high-tech firms.

This is rather slow. It's also not very good if your computer were to blow up half way through. You could probably get a bigger computer, that might be a bit faster.

But the bit where we have to organise machines to do the work, and handle when they blow up and not lose any data is difficult - and that's the bit where Hadoop comes in. It will do most of the business of telling which computers are working on what, giving them the news articles they need to read, and telling them where to put their final tally so we can add it up at the end.

When you buy a website, somewhere, someone has to host all of the files that make your website. The ISP reads those files from whoever has them, and sends them to you. All in a matter of seconds. Neat huh? That's because there's a super big list of websites and their location (IP address) called the DNS. ISPs use that to quickly find the server for a website. This means all computers that make the internet are all connected to each other physically. So how do they go overseas? The eastern world has internet too.

{"title":"ELI5: History of Brain research","question_detail":"I've been wondering about the brain for a while now, with my biggest question being: How did the researchers knew that parts of the brain had a specific function?

Or is there still a possibility that all of the knwoledge on the brain is wrong?","answer":"Most of the early knowledge of brain function came from correlating loss-of-function with specific types of brain damage (usually post-mortem). Often this tells you nothing, but occasionally you get lucky. For example, Pierre Broca discovered the region of the brain that is important for speech production (coincidentally called [Broca's area](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broca's_area) ) through autopsies of patients with impaired speech. Going back even further, the Greek physician Galen first established that the brain was important for thinking (a competing school of thought was that intellect was housed in the heart) by examining gladiators who got maimed in the noggin.\n\nMultiply this slow accumulation of knowledge by 100s of years and Viola!

Such a situation would undoubtedly lead to widespread questioning of the legitimacy of the election and, potentially, a public backlash against the victorious Republican candidate and the GOP itself. Before engaging in a cynical attempt to rig the electoral system, Republican leaders and strategists should consider the potential harm that their actions could do to our democratic form of government and to their own party.*","answer":"Basically you change the voting boundries (the border between congressional districts) so that your party wins by a small margin in a lot of seats but loses a lot in a minority of seats."},

{"title":"[ELI5] Why do people think cell phones/wifi causes cancer? ","answer":"Sorry for the long post, my ELI5 is near the end. \n\nIt's hard to say where the idea began, but there are a few key themes:\n\n1) Radiation. Everyone talks about how cell phones operate on radio waves and reports of it causing cancer sometimes call it \"radiation\". This is...sort of correct. They *are* electromagnetic radiation, but so are many other things, including radios, satellite signals, and so on. It also ignores the fact that cell phone and wifi waves are too \"large\" to fit between skin cells. \n\n2) Circumstantial evidence and popular \"stories\". These sound like they link cancer to cell phone use, but they are not actual hard evidence and can have many alternate explanations. For example, my mom is a neurologist and had a patient who used to work for CCIS (Canada's secret service). They got a brain tumour exactly around beside device installed in their ear that received radio signals (for covert communication). However, my mother, instead of jumping to the conclusion that it was the signals that caused it, said that it could be anything from mere coincidence since the patient had a family history of brain tumours, to the metals and materials used in the device (this was decades ago, after all). Another example are the many stories of people who \"use their cell phone all the time\" and then get tumours near their ear. Well...yeah. Everyone uses cellphones all the time and, by random chance, a few of them will develop tumours near where they put their cell phone. They confuse circumstantial evidence for actual evidence. *Everyone* does this all the time, usually without even realizing it. I find it takes either university, dedication in high school, or learning from experience to beat it out of them. \n\n3) They don't know what causes cancer. Cancer is caused by cell mutation. However, cell phone signals have not been conclusively proven to cause cell mutation. This is because the strength and frequency of cell phone radiation aren't enough to break down chemical and genetic structures. People who believe they cause cancer either deny or are simply unaware of this fact. \n\n4) There are also a bunch of stuff about how people can be afraid of technology and therefore blame society's ills on technology, which has some merit but probably isn't a root cause. \n\n5) They started believing it and are now in the habit of believing it. My use of \"habit\" is key here. Once someone believes something, it takes a lot of effort and experience for them to believe something else. It is very hard for most people to change their belief in the short term and, the longer they go without questioning something, the less likely it is for them to be convinced otherwise. Many people who started believing cell phones cause cancer back when they were new, mysterious, and relatively unknown things aren't willing to change their opinion.\n\n[Here](http://www.dropeik.com/risk_excerpt.html) is a good article outlining the issue. \n\nELI5: People sometimes believe things because they don't know everything about the topic, which is hardly their fault, or because they refuse to believe facts because they are convinced they are right. They also don't know what is good or bad evidence which, again, is not always their fault. "},

Specifically countries such as Isreael / palestine / jordan / syria / iran / iraq / afghanistan / lebanon / yemen / saudi arabia. This part of the world facinates me!","answer":"Disclaimer: I am conservative and I am not an expert on the subject.\n\nAlso, I am over-simplifying things because this is ELI5.\n\nBut...\n\nIsrael/Palestine: \n\nIsrael was basically a make-up gift to the Jewish people from the world for the holocaust. \n\nPalestine is an adjacent country populated mostly by Muslims. They are ruled by the terrorist group Hamas. \n\nHamas' foundation can be linked directly to Hitler. When Hitler was rising to power but had not yet blatantly stated his goal of wiping the Jews of the planet, he met with a radical Muslim and basically encouraged him to start Hamas. \n\nAnyway, Palestine wants the land because they had it before it was gifted to the Jewish people. The main stream media will tell you this is legitimate, and perhaps it is (the Jews owned the land before the Palestinians, but the Palestinians did fairly win it from the Jews [if you consider war fair]). However you feel about this, that is not the whole story. Hamas' stated goal (it's in their constitution) is to destroy Israel. They  believe Jews are sub-human, descendants of \"apes and pigs\". For years they have bombed Israel. Israel has signed compromise after compromise to give Palestine more land, but the Palestinians wouldn't stop, so the Israelites (and the Palestinians [sort of]) built a big wall in between the nations, and tensions progressively got worse as bombs continued to fall.\n\nThen, as the US's support of Israel waned (the US is pretty much the only reason Israel has avoided a second holocaust), and Iran, an ally of Hamas (not officially, but they are run by people who hate Jews and Westerners [they call the US \"Satan's land\"] like Hamas), were rumored of building nukes, Israel decided to go on the offensive and bomb Palestine. Despite the fact that Hamas has consistently bombed Israel for years, the US media jumped all over Israel. \n\nOne reason for this, is because Israel was bombing at Palestine schools and civility areas. However, they were doing this because Hamas was setting up their \"bombing devices\" in these areas. If Israel didn't shoot at what was shooting them, it would be suicide. This shows how little Hamas actually care about its people. Also, several videos of dead, Palestinian children were leaked to the US media. These videos were proved to be fake (the children were pretending to be dead, or, sadly, the kids were actually killed by rogue Hamas bombs.\n\nEventually, Israel got a big gun that could shoot down any of Palestine's big bombs, so the two sides reached a treaty. However, it won't last long.\n\nMeanwhile, Egypt's dictatorship was recently overthrown. Morsi, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood (and was supported by Obama), won election. He recently passed a constitution basically making him a dictator and taking away a bunch of rights of the people. So the people and the military may over throw him soon. Morsi is also a 9/11 truther, said to be the mastermind behind a failed NJ terrorist attack on a bunch of bridges, and, worst, has called Jews and Americans \"apes and pigs\". He has said he wants to destroy Israel and America. Despite all this, Obama wants him to be the negotiator or middleman in the Israel/Palestine conflict. \n\nWorse yet, in the last week, the Obama admin has given Morsi ~100 of the military jets, as well as ground vehicles. For what? Exactly.\n\nJordan is Israel's only ally in the region, but does not have much influence on anything. \n\nSyria had some sort of rebellion sometime in the last 2 years. The controversy there was that Obama sent troops without the authorization of Congress. \n\nWe're still in Iraq (should have never gone) but are yet to reach an agreement with their government to leave.\n\nNot sure about the others.\n\nAlso, the Benghazi scandal:\ngoogle it\n"},

It seems so random, that you wouldn't want to drive on any roads. Is there a way they can stop/avoid this? ","answer":"A bunch of what we do to protect against IEDs is classified.  We don't necessarily want to give away all our tricks.  That said there is a chain in the process of detonating an IED and the Army tries its best to break each link of the chain.  Concealed weapons are unfortunately very hard to find before they are used.\n\nFirst you need to have materials.  Smuggled fertilizer used in bombs is regularly confiscated at borders.  Copper cones, used in shaped charges and explosively formed penetrators are agressively hunted.  There are bounties for old mortar and artillery rounds that have accumulated in country after over 35 years of fighting.\n\nNext you need the know how to build a bomb.  We focus on the guys with the know how to make a bomb since they're much rarer than the guys who actually do the bombings.  We use forensics to find out who made it, and bring them in if we can find them.  We also seed misinformation, and many would-be bombmakers have blown themselves up.\n\nYou need to place the assembled bomb.  Drones watch the roads for men doing digging.  We map places where bombs have been found before.  Signs of nefarious activity can lead to a preempting strike with artillery, missiles, or bombs.\n\nYou need to trigger the bomb.  The Army jams radio communications, uses infrared decoys, and keeps an eye out for triggermen and their tools like wires or aiming stakes.\n\nYour bomb needs to cause casualties.  Armored vehicles with V hulls do a good job absorbing the force of an explosion.  Good tactics will keep multiple vehicles from being hit in a blast.  Troops wear body armor, protective gear, and fire resistant clothing that limit blast effectiveness.\n\n"},

Thank You.","answer":"[Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_absorption_spectroscopy) relies on the fact that within an atom, the electrons can only absorb certain wavelengths (colors) of light.  So if you shine a bunch of different light wavelengths at an atom all at once (white light) and see what wavelengths it absorbs, it's kind of a fingerprint for that element.  No two elements will absorb the exact same set of wavelengths.   \n  \nTo make this work, you have to \"atomize\" the sample with something like high heat and/or an electric arc.   \n  \nTo get the concentration of an element in the sample, there's an [equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer-Lambert_Law) you use to relate the absorbance to concentration. \n   \nI don't know anything about stripping analysis.

{"title":"Why is China always referred to as a communist country when they are very capitalist?","question_detail":"China is full of low wages, high output, ridiculously specialized jobs (factory workers), which yields inexpensive products. This seems to be a more pure example of capitalism than any other example in history. So why is China always referred to as communist?","answer":"China was conquered by a Communist army led by Mao Zedong in 1949. From 1949 to the late 1970s, it was run like a completely by the book Communist country, as other posters have described. \n\nTrouble was, Communism is a shitty way to run an economy, and by the late 70s Mao was dead and his successors were willing to open up a little and introduce some capitalist reforms in order to help it along. This worked pretty well, and so by the late 1980s and 1990s they had relaxed the rules a whole hell of a lot, economy-wise, so that in many ways China was almost as capitalist as the West.\n\nBut there were and are some important differences. For one, all this rule-loosening was *strictly* on the business side of things  --- not on the politics side. There is one political party in China, and it's the Communist party. No free press, no elections, none of that stuff. \n\nTwo, even though the state was letting more and more people do their own thing in order to create successful businesses, the state didn't stop doing stuff itself. It still owns plenty of factories, businesses, real estate, etc. And it still has plenty of say in every aspect of how every other company gets run. Basically, you need government approval for everything, and if the government wants to do something it gets done --- there's no individual proprty rights, which many people regard as fundamental to a successful capitalist society. Some government official wants to knock down your house so his buddy can put a highway there, it happens, and you're lucky if you get some money for it. \n\nNot to say there aren't shady, buddy-buddy dealings in the West.

{"title":"ELI5: How do websites automatically know what city you are in?","answer":"There are a few different options that are available for web programmers to identify a visitor's location:\n\n\nIn the past there were providers that offered geolocation services by querying databases of IP addresses with records of blocks that had been issued to ISPs in different areas. So when you visit a site, the site can make a call to a geolocation service (or its own database) to try to get your approximate location. This still works well for most applications that just need a simple approximation of your area and is handled by the server hosting the site.\n\n\nNow in HTML5 the WC3 Geolocation API is beginning to become more commonplace (although not supported by all browsers). Browsers that do support it can make a location request to their ISP which is directed to a nearby Location Information Server which provides location information for web apps as well as 911 service. Using a combination of it's own database as well as wiremapping, the LIS is able to return a fairly accurate approximate location of where the request is coming from. This method is actually handled by your browser which passes the information back to the server with cookies or javascript.\n\n\nThe second option is being used more and more by web services because it is built right into the network and doesn't require 3rd party services and possibly outdated databases of IP addresses. If you're using google chrome and see a message about a site wanting to know your location this is what it's."},

All the data that comprises this video/song/extreme porn is going through my computer to play it, right? For me to see it, it must all be there.

Why do i have to go through the whole process of a 'youtube downloader' that emails it to me, or a chome/IE add-in, or torrenting my porn?\n\nthanks!","answer":"A lot of streaming video, like youtube, is like reading a book by being handed one page at a time, and after each page you tear up that one and throw it away before you get handed the next one. This is efficient for Youtube because they only have to lift one page at a time, not an entire book. The entire book passes through your hands eventually, but actually having the whole book all at once, so you can give it to someone else, takes more effort - you'd have to copy each page as it passes through your hands.

Rhythm and Hues, one of the largest and best VFX studios in the US filing for bankruptcy. \n\n2. Protest at the Oscars, and Rhythm and Hues being cut off the stage in the middle of their speech (their chance to get their voice heard) after they won Best Visual Effects for Life of Pi.\n\nRhythm and Hues has seen the worst of it. But seemingly all VFX studios, whether they're in LA, Canada, or the UK have been doing pretty bad. So what's going on with the VFX industry? I've heard a lot of words going around.

{"title":"ELI5: Why companies having access to your browsing habits and why targeted ads are bad things. ","question_detail":"First of all, I assume these companies don't have a live person specifically look through your browsing habits/history, and instead it all works through algorithms and code. When you look up \"hemorrhoid cream\", I assume there isn't some guy going, \"Ha! Look at this guy!\" And isn't the only incentive to do this in the first place to simply have targeted ads geared specifically towards you? Maybe ads will actually be useful and I'll know about good deals on electronic cigarettes or musical instruments or whatever else I'm interested in. \n\nSurely, however, there are some downsides as so many people are opposed to it. Can anyone explain what they are? ","answer":"There are three primary issues\n  \n 1. the information lives forever\n 2. Anyone with enough money can get that information, and the barrier to entry is getting lower each day.\n 3. that information can be used to hurt you as well as help you.\n\nEmployers, Insurance Companies, etc., love to gather as much info as they can before dealing with someone.  And what they are usually looking for is a reason to not deal with you.  Let's take an example:\n\nWhen you lookup \"hemorrhoid cream\", you may eventually be tagged as a user with a possible medical problem.  If you go on to buy hemorrhoid cream, either online or in an actual store using a credit card, that info is also linked.  This information will be factored into a overall statistical score of the likeliness of a user to have a medical condition.  An employer can purchase that info and see a model of how much his group employee insurance policy will rise if he hires you and chose not to hire you.  An insurance company gets this info and sends it to underwriting where you premium is adjusted upward or the policy is cancelled (or worse, used to deny coverage citing a preexisting condition that was not disclosed)\n\nHow much of the above scenario is active today is hard to say.  The technology certainly exists as does the raw data itself; the only uncertainty is how effectively it is being used.  Data mining is a young industry, as I suspect that currently most data is used only in aggregate.  However, this will change in the future, and remember issue #1:  this information lives forever.\n\nAnd that's the real problem.  Once your browsing habits are gathered, the data just sits there waiting for somebody to come along to abuse it, and by then there is absolutely nothing you can do to stop it.\n"},

Right now the most popular one is Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM).  It basically works like an inkjet printer.  Inkjet printers will print one line on a pass. FDM 3D printers will print one contour or cross-section on a pass. There is a nozzle that melted plastic is squeezed through to produce your 3D model. It stacks layer by layer until your part is complete. If your part is somewhat complex and has overhangs or holes, the 3D printer will also supply a disposable support material to help prop up your part while it's being printed.  "},

I feel like a real idiot now. Sorry :( ","answer":"First of all, I really like the idea of Spore.  It was inspired by the IBM film *[Powers of Ten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0)* [9:01], which is worth a watch, if you didn't see it in school.  The idea is that at each level of evolution you are zooming out by another power, so you would really get an idea of the scale of the universe.\n\nUnfortunately, the game had a disjointed feel that made it play like a series of mini-games topped with a space RTS.  This wasn't really how the game was marketed, and it was massively hyped for years before release, so fans were mostly disappointed.  \n\nAnother potential factor is that EA decided to encumber Spore with aggressive DRM, which has been accused of containing malware.  EA also limited the number of times the game could be installed.  As a result, many fans decided to download the cracked version (which came with the DRM removed) in protest.  This caused the TorrentFreak website to name Spore as *Most pirated video game of 2008*.  Unfortunately, EA did not learn their lesson and chose to employ an even more aggressive form of 'always-on' DRM with Simcity (presumably because retina scans and DNA tests were unavailable) which has resulted in possibly the worst video game launch in history.\n\nIn a way, Spore was the last game of its kind. The principle behind Spore was that players would create content for each other that was freely distributed through EA's servers.  Today, it is far more profitable for a game company to release a half-finished game, prevent user-created content and mods and sell the rest of it piecemeal through micro-transactions and DLC."},

This is to break a signal down into smaller parts, so you can transmit each one individually, then put it back together once they all reach the the indented target.\n\nIn short. \n\nThe old method you'd want to talk to say New york from berlin. So you'd have to get a single connection, one wire from your office in new york, to your buddy in berlin. Once you get everyone along the way to set up each switch (literally), then you transmit. \n\nThe packet system is you send your message, then its broken up into lets say 5 second intervals for simplicity sake.

It's used as a way to show your interest in another person, and gauge their response, without risking potential embarrassment of an outright rejection.  It often starts very mildly, such as a small compliment, or non-verbal communication such as physical closeness, eye contact, and smiling.  If the other person is not inclined they simply won't return the behavior, if they are, they will tend to.  If they don't reciprocate, the initial behavior can simply be dropped without comment, or laughed off as a joke.\n\nNo one decides on how flirting is done, different people will approach it in different ways, but they all are mechanisms for subtly showing your potential interest.

{"title":"ELI5: Refresh rate (Hz) of TVs/monitors","answer":"A video is just a series of images swapped in and out so fast that it looks like a video.  A refresh rate represents how fast a TV can redraw the image. At a certain refresh rate the human eye can no longer differentiate between images in video.\n\nTV's use different technologies to draw these images, and different technologies have different problems. Some go completely black between drawing images. Some draw over what was already there. Some have to \"clear\" each pixel when drawing.  All of these create different effects. \n\nThis is why if you see video cameras recording TV shows (especially older large tube TVs) you'll see a line in the screen slowly moving down. This is because the video camera is picking up the screen refreshing, but you're not. Note you'll only see this if the refresh rate and the recording frame rate are out of sync.\n\nNote this is different than FPS or frames per second. Generally FPS refers to how fast software can decode (or render) a scene. "},

The best way to get rid of it is doing something like the master cleanse or any juice fast/colon cleanse really. \n\nTotally serious\n\nToo many carbs cause an insulin spike which causes more oil on our skin.   Then the quick drop in blood sugar causes hormones called androgens to be released which causes a craving for more sugar/carbs.  Androgens also cause more oil to be made on our skin.

{"title":"ELI5: The inbound fly rule","question_detail":"I am a kiwi, and I can't work out the inbound fly rule in baseball. ","answer":"I believe you mean infield fly rule, like l0adt0ad says. However, to explain like you are five: \n\nThere are two ways to get someone out once they have hit the baseball. The first is to catch the ball they've hit before it hits the ground--once this happens, the play ends and all other runners must return to the base they were on at the beginning of the play. \n\nThe second way to get out is to be tagged at the base by someone holding the baseball. If someone is tagged out at the base, they are out, but the play continues. So, all the other runners must choose to either continue running and try to reach the next base, or turn around and try to get back to their original base. In cases like this, it is possible for the fielding team to act quickly and tag out two (double play) or even three (triple play) runners in the same play. \n\nThis is where the infield fly rule comes in. Say you have a runner on first and another on second, and the batter hits the ball, high up into the air at a ~75 degree angle (this kind of hit is called a \"fly\" ball.) The ball is going to spend a few seconds in the air and then fall back down inside the diamond (infield). If the fielding team catches the ball, the batter is out and both runners must return to first and second. However, this only gets them one out. Sometimes a fielder may choose to drop the ball in order to keep the play alive and try to go for a quick and easy double play. \n\nThe infield fly rule simply says that in this scenario, a \"fly ball\" hit inside the diamond will *automatically* count as an out, to prevent the infielders from dropping it on purpose in hopes of getting additional outs.

Although there are things called epigenetics where the environment that the egg and sperm were first made in can have influences.\n\n&gt;most likely to determine how the offspring develops\n\nDefinitely the female. All the development happens in the uterus for 40 weeks (ideally).\n\nSperm hits the cervix. The cervix will sort of sit in the pool of sperm in the back of the vagina. It will work its way through the hole of the cervix and into the uterus. From there the sperm (through a mechanism that really isn't still 100% understood) makes its where to the Fallopian tube. A few days ago, the egg will have already been released from the ovary into the Fallopian tube where it meets the sperm. The sperm and egg fuse to make a zygote.

{"title":"ELI5: When the input cable of my amp is unplugged when it is on, why is there that loud buzzing sound?","answer":"The input cable is shielded, but the connector is not, so the tip is acting as an antenna for interference. There is always a lot of radio frequency noise that can interfere with devices. All electronic devices put out some kind of noise; this includes florescent lights, power adapters, computers, and even toasters. As well, there is radio interference from television, radios, cell phones and other devices. This interference is always there and is not harmful to humans.\n\nNow, as far as why it happens with your microphone (or guitar/instrument) but not other audio systems is because of sensitivity. A microphone amp must be very sensitive to pick up the fine movements of a diaphragm or coil (main component of a microphone), because it is an electrical signal _generated_ by sound waves hitting a cone that moves a coil. However, your computer speakers, for example, may only receive a \"line input\" which is a very low impedance, relatively high current signal. \n\nThe above is a brutally simple explanation.

Does our brain just derp on itself due to the sudden impact?","answer":"Inside our ears are 3 [semicircular canals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicircular_canal), basically tubes of fluid with tiny hairs that governs our sense of balance.\n\nWhen the head is struck by something, the shock can cause a concussion which causes impaired neurotransmission in the brain as a way to protect or repair itself. \n\nSo before the ball hits, your brain is receiving information that your balance is normal. But the shock of the ball hitting causes your brain to shut down for a fraction of a second and the canals to be giving out non-nonsensical information.\n\nThe force of the object causes your body to tip and your brain is not able to compensate in time by shifting your legs to re-balance yourself.

{"title":"ELI5: How do fossil fuels go from dead animals to an energy source?","answer":"Dead animals and living animals for that matter are made up of carbon. So are plants for that matter. Not entirely, of course. The human body is 18.5% carbon, by weight according to my biology textbook. All of this carbon comes directly from the atmosphere, in the form of carbon dioxide. This is absorbed by plants during photosynthesis and we eat it, or we eat other animals that ate it and absorb it into ourselves. It becomes a part of us. When animals and plants die, this carbon decomposes, but not all of it. After \"millions and millions\" of years these carbon reservoirs exist in the form of coal mines, oil and natural gas. These fossil fuels can be burned for a release of energy. The body \"burns\" these fuels in similar ways.

{"title":"ELI5: Linux/Unix filesystems","answer":"Files are simply addresses to locations on your hard drive. Folders are a collection of those addresses. Let us say you have a 2KB readme.txt file, a file system will map it to a block number like 4081. Obviously a given computer is likely to have multiple readme.txts, so instead of forcing you to name each file uniquely folders allow you to breakup files into a hierarchy. \n\nMost of the time files larger than 4KB will be stored on multiple blocks. So a video file might be stored on blocks 4082-7001. But, what if you already have a few files stored in the 6000 blocks, and your hard drive is mostly full? In Windows your video file would be split up and stored on multiple block ranges, which is called \"fragmentation\". In most *NIX systems the files already stored in the 6000 blocks will actually be moved before the new file is written or shortly there after. Why is that? Regular hard drives are like CDs. Data is stored on a circular platter, and in order to read it you need to spin the disk and position the laser/head on the right spot. If you split your file up into multiple block ranges the head will then have to physically move a few times to read a file. This is slow. That is why Windows has a defragmentation utility, while Linux does not.\n\nIn Windows, drive letters are really just shortcuts to a folder, the root folder of each drive. This is kind of an arbitrary decision on Windows part, and inherently inflexible. In *NIX a drive can can be mapped to any folder. If you have all of you Music on one hard drive, and all of you video on another, you could mount them both inside of your media/ folder and thus keep them in one place. \n\nFile systems arguably suck, and pretty much the only reason we still have them today is for legacy support. Microsoft actually tried to get replace filesystems back in the early 2000s with an inherently more flexible system called WinFS. Instead of storing files in a hierarchical system, all files were stored in a flat database but referenced with tags. Imagine you took photos on a business &amp; family trip to New Zealand back in 06. Instead of searching through multiple folders, like family trips, 2006, etc. in search of the one arbitrary place you actually put those images, WinFS allowed you to tag files (similar to gmail tags). So in order to find those photos, you could click on Family Trips tag, or 2006, or New Zealand... Cool, right? There are also many technical reasons why databases are better, like search speed and less overhead. Unfortunately, most software would break without a filesystem, and would have to be rewritten. Hence why WinFS was abandoned.\n\nNotes: For the sake of simplicity I did not address certain technicalities, like differentiating between a file system and partition formats. I also did not elaborate on certain things, like how *NIX sometimes have slower write speeds because of auto defragmentation. Edit: Grammar."},

The bigger the aperture, the more light comes in, and the faster shutter you can use - and the tradeoff is that your \"band\" of focus becomes much thinner (so while the eyes are in focus, the ears are blurred-sort-of-thing), and that objectives with large apertures typically are more expensive)\n\nSecond-hand lenses are most often a good deal - I bought into Sony's alpha-line, because it was compatible with old Minolta A-mounts.\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: I need some help in understanding voltage/potential difference, current, and other things like that.","question_detail":"There are similar questions already asked, but they are not specific enough.\n\nMy current 'understanding':\n\nCurrent is the number of electrons passing a point in a second.\n\nPotential difference is the amount of work an electron/unit of charge can do over the course of the circuit.  It has to be exactly right, in that V will reduce to 0 by the end.\n\nTherefore, if one wanted to light a light bulb, they would either need a lot of electrons with low potential difference, or fewer electrons with a higher potential difference.\n\nWhy, therefore, for all that is holy, is the equation V=IR a thing?  If you increase the current, the potential difference goes up.  But surely this is completely unnecessary?  You need a certain amount of work done over the circuit, and that can either be achieved through lots of electrons with low energy, or fewer, but with more energy each.\n\nI think it comes down to a fundamental lack of understanding of pd.  I don't see why, if V=W/Q, the energy transfer doesn't become less efficient as you go round the circuit.  V decreases, therefore the work per charge goes down, thus, less efficient.\n\nPlease be kind, I've spent a couple of hours researching already, and I really am struggling to understand.\n\nThanks very much.","answer":"You can't think of things like \"work per charge\" when you're doing circuit analysis, or you'll work yourself into problems like this. Don't think of individual electrons, think of the aggregate behavior of all of the electrons in the circuit. They're all pushing on each other, so the amount of energy that each *individual* charge has doesn't particularly matter.\n\nAnyway, you are correct that you can do the same amount of work either with tons of \"low-energy electrons\" or a few \"high-energy\" ones. The relationship for power is p=iV, and the unit is watts, which is joules/second. If your goal is to supply 10W of power, you can tweak the voltage and current however you want in order to get there, it doesn't matter from a theoretical perspective.\n\nWhat happens, though, is that any \"load\" you're trying to drive, such as a lightbulb, has an internal resistance (or, more properly, an impedance).\n\nLet's imagine that lightbulbs are purely resistive (they aren't but that's not important). If your 10W bulb has the same internal resistance as a 10 ohm resistor, you need to supply a *specific* amount of voltage and current because of V=iR. If you give it 20V, there'll be 20V and 2A over the lightbulb, which is 40W, and it'll blow out. You need to supply it with 10V, because then, it'll have 10V and 1A through it for 10W."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why the speed of light is the limiting factor of the Universe","answer":"An object with mass takes an infinite amount of energy to get accelerated to the speed of light, and can thus never reach it. The formula is [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/1/2/412ab03eb3152e6accb8600a2634ff91.png), where Ek is (kinetic) energy, m is mass, c is the speed of light, and v is speed.

There can be a difference in how robust a cable is against e.g. rubbing agains sharp edges, or how often the connectors can be used until they wear out.\n\nBut normally a cable is connected not very often and just lies there, so there is no point in buying a fancy cable that would survive constant connecting/disconnecting and mechanical abuse.\n\nEverybody that says things like \"hurr durr, digital signal still travel over an analog copper cable\" ([example](http://www.monstercable.com/hdmi/hdmi.asp)) are technically correct, but beside their point: As long as you don't live in factory where huge electrical motors create tons of electrical noise, or your DVD player stands meters away from your TV the cheapest cable will do the job.\n\ntl;dr: things like hdmi monster cables are a scam"},

{"title":"ELI5: What is scientific socialism ?","question_detail":"I need to know what it truly means ! You know, finals. ","answer":"Scientific socialism is a way of striving toward socialism. Basically, people wanted to replace the current political-economic systems with a new system where people collectively owned the things they needed to do their work (factories, land, investment capital, mines, oil refineries, etc) so that the direction and efforts of society would be democratically controlled by everyone. This system is called socialism, and it's considered the first part of a development that ends with the dissolution of the state.\n\nBut how do you actually get there?\n\nThe big movement in France and England in the 1800s was Utopian Socialism. The idea there was that you created small socialist projects, like co-operative factories, mills, etc, in the style of [New Lanark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Lanark#History). Read that History section, it'll give you a good overview of the ideas of utopian socialism. Their intent was that small socialist projects would attract attention and support, become the talk of the town, and eventually the entire country would go socialist, and then the world.\n\nBut this failed. \n\nSo these two guys called Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels come along, and their idea is to combine three fields of study from around Europe: apply German philosophy (Hegel etc) and English economic theory (Adam Smith, David Ricardo, etc) to the ideas of French utopian socialism. They combined these three things into a lot of critiques analysing how society moves and develops across different stages (primitivism -&gt; master/slave -&gt; feudalism -&gt; mercantilism -&gt; capitalism and so on), how society is structured along different lines (commoners, clergy, aristocrats in France, highborn, lowborn and slaves in Rome, men and women, owners and workers), and especially how capitalism operates. (These analyses are why Marx is often called the \"father of sociology.\")\n\nThey did this because they were trying to root the socialist movement in the scientific method. Rather than say \"Hey, this would be cool, let's try that!\", he was trying to come up with a detailed analysis of the major areas of society and of the revolutionary movement. The idea was that you'd make observations about the functioning and structure of the social culture, economics, classes, etc, and then come up with theories and strategies for changing society. These observations and strategies would be falsifiable -- either they'd work, and you'd make them a permanent part of your thinking, or they'd fail, and you'd rule them out and try something new. The utopian movements, they said, had failed because they made no analysis of different forces in society, and the powerful people -- who had become powerful through capitalism and wealth -- were obviously opposed to changing the system that made them rich and powerful, and so had used their power to shut the socialists down. You've got to take things like that into account. Their philosophy emphasised materialism (looking at the physical, tactical, technological and economic conditions of past societies as the primary drive of their movement), forms of logic, and sociological theories based on evolution, amongst other things they considered scientific.\n\n"},

The disease has an overall familial recurrence rate of 20%. In the case of monozygotic twins, concordance occurs only in about 35% of cases, while it goes down to around 5% in the case of siblings and even lower in half-siblings.

The most I can gather is that he performed abortions that were either dangerous to the mother or cruel to the basically born children that he aborted.","answer":"People have issues with abortion especially if the fetus was capable to survive by itself once removed and thus suddenly called a \"baby\" by some. So while this was still abortion as in it happened before baby came out by itself, these so called babies were killed. Opponents equate this to killing children. Others do not think of the fetuses as people since people require interaction with others and environment to form and develop personalities, while these were immediately killed after removal. It isn't clear what would've happened if the fetuses were killed before removal. It is in fact illegal in that state to perform abortions that late, so he was breaking the law. He also prescribed too much painkiller which led to a woman's death. If it was ethical or not is up for debate depending on if you think protecting unintelligent life is important or only protecting formed people.\n\nNow the bias: I think Dr. Kermit Gosnell is a hero who broke unfair laws and did the moral thing by helping people not create new people they can't support, but screwed up a prescription for the lady which I can't defend. He was also vilified in the matter similar to witch burning where fairy tales dictate laws instead of logic.

{"title":"[ELI5] Why don't computers with faster processors run games at ridiculous speeds, or at least faster than other computers?","question_detail":"Basically, if you're taking a game that runs relatively well on a budget computer, why doesn't it run sped up on a supercomputer with a ridiculously fast processor?\n\nEDIT: Obviously, programs compensate somehow. But how?","answer":"Most games execute a loop in which they read inputs, calculate the new positions of objects on the screen, check for collisions and then draw something on the screen.\n\n\nThe game keeps track of how much time has passed since the last time the loop was executed by reading the system clock, so if you're playing a racing simulation, the game knows the car is supposed to be travelling at say 100 feet per second, and it knows it has been 10 milliseconds since the loop was last executed, so it's going to draw the car 1 foot further down the track.\n\n\nIf you run the same game on a computer that's a lot slower, the same loop may take 40 milliseconds to execute, and the game would draw the car 4 feet further down the track.\n\n\nOn the slow computer you get 25 position updates or frames per second. On the fast computer you get 100 frames per second, so it looks smoother because the position of the car changes in smaller steps, but the car appears to be travelling at the same speed.\n\n\nIf the game's main loop takes less than one millisecond to execute (which can be the case if you run really old games on fast computers), this approach may not work, because the system clock doesn't provide the necessary resolution. If 0.6 ms gets rounded to 1 ms, the game will be running too fast. If 0.4 ms gets rounded to 0 ms, the game may even crash. To calculate how much an object has moved since the last time it was updated, you'd use (object_speed / time_since_last_update), and if time_since_last_update is zero, the game will crash because you can't divide by zero."},

I'm taking ACG2021 (Financial Accounting) and I just can't seem to grasp the concept of debits and credits. I found a seemingly well written response on Yahoo Answers, but for some reason it's just not sticking. Any help?\n\nFor reference, here's the Yahoo Answers page: http://in.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090524043059AAhtsFh","answer":"First, you have to remember that in accounting\n\nASSETS = LIABILITIES + OWNER'S EQUITY\n\nSo to get an asset, for example, you have to either take out a loan, or show an investment of capital from an owner.\n\nIt also helps to know that OWNER'S EQUITY = Capital Contributitions + Retained Earnings.\n\nRetained earnings are essentially a carry-over of each year's net income or loss.\n\nRETAINED EARNINGS = REVENUES - EXPENSES\n\nPlugging all of that in you can expand the basic equation to\n\nAssets = Liabilities + Capital Contributions + Revenue - Expenses - Dividends\n\nThat equation ALWAYS has to be in balance.\n\nDebits and credits are how you add/subtract from accounts that fall into the categories in that expanded equation.\n\nThe main thing you need to know now, is that the LEFT side of the equation increases with DEBITS and the RIGHT side increases with CREDITS.\n\n(That means that Expenses and Dividends are actually DEBITS as well, when incurred, since they DECREASE the right side of the equation).\n\nAn example:\n\nSuppose you start a company and you get a $100 loan to run the company.\n\nYou now have an asset and a liability.  Your asset is the cash.  The liability is the loan.\n\nYour left side of the equation (assets) goes up to $100 because you got the cash.\n\n100 = LIABILITIES + OWNERS EQUITY\n\nThe right side has to stay in balance, and you now have a liability that would be on that side.  Your owner's equity is unchanged.\n\n100 = 100 + 0\n\nThe debits and credits are used to express what happened with what's called a journal entry.\n\nBecause cash is an asset and the assets are on the left, you DEBIT those when they INCREASE.  Because the loan is a liability which is on the right of the equation, you CREDIT those when they INCREASE.\n\nSo your entry is\n\nDEBIT: CASH 100\n\n     CREDIT:   LOAN 100"},
{"title":"ELI5: What is the difference between non-rechargeable batteries and rechargeable batteries (besides the fact that one can be recharged)?","answer":"All batteries are briefly-rechargeable, but non-rechargeable batteries will overheat and potentially catch fire when you recharge them, which is bad. \n\nIf you took the stuff inside non-rechargeable batteries out, and put it in a well prepared lab, you could recharge the stuff, then make new batteries with it. We don't because it'd be more expensive than mining new stuff.\n\nAnalogy: \n\nRechargeable buckets: \nYou've got 2 buckets with holes in the bottom, and the holes are connect by a garden hose. And the top bucket is full of water. If you keep the hose open, water will flow down into the 2nd bucket because gravity is pulling on the water. If you plug the hose, that's like breaking the connection between the terminals of the battery. If you lift the bottom bucket above the top bucket, the water will run the other way and that's how you recharge them.\n\nNon-rechargeable buckets:\nYou've got another pair of buckets with a hose, but this time they're filled with dangerous acid and the handles are lousy.

He's playing a self-destructive alcoholic, and alcohol is seen as a strongly negative influence here. So what's going on? Did I not understand the rules properly? Is there some kind of exception in play? Does the Pabst Brewing Company just not give a shit?","answer":"They are allowed to use trademarked products and logos incidentally, they just can't give the appearance the trademark hold is endorsing the movie.  Positive, negative it doesn't matter, so long as they aren't being slanderous.\n\nThey often use fake brands, because negative associations can work both ways.  A lot of people have fierce brand loyalty, a Budweiser drinker might form a negative impression of a Coors drinker, and vice versa...but they both will be indifferent to a Duff drinker.\n\nAlso, using fake brands makes product placement more valuable.

{"title":"ELI5: What's alternation of generations?","question_detail":"for bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms?\n\nreally confused. thanks if you can!","answer":"Alternation of generations, which evolved in land plants, starting with hornworts, liverworts and mosses (bryophytes), is a change in ploidy, which is the number of chromosome sets, between generations. There are two stages of a life cycle involving alternation of generation, the diploid (2n, 2 sets of chromosomes) sporophyte, and the haploid (1n, 1 set of chromosomes) gametophyte.\n\nTo start off, let's say we have a diploid sporophyte. The sporophyte has an organ called a sporangium. At the sporangium, cells undergo meiosis and split up into haploid cells. Sounds familiar, right? This is where the life cycle starts to differ from a human life cycle. Instead of immediately fusing to form a zygote, each of the haploid cells, called spores, develops into a new plant, called a gametophyte. The gametophyte then undergoes mitosis to produce gametes. Gametes from different plants then fuse to form a zygote, which develops into another sporophyte.\nIn some plants, there are gender differences between spores. This trait is called heterospory and it evolved independently multiple times. \nIn the bryophytes,the gametophyte is dominant, meaning that the sporophyte is highly dependent on it.\nIn ferns, which are pteridophytes, both the sporophyte and gametophyte can exist independently. \nSeed plants, like gymnosperms and angiosperms, have dominant sporophytes. The gametophytes are reduced to structures on the sporophyte."},

{"title":"Why is genetic diversity important?","question_detail":"Iv been reading about colonizing other planets and the need for a large gene pool is always brought up, why is this important? Is it to do with interbreeding problems and what causes those problems? (sorry if this isn't the appropriate subreddit I'm not sure if I'd understand a very scientific response)","answer":"Resistance to disease is a major reason for this. In a population of people with similar genetics you run a high risk of rare, recessive diseases cropping up in the population. This is the problem with inbreeding. With recessive disease, you have to have two parents donate the same kind of defective gene in order for it to manifest at all. Otherwise one parent will give a disease gene, while the other parent will give a normal gene and you have a normal, healthy baby. With a large mix of genetics a recessive disease is likely to go unexpressed because of the majority of other individuals having a dominant, healthy gene to 'cover up' the disease. Basically all people are carriers for at least a couple of genetic diseases, and so long as there's an abundant mix of genetics to go around we're unlikely to pair up with another individual who happens to carry the same rare disease.\n\nOn the other hand, in terms of non-genetic diseases a person's genetics help determine a person's immune system and the types of bacteria/microorganisms we're resistant to. If everyone is related due to a small population size, the population is likely to be susceptible to the same diseases. This means that if one of those diseases reaches the population it's likely to be decimated. If, however, there is good genetic diversity then you can expect only a few individuals to die from exposure to the disease. "},

{"title":"ELI5: why do things look so much farther away on my cell phone camera in comparison to my eyes?","answer":"This is common to many cameras, not just cell phone cameras.  Cameras without interchangeable lenses tend to use somewhat wide-angle lenses (and it's generally recommended you buy a wide-angle lens for your camera if it accepts interchangeable lenses).  This is a reasonable approximation of the field of view of your own eyes.  Your field of view as you look straight forward is easily 120 degrees or so; including peripheral vision, it is nearly 180 degrees.  The field of view of cell phone camera is roughly 90 degrees.  If you could bring the screen of the cell phone right up to your nose--and still be able to focus your eyes on it--the view on the screen actually would be about the same size as what you can see with your own eyes.  But in order to fit that 90 degrees or so on the screen, and because you typically need to hold the screen at least about 1.5 feet or more from your eyes to be able to focus your eyes on it, everything on the screen will look quite small."},
{"title":"ELI5: Why can american porn websites sell porn by simply asking if people are over 18, when store owners have to ask for ID.","question_detail":"Just wondering if there is a legal reason or if it's just a practicality issue.","answer":"Websites \"sell porn\" by asking for a Credit Card, that is their age verification measure. \n\nIf you are asking why you only have to click \"I am over 18\" to view a porn site, it comes down to business vs burden. \n\nFirst of all, by requiring you to click to verify you are over 18, the responsibility shifts from the website to the individual, if you are not 18 and you click it, then YOU are the one breaking the law, not the website.\n\nSecondly, it next becomes a question of \"how much burden does this place on the producer/seller vs how much it affects their business.\" For a store owner, simply asking for an ID before purchase does not place much of a burden on that store owner, nor on the individual. Whereas checking an ID online usually involves a Credit Card, which means the site needs to have a secure method to do so, and ultimately having a CC check just to VIEW their products has a negative effect on their overall business (some people would simply look elsewhere to purchase something if they were required to enter a CC just to view the products for sale). \n\n"},

Their hooves are adapted for the mountains.  They have a different structure than the goats you find on a farm.  Wild goats are born and bred for mountain life and their hooves are an excellent example with that difference.  \n\nGoats also have a great sense of balance, due to evolution.  They are able to balance their stocky bodies on less than ideal locations for the time being. \n\nBut it's not without their agility.  They will constantly be leaping to another place to try and get somewhere, like a frog across lily pads.  \n\nSource:  Former goat farmer."},
{"title":"ELI5: I'm an American who does not understand the set up of Oxford colleges.","answer":"The collegiate system as used at several British universities (not just Oxford) works roughly like the United States of America's government. Just as you have a Federal government and then individual States' governments, with collegiate universities you have the central University which manages some aspects of the university, but each College has a large degree of autonomy to manage its own affairs in the way it sees best.\n\nThis allows very small colleges to exist (a typical Oxford college will only have a few hundred undergraduate students and a similar number of postgrads) which means they can specialise in particular areas. Each college has a great deal of academic and financial freedom and so can seek independent funding, build its own labs and libraries, and so on.\n\nYet at the same time they can take advantage of being part of a much larger organisation (the University of Oxford) which means they can share resources where necessary. The University also provides a way to oversee the quality of education at each college so that no individual college can dilute the reputation of a University of Oxford degree, for example.\n\nAnother way of looking at it that might be more familiar for an American is to consider the University of California. Although each campus (e.g. Berkeley, UCLA, UCSC) is an independent and separate university, with its own revenue stream and a specific reputation, they are all part of the more general University of California. Of course this isn't an exact analogy but it might help.\n\n*Edit: typo*\n\n"},
{"title":"ELI5: Chiasmus","answer":"This is very vague, and youll see why. Chiasmus is greek for 'cross', and 'chiasmata' is the plural. That means that it has multiple definitions in todays world. If you look at literature, youll see it is a literary technique, usually pointed out in the classical languages latin and ancient greek. Thats kind of difficult to explain without an example which i cant think up off the top of my head, so its a good job that im going to take a guess and assume you mean chiasmus in a biological context. In meiosis, a process in which your DNA gets copied, split up and other things so that you can create your gametes (sex cells - sperm or eggs), there is a bit in the process that takes place before your DNA starts getting split up and shoved into new cells, where your DNA gets mixed up a bit. This is called recombination and its good because the mixing up of your DNA means that random changes can get made to it, which then get passed to your sex cells and therefore your kids. This could give them an advantage in life and allow them to reproduce more than everyone else, but probably wont. During the recombination, the bits of DNA getting mixed up - the maternal chromosome (the one from your mum) and the paternal chromosome (the one from your dad) cross over each other. imagine two x shapes with the bottom right leg of one x crossing over the bottom left leg of the other x, for example. This is why recombination is also known as crossing-over by some people. The chromosomes in this crossed over state is called a chiasmus. The chromosomes split up after theyve done this, and then carry on going through the process of meiosis, where theyll get copied, then each of the 2 versions of a chromosome get assigned to a one of the 2 new cells that the original cell splits into it, then the actual chromosomes split and each if the 2 cells split, each getting one half of a chromosome. In this way you end up with one cell containing 46 chromosomes turning into 4 cells each with 23 chromosomes, which are the gametes. Keep in mind that this is a HUGE oversimplification of meiosis but ELI5."},

{"title":"ELI5: How do cameras work?","question_detail":"Both film and digital. ","answer":"Film cameras use almost exactly the same lens and colour splitting principles as the digital camera (they were all designed in telescopes first) but instead of digital sensors they use a film made of silver compounds (I want to say silver nitrate or silver acetate, but I don't know). These coumpounds are usually colourless, but when they are exposed to light the compound reacts and usually changes colour to black. This creates an image that is the reverse of what you actually see and it is called the negative. If you took a photo of a white puppy, you get a negative of a black puppy casting a white shadow. Each molecule of the silver compound functions effectively the same as a pixel in a digital sensor, so film has a vastly improved resolution.\n\nThere's more stages where you use chemicals to stop the silver compounds from reacting with light, and then you use other chemicals to actually print the photo, but I don't deal with that part."},

What is the difference between vapor and smoke then? ","answer":"Both have the goal of converting the active substances into something you can inhale.  The higher heat of burning can destroy some of the chemicals - this means that vaporizing allows you to get the same high off of less weed.  Burning also has you inhaling burnt plant matter (smoke) which does nothing for you &amp; isn't the best for your lung health.\n\nSmoking, OTOH, is easier, cheaper &amp; more convenient.

{"title":"ELI5: Latour's Actor Network Theory","question_detail":"Hi ELI5! I'm wondering if any of you could explain Bruno Latour's Actor Network theory to me in simple terms.\nThanks in advance!","answer":"Actor-Network Theory, or ANT for short, treats objects as if they were active participants in a social network. One way of thinking about this would be your apartment. Yes you live with your two roommates and might think there were three people in your social network, or more if you include your loud neighbors. But you'd be leaving out the smoke alarm which is an active participant to your network in that it wakes the whole apartment up at 6 in the morning when Roommate #2 is making toast before work at the ER. The smoke alarm is part of your social network and its actions, or failure to work, drastically affect your social network. ANT claims the smoke detector is \"performing\", and though the range of actions available to it are limited, it's still fundamentally not too different from how other roommates act and affect the network. furthermore, when your smoke alarm fails to perform, you might not be conscious of it until that lack of performance affects the entire structure of the social network, like as in the moment when you stop thinking about your apartment as a place where you live so much as a lot of rooms full of fire. \n\nThis probably seems self-evident, but now try to imagine the microscope in a lab and how its performance or lack of performance can affect the outcomes of scientific research. Luckily I think that Latour overextends himself here and we can trust the validity of the scientific process because it repeats its experiments again and again in slightly different conditions until we get a pretty good idea what the \"crucial\" things are. Nevertheless, it's a useful reminder that simple objects can have a profound ability to speak to us in really subtle ways to the point where we might not want to draw a strong distinction between a person and a smoke alarm."},

{"title":"ELI5: how does lift work in flight? And how is it different in airplanes and helicopters?","question_detail":"Does science even lift?","answer":"Another way to think of lift is that wings (including helicopter blades) work by deflecting the air downwards slightly.

This is pretty obvious when you look at a helicopter, but if you watch an airplane take off or land on a dusty or misty day, you can see it happening there too.\n\nOf course, this doesn't really answer *how* the wing deflects air downwards, or why the curved airfoil shape is so much better than a simple angled flat plate would be.

I get to know when it is 'that day' bit I want to recognise it my myself. A bit of scientific explanation is always welcome :)","answer":"You can't really generalise it too much. Not every phase of the cycle has the same or any affects on the mood of every girl. I, for example, am only moody on the third day of menstruation. The other days I don't think it has any big effects on my mood.\n\nBut it basically works like this:\nEach menstrual cycle last 28 days on average. That can vary fairly much though.\nThe first day of the menstruation is the first day of a new cycle. The first phase is called Follicular phase. During that time the follicle (it grows the eggs) matures. During that time the lining of the uterus also grows.\n\nThe next phase is the ovulation, which happens around two weeks before the next menstruation. The follicle releases the egg and it wanders to the uterus. (This can hurt like hell by the way. Every second month I feel like I have acute appendicitis because of that.)\n\nIn the last phase the follicle develops into the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum produces hormons, which keeps the lining of the uterus thick so the fertilized egg can develop. If the egg isn't fertilized, the next menstruation comes. \n\n"},

","answer":"Win: Given to a pitcher on the team that won the game.  The winning pitcher is the one who was in the game when his team took the lead for good.  The first pitcher in the game for the winning team may only be credited with a win if he stays in the game for 5 innings.  If the starter would've gotten the win, but he didn't last a full 5 innings, then the official scorer gets to decide which other pitcher deserved the win.\n\nSave: Given to the last person to pitch for the winning team.  To get a save, the final pitcher must enter the game with his team in the lead and never give up the lead.  Additionally, one of the following 3 conditions must be met:\n\n1) The final pitcher pitched for 3 or more innings.\n\n2) The final pitcher entered the game with a lead of no more than 3 runs.\n\n3) The final pitcher entered the game in a situation where the tying run could be scored by either a runner on base, the current batter, or the batter on-deck.  \n\nPlease note that wins and saves are often-mentioned statistics for baseball pitchers, but they are not necessarily great indicators of how well a pitcher performed.  For example, there are multiple examples of pitchers who threw 9 innings without giving up a hit and not getting a win, and some pitchers have gotten saves in games where their teams won by huge margins.

{"title":"ELI5: What makes a fluorescent light flicker?","question_detail":"Why do long fluorescent lights (T8's or T12's) flicker, while incandescent or CFL bulbs stay constant?","answer":"All flourescent light bulbs flicker, both tubes and CFLs, but the flickering is often faster than people can notice. There's actually an arc of electricity formed inside of it, but it is a \"negative resistance\" device. That means that the more current that flows, the lower the electrical resistance, and that allows even more current to flow.  If you just let this go on unchecked, the bulb will quickly burn itself out.  So instead, a \"ballast\" or other circuit is used to rapidly pulse the arc on and off. \n  \nYou may notice the flickering in some more than others if the ballast makes them pulse at only 50 or 60 Hertz (cycles per second). Your CFLs may be pulsing much faster than that (such as several thousand Hz), so you simply don't perceive it at all.   \n  \nIf the flickering becomes *very* noticeable, it probably means that the bulb is nearing its end of life.

Eventually you recognize that there is a pattern and begin to have metathoughts about them (like, \"hmm, I wonder why I keep thinking about this\" or \"oh gahh i wish i could forget that\"), and the existence of those metathoughts makes it more likely that your brain will KEEP referring to those thoughts again."},

(That doesn't need to be answered, just to give an idea of what sort of differences I'm looking for). I would assume that in a big state like New York or California they would legislate differently since there are so many Representatives and only two Senators, but what's that difference? \n\nThanks. ","answer":"They do more or less the same work. The difference is prestige, visibility, and ambition.\n\nSenators are elected statewide. In the least populous states, this matters not at all, since there's only one congressman and he's elected statewide, too. In other states, Senators have to win way more votes, so it's more big-scale campaigning, while House elections still involve a lot of handshaking and baby kissing. \n\nDistricts can be gerrymandered, but states can't be -- states are mostly competitive, while nearly all the House districts are safe for one party or the other. So running for Senate is even more about money and charisma, while running for House can be more about connections in the party.\n\nSenator is a huge prestige job -- on par with Governor. Being a big-state senator is one of three jobs that you gives you a viable shot to run for President (the others are Governor and Vice-President). Every Senator is a potential candidate for his party's nomination.\n\nOnce you get to Washington, there are 5.35 times as many Senators as members in the House. That means the average Senator can command 5.35 times the media attention of an average Congressman (easily).\n\nHouse rules are set so that the Speaker basically runs the show -- controls what comes to a vote and when, who gets to make speeches and for how long, etc. In the Senate, however, it's wide open -- Senators basically have an open floor to talk about whatever they want, and make it a national issue.\n\nThe filibuster is only in the Senate. That means that each Senator has a valuable bargaining chip -- they can threaten to make it really hard to pass bills. Bills rarely pass the House by 1 vote, but they pass the Senate by 1 vote all the time. Being the last guy on the fence gives you huge power to demand favors in return."},

{"title":"ELI5: 2001: A Space Oddysey","question_detail":"I feel not smart for not understanding anything at all in that movie. I don't know how anything connects, I don't understand the ending, what does HAL have to do with the monoliths, I just don't get it.","answer":"The movie is broken up into four parts: prehistory, two periods of current history, and one at at an indeterminate time (probably the present or near-future). In the first three time periods, the version of human beings discover a giant black shape - the Monolith. The Monolith is a device left for us by an unknown highly-advanced race of beings. Our discovery of it in each time period sends out a beacon to that race, telling it that we have reached a certain point in our evolution and are ready to move on to the next.\n\nIn prehistory, the Monolith actively teaches the apes how to use their limbs with more coordination, and how to make tools. That the apes immediately apply that knowledge to making weapons is social commentary by Clarke and Kubrick, but not strictly relevant to the plot. \n\nIn the first part of the present-day, we are exploring the Moon and discover a second Monolith buried. By discovering it, we show the advanced race that we are beginning to explore outside of our own planet. The whine heard on the Moon is a message from the Monolith to the advanced race to prepare the next step - the Jupiter Monolith. \n\nA few years later, we make our way out to the Jupiter Monolith. This tells the alien race that we have begun exploring deep into our Solar System, and are ready for the next stage - the Star Child. \n\nAfter HAL goes crazy and kills the crew (for reasons which are spelled out in the sequel, 2010, but which I can detail here separately from this explanation if you like), Dave is all alone and decides to go exploring the Monolith, since that is the reason they came all that way. It's possible the Monolith is telepathically urging him to come to it, but this is never spelled out, and is just speculation to explain why he does what he does. When he goes to the Monolith, it becomes what most people call a Stargate, and draws him into it. Inside (and this part is taken from the commentary with Kier Dullea, who played Dave), the alien race probes Dave's mind and constructs a world in his head that is familiar to him while they modify his being into his new form. He grows older and older, and eventually transforms into something entirely new, the Star Child. \n\nThe Star Child is our next stage of evolution, guided by this advanced race. Interestingly, the race guiding this process seems to only care about technological advances, not social ones - their benchmarks for each stage are based on technological accomplishments, not whether we've achieved world peace or conquered our violent impulses. I'm not entirely sure what the thesis is there, but it's something I always think about when I watch the film, and I'm curious to see what others think.\n\n[EDIT]: you asked three main questions, I answered two. The third is 'what does HAL have to do with the monoliths[?]' The answer is: nothing. He is built by man, programmed by man, and serves man. He never communicates with the Monolith(s), nor do they communicate with him. HAL has information about the Monolith around Jupiter that he is instructed to withhold from his crew (that's the tape recording that pops up as Dave is deactivating him). His murder of the crew is in no way caused or influenced by the Monoliths, and is entirely the product of faulty and conflicting programming by humans. Here is a transcript from the scene in 2010 where the cause of HAL's malfunction is laid out (Dr. Chandra is one of the scientists who designed HAL):\n\n*******\nDr. Heywood Floyd: Wait... do you know why HAL did what he did?\n\nChandra: Yes. It wasn't his fault.\n\nDr. Heywood Floyd: Whose fault was it?\n\nChandra: Yours.\n\nDr. Heywood Floyd: Mine?\n\nChandra: Yours. In going through HAL's memory banks, I discovered his original orders. You wrote those orders. Discovery's mission to Jupiter was already in the advanced planning stages when the first small Monolith was found on the Moon, and sent its signal towards Jupiter. By direct presidential order, the existence of that Monolith was kept secret.\n\nDr. Heywood Floyd: So?\n\nChandra: So, as the function of the command crew - Bowman and Poole - was to get Discovery to its destination, it was decided that they should not be informed. The investigative team was trained separately, and placed in hibernation before the voyage began. Since HAL was capable of operating Discovery without human assistance, it was decided that he should be programmed to complete the mission autonomously in the event the crew was incapacitated or killed. He was given full knowledge of the true objective... and instructed not to reveal anything to Bowman or Poole. He was instructed to lie.\n\nDr. Heywood Floyd: What are you talking about? I didn't authorize anyone to tell HAL about the Monolith!\n\nChandra: Directive is NSC 342/23, top secret, January 30, 2001.\n\nDr. Heywood Floyd: NSC... National Security Council, the White House.\n\nChandra: I don't care who it is. The situation was in conflict with the basic purpose of HAL's design: The accurate processing of information without distortion or concealment. He became trapped. The technical term is an H. Moebius loop, which can happen in advanced computers with autonomous goal-seeking programs.\n\nWalter Curnow: The goddamn White House.\n\nDr. Heywood Floyd: I don't believe it.\n\nChandra: HAL was told to lie... by people who find it easy to lie. HAL doesn't know how, so he couldn't function. He became paranoid.\n*******\n\nIn the sequel, HAL is used as a conduit to relay a message from Dave Bowman (on behalf of the advanced race), but he serves basically the same function as a cellphone - to relay the message, nothing more.\n\nIf you have any further questions, I'll be happy to answer them.\n\nTL;DR: 2001 is about a race of aliens helping us evolve."},

{"title":"ELI5: How does a Dutch Auction work in terms of an IPO?","question_detail":"We did a simulation in class tonight and I STILL don't understand it.  The Wikipedia article didn't pertain to IPOs so I'm still at a loss. ","answer":"First, the objective of the owners of a business looking to IPO is to raise the most money possible, for the number of shares they are looking to issue.  They don't know what investors are prepared to pay, so they ask them enter bids for the number of shares they want to buy plus the price they will buy them at.  An individual investor might say, \"we'll, I like this company, but of course hoe much I like it depends on the price.  If the price was 100 I might make a small investment of 1000 and buy 10 shares.  If the price was 80, I would make a medium investment of 8000 and buy 100 shares.  If the price were 60, I would think that was such a great deal that I would invest everything I have got which is 60000 and buy 1000 shares.  Now, the IPOing company wants to sell 10,000 shares and raise the most money it can, so it says to investors, OK, give us bids for how many shares you will buy at different prices we will sell 10,000 shares to the highest bids, but don't worry about getting ripped off and paying more than others for your shares.  We will give the high bids all the shares they asked for, and only charge what the last of the 10,000 shares was bid at for all of them.  This method is designed to give the company the highest price per share at which all of the shares can be sold."},

{"title":"ELI5: The difference between decriminalizing and legalizing","answer":"I'm a lawyer in a common law jurisdiction. I'll see if I can make it as simple as possible.\n\nLegalisation, as most of the posters have observed, means that subject to legislative regulation, the conduct of an act may be undertaken free of interference by government. The government will often still retain a right to regulate behavior which is legal, but it will be dependent upon what powers that government has in its constitution to make laws.\n\nFor example, it is legal within your state to drive a car, but your government will regulate the age at which you are allowed to do so, the level of alcohol which may be present in your blood while you're doing it, and possibly between which hours of the day you're allowed to drive. Failure to abide by these regulations may be criminal behaviour.\n\nCriminal law, as distinct from civil law (not to be confused with a civil law jurisdiction, being countries which derive their law from the Roman tradition) is generally speaking the law which, if broken, will see the imposition of a sanction by the State. In some instances, the same physical action may result in criminal and civil proceedings being undertaken against you in a Court. For example, let's say that Mike is at a party and punches Rob in head and breaks three of Rob's teeth. The police may lay charges against Mike for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and he may be tried by a jury and convicted, whereupon he will be sentenced by a judge and (possibly)  be sent to gaol, be placed on a good behaviour bond with a suspended sentence, fined, or a combination of these things. Rob may also take Mike to court and sue him in tort for compensation for the injuries he suffered. Mike would probably be obliged to pay Rob the cost of having his broken teeth fixed, as well as monetary compensation for pain and suffering.\n\nThis brings us to decriminalisation. \n\nThe criminal law is a bit of a blunt instrument in the manner it deals with social problems. In theory, sentencing someone is supposed to focus on punishing them for their wrongdoing; deterring them (and others) from performing a similar criminal act (this is called specific and general deterrence respectively); and finally rehabilitating the person who committed the crime.\n\nIn our example of Mike and Rob, Mike may serve time in a prison (the imposition of that aspect of the sentence meeting the first two requirements for sentencing) and may also be required to undergo counselling (at his own expense) or undertake some form of anger management program, with a view to rehabilitating him and making him a more functional member of society, less likely to re-offend, upon his release.\n\nSome might argue that Mike deserves what he gets, because of the positive nature of his act and the direct impact it had upon Rob, which was not insignificant. Assault occasioning actual bodily harm is probably not a good crime to 'decriminalise'.\n\nBut what about the so called 'victimless crimes'? People in these instances are usually referring to things like prostitution and drug offences, the harm of which is not always felt as obviously as by Rob getting punched in the head. Who really gets hurt if you've got a couple of grams of marijuana on you?\n\nThe move towards decriminalisation of drugs, as an example, is usually a balancing act between the illegality of the act and the relative cost in enforcement of those laws (both by police and the judiciary). Realising that a trial before a judge, even as a summary offence (or an 'infraction' if you're in the USA), is going to cost a lot of time and money to see you arrested, the evidence gathered, a police prosecutor briefed, the matter heard, sentence given and then carried out.\n\nInstead, the focus is on deterrence and minor punishment, usually at first instance. The punishment may be in the form of referral to a treatment program in the case of drug possession (the idea being that a person who has drugs may be addicted, and it is in the better interests of society to have them get clean than lock them in gaol without treatment, likely to remain addicted or become addicted upon release) or a fine. It is even possible that the person may not have a criminal conviction recorded against them, but only if they complete the program. \n\nThe kicker, however, is that this kind of treatment is usually for a first offence only. If you're caught a second time, the kid gloves come off.\n\nThe overall aim of such a program of decriminalisation is to:\n- Reduce the cost of administering justice;\n- Provide greater rehabilitative prospects to the accused and not limit future potential by recording a criminal conviction; and\n- Deter the person from future conduct (by scaring the crap out of them - the criminal justice system isn't exactly pleasant).\n\n"},

When they did, the colors on the monitor would be distorted, because the stray magnetism was causing the electron beam to hit the wrong colors of phosphors on the screen. To de-gauss a monitor in the usual way, you would press a button on the monitor and random, gradually weakening pulses of electricity would be sent to several coils around the edge of the screen.  This would re-randomize the magnetism of the monitor's screen.\n\nWhere I worked, we happened to have a powerful permanent magnet scavenged from some piece of equipment.  The desk this computer was at was steel, so we were using the magnet as a paperweight.  The monitor needed degaussing, but it was one of those cheapo ones *without* the de-gaussing function.

You don't know which color it is until you see it, so you hypothesize that the ball, as far as you know, is both red *and* blue while you're not looking at it, and it might somehow sense you looking at it and change just before you know what color it is.\n\nSchrodinger's Cat is similar to the HUP, except instead of using balls and colors like I did in my explanation, it uses a cat and whether or not it's alive. Pretty much, put a cat in a box with something that may or may not kill it, and until you open the box and see the cat, you have no idea if it's alive or dead, so it may as well be both.  \nTechnically both the Cat and my ball analogy are inaccurate because quantum particles don't break physics by being two things at once like a cat or a ball would.\n\nTL;DR Schrodinger's Cat is ELI5 Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle before ELI5 was a thing."},

Aluminum alloy 1000 Series, 2000 Series, etc.)?\n\nWhat alloys are used for what?\n\nWhat's the \"rarest\" alloy?","answer":"Regarding categorical naming: I don't know about aluminum alloys, but I do know about steels.  And let me tell you, EVERYONE has a different naming system.  Most of them are \"national\" standards - so there's one that the Germans use, another that the Americans use, another that the Chinese use, etc.  We have big equivalency tables that help if you're trying to buy similar steels overseas or something, but they're not *exactly* the same - a slightly larger percentage of element x, smaller percentage of element y, etc.  Oftentimes, though, small changes in the chemistry won't affect the mechanical properties too much.\n\nSo generally when ordering steel, you submit a *material specification*, which is a 1 or 2-page document that outlines exactly what you're looking for.  There's way too much information to be encompassed in just a quick \"1000 series\"-type number.  You can specify max-min percentage values on 7-12 different alloying elements (chromium, nickel, manganese, etc.), required strength values, toughness values, hardness values, and much more.  \n\nSo you show the material spec you need to the steelmaker, and in return they will provide a *material certificate*.  That's like the specification, but instead of required max/min values, it shows the actual tested values (chemistry, mechanical properties, whatever) of the steel he wants to sell you.  If the certificate meets the required values of the specification, you buy."},

{"title":"How exactly did The Beatles revolutionize modern music?","answer":"When they first became extremely popular (around 1963) their music was an unusual mix of different musical influences. They had good harmony, often had unusual syncopation, and had a songwriting team that had a way of coming up with very catchy melodies and hooks. Girls also thought that at least a couple of them were extremely cute, they had a hairdo that by the standards of the time was radical, Lennon in particular was very quotable, and McCartney was extremely likeable. These factors combined to ignite \"Beatlemania\". The record company and DJs loved to hype them up, and many adults loved to make fun of the way they looked. It was a kind of perfect storm that made them the most popular band in the world among teenagers.  \n  \nIf that was all there was to them, they would have gone down in musical history as a very popular band, but that's about it. But the Beatles' music evolved very significantly. With the help of a great record producer (George Martin) they first started incorporating classical instruments into their songs. This wasn't highly unusual at the time, but was something that was mostly done in more traditional ballads, not upbeat pop songs, and not carrying major melodic themes (usually). And then they started to experiment with other sounds. They would incorporate \"non-musical\" sounds into their songs, and play around with things like backwards masking and unusual instruments like the sitar. This kind of musical experimentation showed up quite a bit on \"Revolver\", but then reached a head on \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\".  \n  \nSgt. Pepper's cemented the Beatles' place in musical history. Even though there is only one real standout song on the album (\"A Day in the Life\"), the overall sound of the album ignited a revolution in popular music. (For example, the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson heard it and became musically paralyzed, saying there was no way that they could do anything that would compare.) It is difficult to appreciate how different that album sounded today, since so many bands have been influenced by what they did. But at the time, it was as if someone added a new dimension to sound. The Beatles had invented \"psychedelic\" music. Sgt. Pepper's was also one of the first rock albums made to be listened to as an entire album rather than just a collection of songs.  \n\nIt was as if the Beatles had first invented musical algebra in the Beatlemania era, and then went on and invented musical calculus with Sgt. Pepper's."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why/How do people like Hitler raise to dominate power?","answer":"Hitler was not elected into power by a democratic vote in quite the way that some people make it seem.  The German state was going through a crisis, a crisis of itself, and revolution was in the air.  After no strong majority was formed in the parliament, a couple of businessmen urged Hindenburg, the president of the State at the time, to appoint Hitler as leader of the government.  After this was the Reichstag fire which was blamed on communists, so the communist party was suppressed and basic rights of citizens were suspended and detention without trial was enabled.  Then came the March elections where the nazis through their increased presence in the state apparatus, intimdated people with paramilitary activity.  This still didn't give the nazis a majority vote, and the nazis were always a fringe party at the best of times, so they had to again join up with another party to form a majority.\n\nAfter they got the majority, Hitler tried to pass the enabling act (the one that would let him act as dictator basically), but he needed a two thirds majority.  He had already had the communists banned and then used the Reichstag Fire Decree to ban the social democrats, who were one of the biggest parties and the one that was most consistently voted for by the working clas.  So with the opposition removed and the rest of the parliamentary members being intimidated by the SA, Hitler had the enabling act passed and then lead to the creation of the dictatorship.  This pattern of intimidation continued until other parties were forced to disband and the social-democrats were made illegal and their assest siezed.  So it's not like Hitler just ran an election and was voted in all fair and square, and it was not like his speeches and charisma got him into power either.\n\nThe reason why people like Hitler come to power is to prop up the state in face of growing capitalist crisis.  Fascism is really a reaction towards working class agitation, and it's pretty clear that this was the case with Hitler and the history of his build up to power and then the later actions of the state.  If it wasn't Hitler, then it would have been someone else stepping into his shoes because the capitalist class needed a strong man to represent their interests and to put a stop to working class agitation.  \n\nEDIT: [fixed it up a bit, added some more stuff](http://www.united-academics.org/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/germansgroot.jpg)"},

This is how many times an individual battery can be charged and discharged.  the \"life\" of the battery, no matter how often you charge it, or leave it plugged in, does not shorten, unless you charge/discharge frequently.\n\nThe biggest \"killer\" of the Li- battery, is inactivity.  The batteries like to be charged and discharged on a regular basis.  If you keep a device with a Li- Battery plugged in for a long period of time (weeks or months), it slowly discharges, until the device needs to charge it up again.  the problem is, every time the charge drops to that limit, it begins a new charge cycle... this decreases the length of the battery.\n\nTo break it down better:\n\nIf the charge cycle is triggered, when the battery hits 99% instead of 100%.... it will waste an entire \"cycle\" for 1%.  if it takes a day for it to drop 1% while plugged in, and your battery only has 200 cycles....  your battery will die in less than a year.\n\nOn the other hand, if you regularly unplug your device and use it until it drops to 5-10%, and then charge it up, you might be able to stretch that 200 cycles over a period of 2-3 years, since it's not \"wasting\" charge cycles to keep the battery \"topped off\".\n\nAlso, Plugging a device in, removing the charger 20 min later halfway charged, and then plugging it in again.... that wastes cycles!."},

I know I could probably google this for myself, but, I want to know in what ways does knowing about my metabolism help me when weight watching, for example?","answer":"Metabolism is the combination of breaking down things for energy, and using energy to make them. Fats for example; when you eat them, your body breaks it down into the smallest bits it can, and in the process, usable energy is created. If you have a bunch of those small bits floating around, and you don't NEED energy, you will assemble those bits INTO fat and store them in case you need energy at some point.\n\nA \"fast\" metabolism doesn't necessarily reference a speed, but more so it is referring to the fact that a person's system is more favorable to breaking down fats, carbs, etc. as opposed to storing them. The reason why is ultimately the body determines that the person needs more energy than someone with a \"slow\" metabolism, but the causes for the body determining that are many. People with lots of muscle need more energy even when they aren't working out, and people with cancer need more energy to fight off the cancer. There are too many reasons to mention."},

{"title":"ELI5: What is your credit score and how is it calculated?","answer":"What you're asking isn't strictly public info.\n\nIn the US, there are three credit bureaus that track credit, and each one assigns you a different score: TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax. Each of these has permission from the government to track certain information about you, and in exchange for that, they have to do certain things (allow you to get a free annual credit check, for instance).\n\nThe way these scores are calculated is to do with how responsible you are with credit, but there is also a component to do with how profitable you are to credit companies. If you religiously pay off your balance every month or avoid credit completely, you will have a lower score than if you revolve a small amount of debt at interest.\n\nThings you can do to increase your credit score:\n\n* Always pay all your bills on time (obvious).\n* If you miss a payment or discover a debt, be proactive about resolving it directly with the creditor. If that debt has been reported to the credit bureau, you are allowed to file a letter explaining your side of the situation and that is taken into account when your credit is evaluated. (Of course it depends what the letter says, if there is a truly extenuating circumstance, ok, if you say, I forgot, then the fact that you filed it is good but the content doesn't really do anything but confirm that you were irresponsible.)\n* If you do run into a situation where your credit is dinged in a big way, it can be a good idea to get legal help to resolve it. Often people do things that make their situation worse because they don't understand how the system works or they want to deny the whole thing and try to make it go away. This does not work.\n* Keep a reasonable amount of credit for your income. The total credit line you have across all of your credit cards, for instance, should not exceed ~50% of your annual income. (This is the amount you could borrow, not the amount you actually have borrowed.)\n* Have a relationship with each major network: Amex, Visa, Mastercard. It's best to get one card with each, because then you can be choosy, get the lowest rate possible, no annual fee, and whatever other benefits they offer to try to attract you. You can often get cash back rewards between 1-5%, frequent flier miles, and travel insurance (usually for a fee, but sometimes worth it). Make the issuing banks compete for your business.\n\nIf you do these things and pay off your balance each month, you'll be golden. Some people want to build up their credit as fast as possible, if that's the case, then:\n\n* Revolve a small amount of debt on your cheapest card, ~2-5% of your annual income for some months, then pay it off completely and be debt-free for a month or two, then repeat.\n* Never make minimum payments. Make your monthly payments at least 2x the minimum.\n\nThis costs a bit of money, but it does increase your score faster than any other way. The credit bureaus argue this is because it demonstrates that you can engage the system and use credit wisely and responsibly instead of just avoiding it altogether, but most would say it's because the industry pressures them to reward people that create a profit.\n\nIt pays (literally) to understand a bit about money.

{"title":"ELI5: Supply and Demand","question_detail":"I understand the microeconomic principles of supply and demand..ie supply curve is upward sloping and demand curve is downward sloping. So as price falls demand increases, etc. What I don't understand is that these principles don't hold true in the stock market. When demand is high (many buyers and few sellers) price skyrockets. This seems to go against the principle of downward sloping demand. What am I missing here?","answer":"You're missing one key about supply and demand. While it's true that demand can increase when the price falls...it's also true that a limited supply can cause the price to increase as the perceived value of the product increases. Look at the price of precious metals, the amount of money people can demand for things like concert tickets when they're sold out, even re-selling electronics on eBay when demand is high and the supply is limited."},

{"title":"ELI5: How do insects function brain wise, they're so small. How do they know how to do anything.","question_detail":"Was sitting outside, and this lil' bug was wandering past my hand, and it just got me thinking how does it know how to walk/fly, what to eat, where to go. If I moved my hand close it moved away, it released something had moved/arrived and decided to avoid it. \n\nThis thing was tiny it wasn't an ant, it was one of those super tiny things, and really got me wondering how does it have all this information in what is smaller than a pin head of a body.\n\nThis is for all insects really, just this really tiny fella got me thinking.\n","answer":"Basically, humans and all of our thinking is way beyond the capabilities of insects, or most other animals for that matter. Yes, insect brains are itty bity teeny tiny compared to ours, but they're still incredibly complex, just as ours are. A network of only 30 neurons (our brains have an estimated 100 billion) is too complicated to fully understand, so you really don't need that much \"computation power\" to do things.  \n  \nSo, much of what insects do is reactionary, and doesn't necessarily take place in the brain. For example, flies don't ever \"learn\" to fly as humans learn to walk, they just have a network of muscle neurons that just *do* it. Basically, one muscle pulls on another, so when one contracts it forces the other to contract immediately, and vice versa, hence flying. This is obviously very different from learning the muscle coordination and balance required for most mammals to begin hopping around like we do.  \n  \nAs far as \"avoiding obstacles,\" or \"navigating towards goals,\" again, much of what they do is reactionary. Humans add a lot of complex thoughts to very basic behaviors; if we want to eat something, we go up to it, smell it, decide if it will taste good, think about how many calories it has, maybe decide if we ate it we'd have to work out later to justify it, maybe think we should save it later for when Bob comes over, etc... Most animals just friggin' go for it. Omnomnom that rotten fruit, aww yea. So they don't \"know\" the 'why' they want to eat something like we do, they just \"know\" to eat it (in a similar way we \"know\" to breath). As far as the mechanics of it, it doesn't actually take that much brain power to recognize pheromones of your fellow colony members or feel (or taste) that whatever you're walking on isn't what you're used to and you should gtfo of there. If you think of a very simple \"good/bad\" function, that simplifies it quite a bit. Insects have also been shown to process things in a very linear fashion. That is to say, their behavior can be exactly predicted by the given stimuli. What that means is their behavior only factors in a very limited number of inputs, such as light/dark of their surroundings, presence/absence of specific scents, and similar simple things like that which we aren't even aware of perceiving most of the time. \n  \nTL;DR: They don't \"know\" how to do anything. They just do it. "},
{"title":"ELI5: What does the idea \"survival of the fittest\" mean in regards to evolution?","question_detail":"I'm a Christian honestly trying to understand evolution. I expect that fact to result in downvotes and whatever but for those who are willing to indulge me, I'm mostly wanting to know if I'm understanding this correctly. \n\nThe general idea I have grasped is that as an organism (species? please correct my terminology if I'm using it incorrectly) \"evolves\" (mutates?) it develops different characteristics or mechanisms or whatever that give it a little different odds at survival in its given environment, and in each generation, the ones with mutations that allow it to adapt and survive will continue for future generations and those mutations will stick around, whereas the ones with mutations that pose a hindrance to survival will inevitable die off etc.\n\nI expect that i'm not quite understanding this right, so I'm looking for some good information: What does \"survival of the fittest\" mean?\n\nI'm aware that to some of you, askreddit, or even askscience might be a better place for this question, but I posted a question to askscience earlier and it never showed up in the \"new\" section. I'm also looking for an answer as would be explained to someone who really just doesn't get it, doesn't know terminology, and I'm not looking for an answer that will go over my head. So I chose to post it here. I have done some googling, a lot of the information is over my head. I'm not an unintelligent man, I just lack understanding on the subject. \n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for your responses. Good to know that I wasn't far off base, but your examples were fantastic.","answer":"&gt;I expect that i'm not quite understanding this right, so I'm looking for some \n&gt;good information: What does \"survival of the fittest\" mean?\n\nThat's a loaded phrase that is far more often abused than used correctly (like to justify the notion that rich people are inherently superior). The term preferred by science is \"natural selection.\"\n\nEvolution consists of two natural actions: random mutation, and natural selection. It's the natural selection part that does the real heavy lifting in evolution, and so it's frequently ignored by those pushing some ideology, who instead focus on silly \"random chance\" arguments.\n\nYou have the basic concept right, if some random trait gives an organism a little better chance at living, eating, and reproducing, then that random trait is more likely to be passed on and spread throughout the population.\n\nConsider some species of fish in a freshwater lake. Now, most fish have some narrow band of water salinity they can tolerate (some species more or less than others). Random mutation in those fish is happening all the time. So what happens if one fish is born with a slightly higher tolerance to saltier water? Well, as long as the water it's living in hasn't changed, nothing. That would be a neutral mutation, neither good nor bad (the vast majority of mutations are neutral). That trait might get passed on, or it might not. But what if a fish is born with a salinity tolerance such that the water it's living in is near the bottom edge of the range (that is, he prefers slightly saltier water than he's living in)? Well, that fish will likely be sickly, might not survive to adulthood, probably won't reproduce. That's a negative mutation (for those circumstances), and the trait will probably not be passed on.\n\nBut things start getting interesting if the local environment changes. Let's say that slow geological changes start making the lake more salty (and I mean over hundreds, thousands of years). NOW what happens to a fish born with a tolerance more towards salt water? Suddenly, he's the boss. He's healthier than the fish who prefer fresher water, and more likely to pass on his saltwater genes. If this continues to happen gradually over many generations, then some day, you have a salt water lake full of salt water fish. \n\nNow go back to the start of this story, and assume that there were TWO lakes connected by a river, full of the same species of freshwater fish. Then imagine that the connection river got cut off by geological activity, and the formerly-downstream lake is the one turning salty. Fast-forward many years, and now you've got two species of fish, one of which evolved from the other. There was no evolutionary pressure on the upstream fish to turn into saltwater fish, so they didn't. There is no absolute \"fittest\" in this scenario, there are only organisms better suited for their local conditions.\n\nAnd that's natural selection in a nutshell. It is by no means a *directed* process, it just means that an organism best suited to the local environment *as it is now* is probably going to do better than one that is less-suited. But over very long time scales, that can result in radical changes in body shape, diet, environmental preference, all that sort of thing.\n\nIt should be noted that both random mutation and natural selection are *actual, observed facts,* not \"just a theory\" (another abused phrase). Given that both these things are known to happen, you'd be really hard-pressed to explain how evolution WOULDN'T happen.\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: How to balance chemistry equations and why it works","answer":"The idea behind balancing an equation is that atoms don't disappear in a chemical reaction.  They may bond to other atoms, but the same number of each atom will always be on both sides of the equation.  For example\n\n&gt;Fe + Cl_2 = FeCl_3  (the underscore is a subscript)\n\nThis equation is not balanced because there are are 2 atoms of Cl on the left side and 3 atoms of Cl on the right side.  In order to balance the equation we need to have the same number of Cl and Fe atoms on both sides.  In order to do this, we add coefficients (leading numbers) to the front of each atom or group of atoms. In order to find the number of CL that we will need on both sides to balance the equation, we find the least common multiple of the number of Cls.  Since there are 2 Cl atoms on the left and 3 on the right, we find the least common multiple of 2 and 3, which is 6.  So we know that there needs to be 6 Cl atoms on both sides.  We achieve this using coefficients.  So we get:\n\n&gt;Fe + 3Cl_2 = 2FeCl_3\n\nNow the problem is that we have 2 Fe atoms on the right and only 1 on the left.  So we find the least common multiple of 2 and 1, which is 2.  So there will be 2 Fe atoms on both sides of our balanced equation.  Again, we add coefficients\n\n&gt;2Fe + 3Cl_2 = 2FeCl_3\n\nNow our equation is balanced because there is an equal number of each atom on both sides.  The same process works for any equation.\n\nEdit:  Replaced molecules with atoms.  My bad.  Math major here."},
{"title":"ELI5: Why are there child labor laws? What exactly do they accomplish?","answer":"They are in place to prevent the exploitation of mainly school age children by those who would engage them in activities that harm them or interfere with their natural development. These laws were introduced in reaction to the commonplace use of children as young as three or four years of age in mills, mines, factories, on farms - performing tasks that were dangerous to life and limb.\n\nForced to labor in extremely unhealthful conditions while exposed to industrial machinery, for up to 14 hours a day six days a week, children contracted black lung disease, lost body parts, and routinely died performing risky duties. Those who escaped immediate bodily harm were prevented from enjoying their childhood, deprived of an education, and doomed to a life of backbreaking labor.\n\nThe laws are most effective in advanced, democratic societies in which they are accompanied by progressive laws which guarantee universal access to free public education up to the age of 16. In these enlightened circumstances children are off limits to would-be employers unless special arrangements are provided for their health, education, welfare - such as the tutoring and childcare (kid wrangling) that are mandatory for school age actors, singers, etc.\n\nThe results are seen in the near elimination of labor related injuries and illness among school age children within \"first world\" countries, although child labor remains a not uncommon, serious threat to the health and happiness of kids in many developing parts of the world.\n\nThe following linked articles provide lots of detail, particularly some history of child labor:\n\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaker_boy\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_labour"},
{"title":"ELI5: How does fusion power work?","question_detail":"Some of you are probably laughing, mainly because it's impossible to explain fusion energy to a 5 year old. ;) But nuclear and fusion energies are intriguing to me, and I'd love to understand how they work, or the basics at least. I know enough about nuclear, so an explanation of fusion would be dandy. If you want to do both, go for it! I'd love to read it. Thanks!","answer":"I'm gonna assume you are a very smart five year old.\n\nE=MC^2 means energy in joules equals mass in kilograms (at rest) times the speed of light squared. This means you can write the mass of any object in units of energy.\n\nThe largest nuclear weapon ever tested unleashed 2.1*10^17 joules, 50 megatons, or about five pounds of raw energy mostly using fusion which we will get to in a second.\n\nAn individual a hydrogen atom \"weighs\" (weight is not mass but that's how people talk) 1.5*10^-10 joules or 938.8 mega electron-volts.\n\nThe rest mass of helium is, oh, 3,728 MeV. You make helium by combining the centers of four hydrogen atoms under immense heat and pressure. 4 times 938.8 MeV would be 3755 MeV. Notice the difference there. Mass is proportional to energy.\n\nHydrogen nuclei don't want to be near eachother because they both have a positive electrical charge and like charges repel, but once they are very close together and changed around a bit there is another very strong force called the \"strong force\" (physicists are not always creative at naming things) that will hold them together very tightly in a lower energy state.\n\nSo, if we want lots of energy we can try squeezing hydrogen nuclei together. This is hard. You can't squeeze them together with your fingers. A hydrogen bomb squeezes hydrogens together using another, smaller fission-based nuclear bomb or a few bombs working together.\n\nPeople who are trying to use fusion for power squeeze them together with rooms full of really big lasers or giant doughnut-shaped hollow magnets. This sort of works, but not really. It doesn't make more electricity than it takes to run the lasers and stuff, at least not yet but it is getting better all the time."},

There is no way to get the amount of bandwidth that you would expect from an internet connection wirelessly.

You should learn what each symbol/letter stands for, and why they have this relationship. \n\nFormulas didn't appear magically, some person spent months or years trying to figure it out and prove that it's true.

{"title":"ELI5: Explain how,what, and why of Square Roots","question_detail":"Really struggling on this I'm in GRADE 9 so sorta middle school guys ","answer":"**The what:** The square root of a number is the number that, when multiplied by itself equals the original number. So we say the square root of 9 is 3 because 3 × 3 = 9. Similarly the square root of 25 is 5 because 5 × 5 = 25.\n\n**The how:** Like some other operators (things like + and ×), squaring a number has its opposite. + has -. × has ÷. And ² has √. Algebra likes opposites because it makes equations easier to move things around into more understandable (i.e. reduced) forms. Unfortunately square rooting a number, like division, is hard to do without a very specific memorized set of steps (sometimes called an \"algorithm\"). With division, you learn [long division](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_division). There are similar [methods to computing square roots by hand](http://www.homeschoolmath.net/teaching/square-root-algorithm.php) but they're like advanced long division, and not terribly useful in an age of calculators. As such they're not really taught, and most books simply use small numbers with whole number square roots (like 4, 9, 25, 36, 49, etc).\n\n**The why:** Well, there are a lot of reasons. It's hard to answer \"why\" for anything in math, but the best explanation is one I've already hinted to. In algebra, we try to solve equations with some unknown number. Mostly, that involves reversing certain operations. If the unknown is multiplied by a number, we'll need to divide that number out to get the unknown number by itself. If the unknown has a number added, we'll need to subtract that number to get the unknown number by itself. Similarly, if an unknown number is squared, we'll have to square root the whole thing to cancel out the original squaring.\n\nIt's easy to get the area of a square knowing the lengths of its sides. Square roots allow us to \"go the other way\", answering the question, \"Given a square of a certain area, how long are its sides?\"\n\nFeel free to PM me for explanations of [the rules of square roots](http://www.mathwords.com/s/square_root_rules.htm) if you're not sure why they are the way they are."},

{"title":"Why do humans form greater degrees of \"love\" then other species of mammals?","answer":"I'm going to remove this, not because it's a terrible question, but because the idea of \"greater degree of love\" is humanocentric. Essentially, we judge how much two animals are in love based on standards that *we've* defined, so it doesn't really make any sense to say that, for example, two swans love each other less than two humans.\n\nBasically, it's not really a question that's possible to answer. If you're judging it by \"mating for life\" as the criteria, which I suspect, it should be noted that we do not mate for life, not by the longest stretch. Most people have a few sexual partners before marriages, and half of marriages end. "},

Same as when rain hits the pavement on a hot day or a cold morning producing the same look over a lake on a summer day.\n\nNow as far as water escaping below boiling.. as it heats some molecules will get enough kinetic energy to temporarily escape the remaining water before re-entering/falling as it cools and loses that energy.  When more molecules are able to escape than remain (evaporation) you've hit the boiling point and true steam is created.  \n\nWhat you're calling steam is water vapor that has separated and met with the cooler air which is at a condensed pressure and creates that \"cloud.\""},

{"title":"ELI5:How will Obamacare affect my business?","question_detail":"I work for a private residential substance abuse/mental health treatment facility. We are out of network with all insurances. How will Obamacare affect us?","answer":"I can explain some parts to your question.\n\n1) It imposes a penalty that is imposed on U.S. employers for hiring U.S. citizens and for hiring Legal Permit Residents. \n\nRight now, for any company with 50 or more employees, if that company does not provide a sufficiently high dollar health insurance policy for low income workers, that company faces a fine of $3,000 per worker. Moreover, that fine is not deductible on the companies taxes, which means as an effective matter to the company, the penalty is in the order of $5,000 per employee when you factor in the tax consequences. That is the present status quo under Obamacare. \n\nBasically, the illegals that are granted amnesty from the Gang of Eight bill are going to be exempt from Obamacare, so if you hiring them over U.S. citizens, you will not be penalized that $5,000 per employee. It creates an enormous incentive for hiring illegals. \n\n2) Again, this applies if you have 50 or more employees. If you do not want to face Obamacare fines, you forcibly have to reduce your workers hours. Obamacare kicks in if your workers work more than 30 hours a week.\n\nAgain, this does not apply at all if you hire immigrants who have been granted amnesty.\n\nThese two bills literally fine you for hiring U.S. citizens.\n\n"},
{"title":"Eli5: how a speaker can produce more than one note at a time?","question_detail":"Seems ridiculous. Just like to understand the physics a little better","answer":"Second comment here is pretty good in explaining this: http://www.sciforums.com/showthread.php?97540-Speakers-How-do-they-produce-different-sounds-simultaneously\n\nIt's a very good post, so I'll blatantly quote the author, mr. Fraggle Rocker, here:\n\n&gt; No no no. Your problem is not in understanding how loudspeakers work; it's in understanding how sound works.\n\n&gt; The sound you hear is the result of nerve endings in your ears reacting to the vibration of the tissue in which they reside; then converting that kinetic energy into electrical impulses; which then go to an area in your brain for decoding. It's fairly similar to your sense of touch, which is sensitivity to pressure, but it's decoded by your brain in a much different way.\n\n&gt; That tissue vibrates because the air molecules adjacent to it are vibrating. (Or water molecules, if you happen to be swimming underwater.) Your question could be just as easily restated as: \"How can a molecule produce different sounds simultaneously by vibrating at a single specific frequency at one moment in time?\"\n\n&gt; The answer is: It does not vibrate at a single frequency.\n \n&gt; It would help you understand this if you know someone who can take you into a sound studio and show you sound waves on an oscilloscope. You will see that \"sound\" is not a nice clean sine wave with an easily visible frequency and amplitude. It's an incredibly complicated waveform: the mathematical sum of all the individual sounds that are picked up by the microphone.\n\n&gt; If it's music you'll see a repeating pattern, although the shape of the wave may be so complex that the repetition might be difficult to spot. If it's conversation or ambient noise there won't be a repeating pattern, because the individual component waveforms don't have regular repeating shapes, i.e., they're not music.\n\n&gt; Consider the way you tune a guitar. (I play bass guitar but it works the same way.) You finger the E string on the fifth fret and pluck it so it produces an A, at the same time plucking the open A string. If the instrument is in tune both strings produce the identical note and you hear an A -- air vibrating at 440Hz. But if the strings are slightly out of tune, one is vibrating at (say) 440Hz while the other is at (say) 432Hz.\n\n&gt; If you capture this with a microphone and look at the waveform on an oscilloscope, you'll see a wave that is the sum of a 440Hz function and a 432Hz function. It will look somewhat like a note with the frequency of 436Hz (a slightly flat A), but with the amplitude slowly changing from one wavecrest to another. If you pan out the scale of the display so you can see several pulses at once, you'll see that the amplitude changes at a regular interval of 8Hz and the combined wave is perfectly regular, but more complicated than a single note.\n\n&gt; And the reason I use this example is that you can hear this waveform. This is how we old-timers tune our instruments. (We didn't have these newfangled digital tuners, which IMHO are useless crap anyway). If you pluck two strings simultaneously that are an A note but 8Hz out of synch, you will hear an A, but you will clearly hear the amplitude (loudness) of the note increasing and decreasing at 8Hz (8 times per second). We call those \"beats.\" Of course if the beats are much faster than 15-20 per second we can no longer discern them, and instead of hearing beats we just hear dissonance. If the strings are that far out of tune (after all, if the frequency drops to 411Hz, a mere 29Hz out of tune, it's reached the pitch of a genuine A-flat) we can hear the difference and get them closer by turning the pegs a little bit, then plucking them again and listening for the beats. Eventually we get them to the point that there are no beats and the strings are vibrating in unison, i.e., they are perfectly in tune.\n\n&gt; The molecules in the air are doing exactly the same thing the cursor on the oscilloscope is doing, which is exactly the same thing your eardrums are doing, which is exactly the same thing the microphone is doing, which is exactly the same thing the loudspeakers are doing: Adding the individual sound waves mathematically to vibrate in one single but very complicated waveform.\n\n&gt; Throughout this chain of events, from the moment two sounds are created in the same physical location all the way through the recording, playback and listening process, the molecules in the air, equipment, or your body are not \"vibrating at a single frequency.\"\n\n&gt; No precision is lost in this process. The molecules in the air, the microphone and the loudspeaker are capable of vibrating at frequencies up into the millions of Hz, easily adding sounds together and sending the aggregate waveform to your ears for your brain to deconstruct.\n\n&gt; The grooves in an old vinyl record, under a microscope, look exactly like the sound waves on the oscilloscope. Like the air, microphone, loudspeakers and eardrums, the phonograph needle is also well able to vibrate in a complicated pattern that combines multiple frequencies of sound into a single waveform--reproducing sounds up into the high frequencies and down into the bass range that you can't hear. The same is true of magnetic recording tape and radio waves.\n\n&gt; Digital recording media, of course, do not have quite this degree of precision. CDs can't match the sound quality of a brand-new vinyl LP or a 32-track studio tape, although the drop-off is very slight. For most of us the difference is--literally--inaudible, but some people, especially fans of symphonic music with its much greater loud-to-soft range than pop music, claim that they can hear it.\n\n&gt; People who listen to their music on cellphones can't possibly hear the difference and those people really don't care anyway. :)"},

{"title":"What is the internet, really?","answer":"It really is just a bunch of computers that are able to \"talk\" to each other. They generally get data from one to the other by requesting it. A asks B for something, and B sends it (as long as B has established that it is OK to send stuff like that to A).  The route the stuff takes in between A and B can vary.  \n  \nThe computers have physical locations, of course.  But when A asks B for something, it doesn't really \"know\" where B is, it just knows the address.  The computers along the route keep tables that indicate which wires to use to send things in the right general direction.  And when A's request to B arrives there, B could decide to send the request somewhere else.  A doesn't necessarily know, as long as the reply comes back through B.  \n  \nThey do all this communication via binary signals. Those signals are actually fairly complicated, much more so than binary signals inside a single computer.  A may want to send a simple request to B, but that request must also include some \"header\" information about who is requesting it, what type of request it is, how long the request is, etc.  That request coming from a single, relatively slow communications channel ends up getting broken into chunks, which are bundled together with a lot of other chunks for high-speed transmission (usually by an ISP), so some \"wrapper\" data goes around them to keep them separate and organized.  The electronic details get quite complex as faster and faster transmission standards are used, and as the signals get changed from electronic to optical (and back). "},

","answer":"You can't get rid of bacteria in the mouth because the mouth is exposed to things from outside the body, such as food, which often have at least some bacteria in them. It would be very, VERY difficult to keep your mouth completely sterile. The bacteria in your mouth feed on tiny bits of food, which are also hard to get rid of because we are taking about molecule-sized tiny bits. \n\nAlso, vaccines are for viruses, not bacteria. "},

This is the strategy of viruses like the flu.\n\n* Option 2: incorporate into the DNA of a cell, and let the cell produce virus particles over time. This is the strategy of viruses like herpes or the chicken pox. Shingles is just the chicken pox virus becoming active a second time."},

{"title":"ELI5: Steam, what is it, how does it work, why is it so great, etc.","question_detail":"I constantly see people on here post about steam and playing games on it and how great it is, and I literally have NO IDEA what it is. Please help me.","answer":"TL;DR - if you're going to even think of playing games on a computer, get Steam...it's free.  You can either buy games at STEEP discounts or just download and play one of the huge selections of Free to Play games.  \n\n----------------------------------\n\nIt's a combination of iTunes and Facebook for PC games.\n\nThe iTunes aspect is that it's a distribution method, where you go to purchase games to download and play.  You can sort by genre or publisher, buy \"packs\" of games for discounted prices, download demos before buying, and create wishlists.  You can also get pre-order deals and packages, special collector's eds, etc.  \n\nThe FB aspect is that it's (at lease becoming) a social media style program.  You can have \"friends\" that you can message and play with, view forums in a community where you can have discussions and ask questions, and create a \"profile\" where you can gather achievements, showcase trophies, and do whatever with.  You can ignore a lot of the social media aspect if you want to because, personally, I don't really care about profiles and such.\n\nWhat makes it great is a few things, the first being that it has the BEST sales in the business.  [Just go look over there right now](http://store.steampowered.com/).  50-90% off AAA titles, some of them being less than a year old.  They do massive sales like this around the holidays (summer, t-giving, xmas, easter) and then they have weekend deals, weekday deals, publisher sales, and just general sale sales scattered all over the place.  You are hard pressed to find a AAA game that doesn't go on sale at least once at year for at least 50% off.  It also has a HUGE section of completely FREE to play games that are just free, all the time.\n\nThe next best thing is the friends and multiplayer aspect.  You have your own friends (people that are actually your friends that you'd play and talk with in real life) that you can easily see if they are online, what they're playing, if they are AFK or whatever.  And then it's really easy to start up a game and either join them or invite them to play.  You can also text and voice chat through Steam.  \n\nIf you're not playing with people you know Steam still makes it pretty easy to play games online with the in-game matchmaking and may or may not use Steam servers.  Which is nice because older games are hard to get matchmaking even with friends online and Steam just hosts their own server for the game if the publisher drops support.\n\nLastly, you can have games installed to *multiple* computers.  Meaning that you can own a laptop and desktop at school, then a desktop at home and download/install your games that you buy to as many computers as you want and just log in to play.  You can also play offline if you don't have an internet connection (and kind of cheat the system by opening Steam offline on multiple computers who logged in under the same account and play over LAN).  It also manages the game installs such that it auto-updates everything fairly seamlessly.  Certain games also have very active modding communities that is all managed through Steam, so instead of having to hunt and peck for mods online through different sources it's all aggregated into one location (Steam) and can be rated and commented by the community and *kept updated* accordingly.

{"title":"ELI5: The American electoral system","question_detail":"Living in Canada, there are many things I don't understand about American politics. First, how come a state can be \"red\" or \"blue\" but have a governor from the opposite party? For example, Massachusetts is heavily democratic, yet Mitt Romney was their governor, how did that happen?\n\nI also don't understand the \"electoral college\" part either. or how come in the 2000 elections, although Al Gore won the popular vote, it depended solely on Florida who was elected president? Also, this might be a stupid question but what's the difference between the GOP and the Tea Party? is it just the same party but some members identify themselves more on the right than others?","answer":"&gt; First, how come a state can be \"red\" or \"blue\" but have a governor from the opposite party? For example, Massachusetts is heavily democratic, yet Mitt Romney was their governor, how did that happen?\n\nA Republican in Massachusetts is not the same as a Republican from Texas. State level parties adapt their tickets and policies to conditions within their states. American political parties are very de-centralized in nature so something that may be supported nationally by the party may be a no-go in an individual state. This de-centralization allows candidates to campaign with or against their larger parties positions. For instance a Democratic Governor in a \"Red\" state could champion how different his policies are from Barack Obama's. \n\n&gt; I also don't understand the \"electoral college\" part either. or how come in the 2000 elections, although Al Gore won the popular vote, it depended solely on Florida who was elected president?\n\nThat's because US elections are not decided by majority vote. The popular vote, though a good measure to gauge support, is effectively meaningless. The Electoral College actually votes for the President. \n\nUnder the federal system of the US the states themselves are choosing the President and the electoral college is how they officially cast their vote. Each state is given a of electors based on their population at the time of the last census. Electors almost now always vote for whatever candidate which wins their state but nothing prevents them from casting their own vote federally, though many states have implemented their own laws barring such acts. \n\nIn order to win the Presidency you need to get to 270 electoral votes. Since states have different population levels they have differing amount of electoral votes meaning that winning those states are more important than other states. A swing-state (could go GOP or Dem) like Florida with 29 electors can decide an election in favor of who wins it which is exactly what happened in 2000. \n\n&gt; Also, this might be a stupid question but what's the difference between the GOP and the Tea Party? is it just the same party but some members identify themselves more on the right than others?\n\nThey are a sub-group/splinter movement of the GOP. The Tea-Party is loosely organized and many groups operating under that banner can differ pretty widely. \n\n\n\n"},
{"title":"ELI5: Currency Exchanges past and present","question_detail":"I came upon this quote in a book on economics (written in 1946):\n\n\"By buying English sweaters they [Americans] furnish the English with dollars to buy American goods here. This, in fact (if I may here disregard such complications as multilateral exchange, loans, credits, gold movements, etc. which do not alter the end result) is the only way in which the British can eventually make use of these dollars. Because we have permitted the British to sell more to\nus, they are now able to buy more from us. They are, in fact, eventually *forced* to buy more from us if their dollar balances are not to remain perpetually unused.\"\n\nThis makes exactly ZERO sense to me. What I am picking up from this is that back in 1950, there was no way to exchange one currency for another except literally trading physical quantities of one currency for another. If this were true, the above paragraph would make sense, but as I have grown up in a world where a computer can tell me that my $500 USD *already is* £306 GBP, I have trouble accepting that once upon a time, this was actually how that worked.\n\nOriginal source, for those who care (quote on page 77 of 205): https://mises.org/books/economics_in_one_lesson_hazlitt.pdf","answer":"I'm pretty sure thats how it worked. Our money exchanges quite tidily now because its usually numbers on a screen, rather than physical goods or contracts or gold nuggets. Here, the author is saying, international exchange (back then) was a way to indebt other countries into your economy. The English, when buying American goods, had nowhere else to spend the American dollars but on MORE American goods. This is the beginnings of the global economy we have now. \n\ntl:dr Kind of like a gift card for America. "},

{"title":"ELI5: Communism","answer":"The idea is that the workers take control of the government and the factories and split the profits and responsibilities equally without being exploited by the aristocracy. Such a revolution has never happened (all communist revolutions have started because of major political leaders who were already in power (ie already in the aristocracy) have kickstarted the revolutions. \nIt's an interesting system that might work in a perfect world, but doesn't in the real world. In order for communism to succeed, everyone has to work together for the common good. The problem arises in that: 1. Political leaders are not perfect. Not even remotely. Communism would give political officials unchecked authority in the affairs of that country. This means that one corrupt official could essentially lead to the downfall of the state. 2. People aren't perfect. Many are lazy, dishonest, or unskilled. Without being forced to work for $ so that you can eat, many would simply not do their jobs or do them poorly. There's only two ways to get past the 2nd problem: highly motivated people (such as those in religious communities) or force/fear. Socialist religious communities can succeed because of sufficient motivation and because they are relatively small. Communist nations can not last (unless they shift more to the right on the political spectrum) because they are too big and they have no means of motivation other than for the good of the country. This is why they use the threat of deadly force and other violent tactics to keep the population in check. \nSource: AP World History"},

There's typically an interpolation algorithm that tries to guess where the pixels should be when scaling, but there are limits to how accurate it is. Mistakes are made and you can get an end result like that.\n\nYou need an interpolation algorithm or the pixel ratio just increases. Without the algorithm, if you were to scale up a picture by a factor of three in height and width, every pixel just becomes 9 pixel square and everything would look blocky.\n\ntl;dr: the computer can't just stretch an image.

I am not aiming to make karma I just really need to know this.","answer":"If you fail to make payments your insurance company can cancel your insurance.  That has always been the case.\n\nIf you don't have insurance, you are liable for a tax penalty which will be $95 or 1% of your income in 2014.  That is new.  Technically you don't have to pay that penalty.  It will be deducted from your tax refund, but if you owe taxes, you can pay the base amount and not the health insurance penalty fee and the only thing the IRS can do is write a letter.\n\nYou avoid the penalty by having health insurance for the whole year, so failure to pay could result in a tax penalty if you don't get new coverage."},

Most people know what static is through experience, so when someone talks about static it doesn't require much explanation because it's so common, but I was wondering if someone could explain it to me in a clear, simplified way.","answer":"Electricity is the result of a flow of electrons, but static is a word that means, \"stationary.\" So, when you feel static electricity on, say, a balloon, it's because the electrons are stationary on that balloon. Because they're stationary, they're not necessarily flowing yet, they're just accumulating. While they're accumulating, they're building a relatively large charge. Once that's disrupted, it releases the charge.\n\nLike you said, everyone's experienced static. We've all felt static electricity, and one of the easiest ways we can \"play\" with it is by dragging socked feet over a carpet and touching, say, a doorknob (or your roommate). The reason this works is because when you rub your socked feet over the carpet, electrons build up on you and the carpet so that there's a static charge. It's static because the charge isn't moving anywhere. When you touch the doorknob, you're letting those electrons flow from you to the doorknob until there's a relative equal amount of charge between you and the doorknob.\n\nSo, electricity flows. Static electricity is stationary and will begin to flow once contact with something that is unequally charged happens."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why are paintings such as the Mona Lisa such prized pieces when there is much better looking art coming out today?","answer":"There are basic factors like rarity, age, context and authorship. Undoubtedly these turn an OK work into fine art. However they do not fully account for the multimillion pound value of the Mona Lisa. The answer to that lies in \"conspicuous consumption\" - the 'spending of money on and the acquiring of luxury goods and services to publicly display economic power' (as Wikipedia puts it). If there's one painting whose current location the average person knows, it's that. The same for the top pieces of art. There is also a self-reinforcing aspect here, which is to say, the \"legacy and reputation\" of the work. People come to see it because it is famous and it is famous because people come to see it. In the Mona Lisa's case, its popularity was aided by being stolen in a high-profile robbery. The fame then feeds in to the work as a status symbol, which in turn inflates the price."},

Think of bread when it expands. They don't happen overnight, though they can happen within a couple of weeks. During growth spurts or pregnancy, stretch marks can occur pretty fast, but the skin normally shrinks back once the growth stops. That's why Kim Kardashian and other celebrity moms can, with lots of exercising, get flat smooth abs again.\n\nMany factors influence how fast you get stretch marks. I'd be surprised if you got stretch marks within a day. What did you do? \n\nDehydration reduces skin elasticity, as does age, and how well the body repairs itself normally also affects this. A burn victim may have a harder time because their skin in a given area may be scar tissue, which is much weaker than normal skin."},

They were waiting for the tombstone I believe as well... once it was all ready - they laid her to rest. So I wanted to know, what happens to the body while it's waiting for burial? I've always kinda wondered as I thought they'd have to bury the body after a certain point...","answer":"Possibly frozen in a morgue. Unlikely for chemical preservatives to be used, since getting rid of them would be difficult, so freezing is the next logical option."},
{"title":"ELI5: Why don't mountains such as Mt. Everest and Mt. McKinley look as tall as they are said to be in photos?","question_detail":"I understand that sometimes mountains are measured from sea level, but I'm asking about topographical prominence.  The prominence is more or less the height of the peak from the base of the mountain, right?  If so, how come Wikipedia's photo of Everest doesn't appear to be much larger than a modern skyscraper?  Does this have to do with the distance from which the picture was taken?  Or is it simply that the photo has no fame of reference for one to get a grasp of the mountain's enormity?  I am very interested to see a actual photo that gives an idea of just how big these mountains are.  ","answer":"&gt; The prominence is more or less the height of the peak from the base of the mountain, right?\n\nNot always.\n\nWhat constitutes a mountain's base is a subjective measure.  Topological prominence is supposed to do away with that by using an objective measure instead.  \n\nLet's say you were at the peak of one mountain, and walked to the peak of another, higher mountain, trying to lose as little elevations as possible.  Your point of lowest elevation is called the *key col*, and the different between it and the peak you started from is the topological prominence.\n\nThis works well to estimate a mountain's base to peak height, but things sometimes get weird.  When you are the tallest mountain in the range, your key col can be very far away...McKinley's is in Nicaragua and is less than 200 ft above sea level.  And there are tiny hills in the Netherlands whose key col leads them to Everest."},
{"title":"ELI5: Why is India such a densely populated country, unlike Africa which is said to be the birthplace of mankind?","question_detail":"I saw the world population map on the front page and it made me think. Why not Africa and Mongolia?","answer":"Off the top of my head - For a lot of people to live in a small area (definition of dense population), they need three things:\n\n1. Fresh water - Deserts and small islands are out (can’t drink sea water).\n\n2. Good weather - Fresh water by itself won’t do, or the poles would be the most populated regions on earth. Any place too far from the equator is out.\n\n3. Farmland - If you have good weather and lots of water but no land to grow food, you have to hunt it. This means everyone has to run around hunting all day, and move once they eat all the animals. No time to make babies and no food to feed them. What you get is nomadic tribes. Rainforests are out (Sub-Saharan Africa, Amazon… any place too close to the equator). So are windy plains where nothing grows (Central Asia, America).\n\nTurns out the best places where you can find all three in abundance are river deltas and flood plains just north/south of the tropics (and also why all dramatic tales start with “On the banks of the…”). Places like the ones around Egypt’s Nile, Mesopotamia’s Tigris and Euphrates, India’s Indus and Ganga and China’s Yangtze. People who reached these places early got a head start on civilization.\n\nUnfortunately for Egyptians and Mesopotamians, the land they inherited wasn’t as extensive or as fertile as India or China. For example, Not only is India crisscrossed by rivers, its floodplains are so fertile that they generate three harvests a year. THREE. And although the Yangtze is the world’s third longest river, it has the longest stretch of arable land. It flows right across China and supports its biggest cities (Nile flows through a desert and Amazon through a rainforest).\n\nAlso unfortunately for the Egyptians and Mesopotamians, they had no geographic barriers between them and barren plains/ dense forests which tend to generate barbarian hordes that build to a critical mass and sweep across their cities every few centuries or so. Indians had their Himalayas and Hindu Kush while the Chinese had the Tibetan plateau and the wastes of Central Asia (not to say that these stopped invasions, only slowed them).\n\nSo yeah, that’s why India and China always had lots of people. The underlying economics haven’t changed much."},

{"title":"ELI5: How does an indegenious cryogenic engine work?","answer":"It's your basic liquid-fueled rocket engine, just like what the US and the USSR used for the space race, to land men on the Moon, and the space shuttle.  The liquid fuels involved are typically liquified hydrogen and liquified oxygen.  Although kerosene is sometimes used, too, such as in the first stage of the Saturn V rocket.\n\nThe reason for using chilled, liquified gases is that it is simpler to build a rocket to withstand the cold than to contain the pressure.  Cryogenic, liquified gases don't need to be stored under pressure, so the rocket does not have to be strong enough, that is, *heavy* enough, to contain the pressure.  But the rocket must be fueled shortly before lift-off, and ice tends to accumulate: as you may recall, historical footage of a Saturn V lifting off depicts a great many large pieces and flakes of ice being shook off the rocket."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why is slut an insult for solely females, while stud is a complement for solely males?","question_detail":"Just to clarify, I'm male, and I'm just wondering why this is a thing in our culture. \n\nThink about it, if a *male* were to have sex with a large amount of women, he'd be called a stud, I've noticed both genders use that word, stud. When talking about a *female* who has a lot of sex, they call her a slut, both genders use that term also. \n\nWhy is this? I have never heard the terms really interchanged before.","answer":"because our culture - most cultures, actually - are fairly misogynistic.  the exact same behaviors that are exalted in men are reviled in women - it works the other way, too - when men are caring and kind, they are called pussies, which seeks to emasculate them for simply being a good father or husband or human being. when women are strong they are bitches, etc.  people have chosen these defined roles for the genders and it's a really difficult thing to release yourself from.  even when they KNOW it's stupid and doesn't make sense, people sometimes say things anyway that are just archetypes chosen long ago to make that definition abundantly clear and mean nothing.  and there is no lack of stupid peopoe who actually believe in these randomly assigned archetypes.  a raped woman is a slut, a whore, a bitch who should have kept her legs shut - or her mouth shut afterward, because after all, she let it happen, right?  or she was asking for it - as thought that makes ANY logical sense ever in any context.  but men who rape are excused and protected.  it's truly a sign that we are in no way advanced creatures and need to figure our shit out.  religion has a huge part in this as well - the majority of religions are very male-power-based and hellbent on reinforcing that, sometimes to the extent of death for women if they do not obey.  and make no mistake, christianity is right up there with the worst offenders.  women give birth, and are smaller - generally - and that gave men the idea that they were better, oh so long ago.  it's completely random, as far as i'm concerned, but power is a heady thing, and it is used in horrible ways.  does that help to answer your question?  here's a thought for everyone reading this - try changing it.  it's really hard, but every little bit counts."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why is that the element potassium is highly volatile in water, but a banana which has high volumes of potassium doesn't explode in water?","answer":"Elemental potassium is highly reactive because it oxidizes (combines with oxygen) very easily.  This happens whenever it's exposed to oxygen, not just with water.  Water causes a particularly violent reaction because it releases a lot of energy, and constantly exposes new potassium to react (whereas in the air, the reaction is calm enough that potassium forms a skin of oxidized material).\n\nIn a banana, the potassium is already bonded strongly to other elements in a non-reactive material.  In order for a reaction to occur, all the elements in the banana would have to rearrange themselves with the water.  It would take a lot of energy to start that reaction, so the banana doesn't change (much less explode)."},
{"title":"ELI5:If bacteria/virus can mutate to become resistant to our medicine, how come our bodies don't gain any resistance to common diseases no matter how many times we get it?","question_detail":"I get colds like at least 5 times a year... haha","answer":"To answer from an evolutionary perspective, when bacteria become resistant to antibiotics, it happens something like this (all numbers are very, very, inaccurate for explanation's sake)\n\n1.  You have 1 million bacteria in your body of strain X, giving you X-itis.  \n\n2.  You take antibiotics.  You're given enough pills for 2 weeks, but you feel better after 2 days, so you stop taking them.\n\n3.  At that 2 day mark, 999,000 bacteria were killed by your meds.  The 1000 that survived were slightly more resistant to that drug, surviving 2 days worth, even though they wouldn't survive 4 or 5 days worth.\n\n4.  Those 1000 breed, and a few days later you have a million again, except now they're ALL resistant, because their parents were.  \n\nSo you can see, the individual bacteriums didn't become more resistant to our drugs, the weaker ones died, and the stronger (in this instance) thrived.  \n\nThis happens in populations of animals.  We're resistant to diseases that would have been fatal to us millions of years ago because of adaptations: immune response, thick skin, mucus membranes, etc.  But the immune system getting better at dealing with repeat diseases is a very different thing than several million humans dying, and a few thousand survivors breeding."},

{"title":"ELI5: why is there inflation?","question_detail":"I wanna know the root of this.","answer":"I'll never understand this website's love-affair with gold backed...\n\nInflation is the result of a growing economy. The money supply will be impacted as the GDP grows since our productive capacity (and selling capacity) here in the US is increasing. The currency is less valuable in the sense that you are paying a higher notional value for goods, but the entire economy (or at least the \"core economy\") has increased in lock step, and there is more money available, and thus the value in real terms is stable. This has nothing to do with gold or the notion of a backed currency. The Fed attempts to frame monetary policy around this goal with regards to how available money is in the economy (Discount window). \n\nToo much inflation is not a good thing because it causes price instability and wreaks havoc on interest rates. Hyper-inflation (Germany) is the nightmare scenario. Most economists will agree that deflation is worse than inflation on the small scale since it disrupts the credit markets (I can explain this more if you want). \n\nOn to the IOU notion of money and people who think we should gold back our money, first on gold:\n1) vastly inferior industrial applicaton i.e. intrinsic value compared to other physical assets that could back a currency if you insisted on having a backing\n2) vastly unstable price\n\nThe \"back it up\" argument is missing the point. You don't need to back it up because it has intrinsic value - we as a populous say that this is how we trade goods and all agree, therefore it has value - the point being that gold is basically a dummy substitute for money, its really only valuable because we say it is (there are some industrial applications that give it real value of course, but vastly inferior to the fact we just like it, which is why it sits in safes). There is no backing needed as long as that money stands for something. Monetary policy is focused on having the right amount available. "},

Potentially, it could cost less to advertise on one of those if it was in a very low traffic area while it could cost a premium for a static billboard placed near the busiest interchange in the city. Another example would be baseball - the ads on the outfield walls are shown on TV every so often, while the ads behind home-plate are shown each and every pitch.

{"title":"ELI5: Why do my ears get plugged during takeoff/landing on an airplane?","question_detail":"?","answer":"Air pressure is higher the closer you are to the ground, because of gravity. On the ground, there's a 100 kilometres of air pushing all the air down. As you rise, there's less and less air, because there's, in turn, less air to push it down.\n\nThe aeroplane's cabin isn't pressurised to ground-level - in fact, most commercial passenger jets maintain a cabin pressure equivalent to ~2000 metres (~7000 feet) above-sea-level altitude. When the plane descends below that, the cabin pressure gets equalised with outside pressure, and when it takes off from the ground, the air pressure drops until it reaches the final cabin pressure.\n\nThe effect is similar to closing your nose and mouth and trying to inhale/exhale - except this time, you're varying pressure from the inside of the ear membrane, whereas on the airplane, the pressure change comes from the outside."},

You end up learning the following fields (in no particular order):\n\n1) Statics.\n\n2) Dynamics and kinetics (particularly mechanisms).\n\n3) Fluid mechanics/dynamics (how fluids behave when stressed/flow).\n\n4) Solid mechanics (same as the above for fluids, but with solid matter).\n\n5) Thermodynamics (how energy is transferred inside a system).\n\nYou also typically learn various numerical methods (which are used to solve problems faster than normal \"guess and check\" methods). This usually also requires a background in programming that most schools (at least, those here in the States) offer to freshman.\n\nOn top of all that, you get a healthy does of physics and calculus, with dashes of chemistry and statistics.\n\nFinally, you typically take a few design courses, which just run you through various ways to design and test devices.\n\nEdit: Forgot the 2nd half of OP's question. I don't know exactly how some of this would apply to engineers in the UK, but I can offer the perspective of what it is like here in the US.\n\nWhat you do when you get your degree is dependent on what you're interested in, honestly. Most of the time, you end up working a desk job, designing parts on a computer or running an analysis. Most of the calculations we do can't really be done by hand anymore, and more or less require the processing power a computer can give. This isn't unique to MEs though: in the modern world, unless you work in service or sales, or you have a niche job, *you will work a desk.*\n\nI will say that most of the more interesting ME jobs out there would probably require a more advanced degree (MS or PhD in ME), which means spending another 2-6 years in school *after* you get your bachelors. Most R&amp;D jobs in particular look for PhDs.\n\nThat being said, you tend to get paid more. Average starting salary for college graduates in the US ranges from 30-40k, while starting salary for MEs typically runs 50-65k. Tacking another 2 years of school for a MS bumps you to the 60-70k starting bracket. PhD starting salary is pretty wonky, and really depends on where you go. Some engineers in the States also tack on a Masters in Business Administration (MBA). The degree is honestly worthless to an engineer, but many companies want their managers to have it, so it puts you on the fast track.\n\nThe last thing is getting your professional license, which allows you to sign off on large-scale projects. It is guaranteed job security, and you can expect your salary to jump 10-15k if you get it."},

I'm talking about people who live with their parents into their 30s, 40s, and 50s. \n\nEdit: I'm also not talking about cultures where living with extended family is the norm -- where people marry and bring their spouses back to live with their family, and raise their children with help from the grandparents. I'm talking about people who use their parents to hide from the world, never date or marry, and basically never branch out to become an adult individual at all. ","answer":"It's not really mental illness. There could be many reasons why they still live at home. One, they can't afford to be on their own. Two, they can't find a job. Three, they aren't responsible enough to be on their own. There are probably more. My older sister still lives at home with us. She had a kid in high school (her kid also lives with us), can't support herself, let alone another human being. She hasn't had a real job in years, she got fired because she doesn't know how to be responsible (staying out until 3am when she knows she has to wake up for work). She can't (or won't) clean up after herself, constantly forgets things, and if not for my mom, she would literally sleep in bed all day long. She's not really fit to live on her own.

If a charge is fraudulent or incorrect you only need to deal with your credit card company; talk to them and have the charge removed. The credit card company is then in the position of recouping that cost from the vendor that made the charge, and they will do that easily.\n\nWhat likely occurred is that the cashier was stealing from Sears.

{"title":"ELI5: What's the deal with Mt. Gox? Why is it getting so much hate?","answer":"Mt Gox was the first big Bitcoin exchange, allowing people to trade dollars (and other national currencies) for Bitcoins.  Since it was the first player to the show it wound up taking a huge market share--if you wanted to trade Bitcoins then you were going to pretty much have to go with Mt Gox.\n\nHowever, they didn't grow terribly gracefully.  They failed to keep up with the growing demand as Bitcoin gained popularity.  Around a year ago (last April) they were lagging anywhere from 10 minutes to a few hours behind, which is to say that if you clicked the button to sell then you would get whatever the price happened to be in 10 minutes, not the price now.  That opened the doors for various types of manipulation and ultimately triggered the crash from &gt;$200/Bitcoin to ~$50/Bitcoin.\n\nThe next strike against Mt Gox was a few months ago when they stopped letting people withdraw their national currencies (Dollars, Pounds, Euros, etc) except Yen--they are based in Japan.  They cited issues with a US Banking partner.  They also have a lot of money ($75 million) tied up in a lawsuit--they broke a contract with CoinLab, a Seattle-based startup that was to manage US and Canadian operations.  When this news hit it caused the price to appear artificially high--people were unable to withdraw their fiat (e.g. Dollars) so if they wanted to withdraw at all they have to convert into Bitcoin.\n\nSeveral weeks ago the next development started.  Mt Gox uses their own software to interface with the Bitcoin network.  Their software was a little sloppy in one area, but it was close enough to specification that everything went smoothly (technical:  they included leading zeroes on their digital signatures, like writing the number 73 as 073).  A few weeks ago the Bitcoin protocol was patched to discourage this sloppy technique--it made it so that if someone doesn't follow slightly stricter rules when publishing transactions to the network their transaction gets glossed over.  It still *could* be confirmed by the network, but there's no guarantee.  This led to a lot of withdrawals failing.  To fix the problem they published all of the data, in an attempt at transparency.  Some people saw the mistake, fixed it, and re-transmitted the transactions.  This, however, revealed a much more serious issue with their code--\"transaction malleability.\"\n\nThe idea of transaction malleability is that each transaction has a unique ID number--a name, if you will.  The name is computed based on the data in the transaction.  It turns out that if you change the transaction at all the ID number changes as well.  Generally this should be no issue--the digital signature would become invalid if you change the sender or the recipient.  However, it turns out that you can add zeroes in front of the digital signature and not change its value (e.g. 73 and 073 are the same number), which means you can essentially rename a transaction that someone else sends.  If that person was relying on the transaction ID for their bookkeeping then you can slip a transaction past them and they won't realize that their transaction was confirmed since it was renamed.  Mt Gox was especially vulnerable to this attack since their transactions were in the non-standard form, so someone renaming their transactions would actually come up with a transaction that is more likely to be confirmed than the original one.\n\nWhen this exploit was uncovered it was pretty obvious to most of the community that it was something required a certain amount of social engineering to exploit--you have to withdraw money once, carry out the malleability attack, then complain that your money was never sent and receive a credit; a company would be foolish to not check that the transaction did, indeed, fail.  However, that didn't stop Mt Gox from throwing Bitcoin under the bus for their own incompetence--they wrote a press release that implied that the issue was new (it's been known since 2011) and that it certainly affects all other exchanges and services (they got lucky here--several services were affected, but by no means all; most were only vulnerable to attacks that amount to an annoyance more than an actual theft).  They took a *ton* of flack for this.\n\nWhen the malleability issue hit, Mt Gox suspended Bitcoin withdrawals \"temporarily.\"  At that point the better way to get money off of Gox was to convert back to fiat and hope that a bank transfer goes through.  This led to a massive panic on Gox, which bled over to the other exchanges.  This would have all been acceptable if they fixed their issues in any reasonable time frame.  However, instead they have chosen to string the community along with less and less substantial promises.  Their most recent correspondence essentially amounts to \"We've gone into hiding, stop asking for your money back.\"  There's been evidence of unfair trading with this most recent news, too--the price reacted about an hour before the news was public.\n\nOver the past few years Mt Gox has triggered most of the panics in the Bitcoin price through either incompetence (e.g. getting hacked) or actual criminal activity.  At this point the question isn't why is it getting so much hate, it's why does it still command any shred of respect at all. "},

What is their purpose?","question_detail":"Follow up questions: What causes the \"whites vs. blacks\" disputes in prisons\"? How do inmates make shanks?","answer":"From what i have heard first hand from my best friend(an ex-con), there are several key reasons. \nFeeling high and mighty is absolutely one of them. But, besides just a warm fuzzy feeling, power in prison can come with many rewards. \n\nStealing food, commissary (snacks, hygiene products, some small electronics and more) from another inmate with no repercussions? Much easier if you are considered a \"badass gangster\", and even more so if you are part of an established posse or gang. Other inmates know your gang will protect you if they try to fight back, and they fear that. \n\nMoving and acquiring drugs and illegal(or banned) substances such as tobacco and weapons is also a key reason. The more people you have willing to do what you say means better ability to get things accomplished. \n\nAs far as the white vs. black disputes? I would have to sadly say it is probably just leftover racial segregation, and a tendency to \"stick to one's own kind.\"\n\nAnd finally shanks: everyone in prison has a job. On those jobs, there are many items that can be stolen and made into shanks. Pieces of heavy gauge wire from fencing, silverware from the kitchen, some items from the laundry area, and pretty much anything that can be found while working outside. In many prisons there are also inmates who drive tractors for a job. \nThe prisons my BFF was in, and most of the ones he has experienced, were mostly inmate controlled. This means inmates had jobs that had a lot of clearance- access to the library, administrative areas, even being able to go in and outside (into the courtyard-not out into the public hah).\nThese objects are then filed on the concrete floors, walls, etc. to make them dangerously pointy. My friend even saw someone who had a shank made from a LAWNMOWER blade! \n\nHope this answers all your questions :)"},

Electrons are attracted to a positive electrode, but fly through/past it and to the front of the screen. There they hit colored phosphor dots, which when excited by the electrons give off red, blue or green light (three different types of dot).  Typically, each color dot has its own electron gun, so there are actually three electron beams, one for each color.  \n  \nThe electron beam scans left to right, from the top of the screen to the bottom. This is accomplished by \"steering\" the beam with electric fields, since electrons are pulled towards positive charges and away from negative charges.  When the beam reaches the right side of the tube or the bottom right corner, it is \"blanked out\" temporarily.   \n  \nBy making the electron beam stronger (more electrons) or weaker (fewer) the amount of light emitted by the phosphors at any spot can be made brighter or dimmer.  By doing this with three colors, not only can overall intensity be changed, but the color, too.   \n  \nBy doing this all very rapidly, a picture can be painted onto the screen. And by rapidly changing that picture, frame after frame, it appears that the pictures are moving.  "},

{"title":"[ELI5] - How do they measure how many calories are in food?","answer":"They use a device called a calorimeter.

You then burn whatever you want to measure and it heats up water in side the chamber. The amount of energy that gets put into the water must be equal to the amount of energy released since there energy cannot go anywhere else (since it is isolated). The definition of a calorie is the amount of energy it takes to raise 1 gram of water 1 degree celsius. This is for little calories. The calories you see on cookie boxes are big calories. You can see the difference because a little calorie has a lower case c which you will almost never see. The larger Calorie represents 1000 calories. So that jar of cookies you just ate is actually thousands and thousands of little calories. A large calorie represents the amount of energy it take to increase the temperature of 1000 grams of water 1 degree Celsius. "},

It is called [Hypernatraemia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypernatremia).\n\nWhat you probably mean to say/ask is just that we eat more than the *recommended* amount of sodium.  This causes the body to retain water to dilute the sodium (one aspect of the \"keep things in balance\" way our body works).  This means more liquid in our bodies, including in our blood, so our heart has to pump more/harder and our kidneys have to work more too.\n\nThat means higher blood pressure which can make our blood vessels/arteries stuff, causing heart disease and stroke and stuff, and our kidneys can get worn out/damaged quicker in some cases.\n\nAlso when you pee out the extra sodium you pee out more calcium.

They would have as much impact on technology as the solid-state silicon transistor did.\n\nJust off the top of my head:  \n\nGreenhouse gas emissions would be massively reduced.  \n\nA substantial amount of the electricity that is generated is lost during transmission.  Those losses would stop, so the electricity that was being lost would not need to be generated so less fossil fuel would be burned.\n\nLots of electrical devices on the grid would become massively more efficient.  Think about how much heat your computer generates.  That heat is caused in part due to the fact that the components aren't superconducting.  Multiply your computer by the refrigerators, HVAC systems, etc. in every house and every factory and think about how much electricity would be saved by not wasting it as heat.\n\nLevitating platforms:\n\nSuperconductors and magnetic levitation go together hand &amp; glove.  Using maglev without superconductors is expensive and requires a lot of energy (electricity).  With superconductors, you can make magnetic levitation work for widespread commercial vehicles.\n\nThey would replace elevators.\n\nThey would find their way into all sorts of unexpected applications - without the need for expensive gear you could put \"lifts\" in all sorts of places, just for aesthetics.\n\nHuvr?  Maybe.\n\nMuch faster computers:\n\nRight now the speed that computer chips operate is limited by how much heat they produce (see above).  With superconductors we might be able to manufacture circuits that can operate at much higher speeds without generating enough heat to melt them.  Faster computers imply new domains of potential application; strong AI, for example."},

It might instead have bought highways, bridges, schools etc. \n\nOf course, the state needs to cover these expenses and often does so by borrowing money (Government Bonds (in your example, remember the posters for 'War bonds'?) (or by printing money) against a promise to pay via future tax income. \n\nBefore the 2nd world war started, your President Roosevelt started a blended program of government investment/spending (which would have increased demand for goods, services and created jobs) called New deal. This was also done in most major countries in europe; indeed many buildings, community housing, railroads, bridges etc were constructed in 1933-1938. \n\nConsider that you wrote \"hiring\" soldiers - the state might have used the young men and women to do something else than go to war - i.e. dig roads or build shelters.

{"title":"ELI5: Whats the big threat with antibiotics?","question_detail":"Are they going to stop being effective?\n\nAll of them?\n\nWhy?\n\nWhat effect will this have?","answer":"Another point of importance, aside from the ones already covered, is that antibiotics are not some kind of magic fairy dust that only removes the harmful stuff. They don't just aim for the bad guys. They can kill beneficial cells along with harmful ones, and can make you quite sick in their own right.\n\nFinally, there's also the problem of weakening the entire population's immune system. Our immune systems are adaptive, and  they get stronger when they're exposed to a lot of stuff. This is one of the principles behind vaccination, for example.\n\nSo. We use a lot of antibiotics, a lot of common bacterial diseases die, the immune systems of our children never have to deal with them and get much weaker. It's like anti-vaccination. So when the really heavy super-antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria pop up, we're even *less* prepared to deal with them since we never had to deal with their more common variants and our immune systems aren't nearly as buff as they used to be."},

{"title":"ELI5: How did the Roman Empire with all of its might lose to the Visigoths?","question_detail":"I cant fathom this","answer":"Well the thing that you have to realize about the Roman Empire is that they had to make a conscious choice between choosing to field soldiers and having people left over to farm and perform other necessary jobs. The Roman army at the time of the Barbarian (Goth) invasions was about 300,000 soldiers. Also, not all of the Roman soldiers were in the area where the Goths attacked (The Rhine and Danube River Frontiers). The Numbers of Barbarians crossing in to Roman Territory was huge. \n\nNext, back during the time of Augustus (beginning of the empire) around the time of Jesus Christ. The Romans were so much more advanced then the barbarians that defeating the hoardes was just a matter of fielding enough troops. But as time progressed, the goths learned a more and more about how the Romans fought, and picked up more and more Roman equipment. \n\nBy 410, the Roman forces were so stretched from fighting the Barbarians on the Rhine and the Danube and The Persains in the East. This coupled with the fact that the visigoths were constantly growing more and more advanced led to the Sack of Rome."},

The problem is that we are not techie at all and so those numbers mean nothing to us about speed, accessibility, etc. Please ELI5 the differences between these options!","answer":"They really should have something in the middle here. 2Mb/s isn't enough these days, but 100Mb/s is just a waste unless you know what it means and know you have a use for it.\n\nAlso be sure to check what you get upstream. In other words the speed at which you can upload things. Upstream is useful when you want to upload larger files for instance. Having something silly like 2-5 up will also impact your download speed. \nA lot of companies try to get away with things here as they have to pay for your traffic out on the internets. You should get at least 10Mb/s up with 100 down.\n\nAs they offer 100Mb/s it's either fiber or access through cable TV infrastructure.

{"title":"ELI5: If blind people dream with sounds, how do people like Helen Keller dream?","answer":"&gt; Before her teacher first came to her, Helen Keller, in her autobiography, stated “My dreams have strangely changed during the past twelve years. Before and after my teacher first came to me, they were devoid of sound, of thought or emotion of any kind, except fear, and only came in the form of sensations. I would often dream that I ran into a still, dark room, and that, while I stood there, I felt something fall heavily without any noise, causing the floor to shake up and down violently; and each time I woke up with a jump. As I learned more and more about the objects around me, this strange dream ceased to haunt me; but I was in a high state of excitement and received impressions very easily. It is not strange then that I dreamed at the time of a wolf, which seemed to rush towards me and put his cruel teeth deep into my body! I could not speak (the fact was, I could only spell with my fingers), and I tried to scream; but no sound escaped from my lips. It is very likely that I had heard the story of Red Riding Hood, and was deeply impressed by it. This dream, however, passed away in time, and I began to dream of objects outside myself.”\n\nPlus, we have [more than 5 senses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense#Other_senses).

{"title":"ELI5: Why do some people get food allergies?","question_detail":"I mean, it doesn't make sense that some people are allergic to nuts or shellfish.","answer":"It's been a while since I've taken my immunology course, but I'll try to answer to the best of my ability.  Someone please correct me if I go off course.\n\nBasically, it starts all the way back in the bone marrow where your B cells mature.  Each individual B cell recombines its genes randomly, and as a result, recognizes one specific type of antigen, which could be anything from a protein found in the common cold to a protein found in the skin of an almond.  The only thing your body really checks for before letting the B cells mature is whether or not they're reactive to self-antigens, which is the stuff that makes your body up.\n\nSome of these mature B cells produce IgE antibodies.  The historical function of IgE antibodies is to defend against large parasites such as round worms, which is important later.  \n\nThe neat thing about IgE is that it's almost non-existent in your blood serum.  That is because, almost immediately after it's produced by B plasma cells, it bonds to mast cells/basophils/dendritic cells.  When a person is allergic to something, their B plasma cells specific for that antigen replicate and churn out A LOT of IgE that's specific for that protein antigen found in that almond or shellfish.  In turn, your mast cells, which would usually be covered in a lot of different IgE molecules and therefore less likely to react, become sensitized to the antigen.  This means that it takes a lot less of the antigen in your system to activate the mast cell and cause a process called degranulation.  Degranulation is what releases the interleukins responsible for your inflammatory response.\n\nThe extent of the allergic response depends on just how sensitized a person's immune system is to the particular antigen.  \n\nOh, and back to the whole \"IgE antibodies being responsible for defense against parasites thing.\"  The United States has a lot more allergy sufferers than does someone living in a third world country.  It's theorized that, because Americans don't have the level of parasitic infection that poorer nations do, that part of our immune system essentially gets bored and is looking for SOMETHING to do, so it reacts to things that historically weren't deemed harmful.\n\nAlso, I have no idea why some foods are more likely to cause allergic reactions than others.  Either I've just forgotten, or my professor had no idea."},

{"title":"ELI5:Why do they always announce the DOW, NASDAQ & S&P on the news/radio programs? What does it all mean?","answer":"gross generalizations follow: Sometimes the change in the number day to day is more important than the actual number of a given day. Each of these is a measure of economic health/performance in sectors of the economy in the United States.  Movement up means investors are optimistic that they can make money - that the economy or a given sector (manufacturing, healthcare, airlines, etc) is going to do well and the stocks for those companies will be worth more in the near future. When the numbers are down (The Dow lost 300 points today) it means investors are getting rid of stocks and otherwise investing less in the market because they believe the risk/likelihood is such that they might loose money. \n\nSo basically these indicate optimism or pessimism in the marketplace on a given day. When the economies crash a few years back some of these numbers dropped by 40+% in a few weeks time. This means a huge amount of money was lost and/or taken out of the markets. "},
{"title":"ELI5: What was the average day for a human during the hunter-gatherer days?","question_detail":"I.e. what time would they wake up? Sunrise? Before that? Would they travel all day or during a specific time? ","answer":"Our best idea comes from current hunter-gatherer peoples living around the world. They had a diverse array of skills, cultures and customs that effect their day to day life. In some cultures women do most of the gathering, and men hunting. In others it is more equal (e.g. the [Agta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeta_people)). Childcare on the whole tends to be more equally shared among all group members, not just the responsibility of the mother. \n\nDays usually begin at or before sunrise. Preparing fires, cleaning and getting ready for the day. Depending on climate it makes more sense to collect food during the early part of the day when it isn't as hot.\n\nSome cultures food was dominated by fish and ocean products, others which lived in forests or savannahs might have relied more heavily on tubers, wild fruits and vegetables. For most hunter-gatherer societies the staples in the diet, and the majority of the diet consisted of collected foodstuffs (fruits, tubers, eggs, vegetables) and less on meat. Small game is much easier and less risky to catch compared to large game. Modern hunter-gatherer societies like the Kung! in Africa collect small game every 1-3 days, but larger game every ~45 days. So those pictures of early man hunting rhinos, large elk and elephants isn't a very accurate picture at all. Before 10,000 years ago hunter-gatheres did not have access to any of our domestic animals, crops or food. This includes just about everything you find in a modern supermarket from tomatoes, to eggs, to meat. They only had access to wild foodstuffs, unaltered by artificial selection. They would not have have cows, pigs, chickens or sheep they could have only hunted wild animals and collected wild eggs. They didn't have any modern grains because they didn't have agriculture. \n\nMany of these people were nomadic, especially if their food was. But some people could be more sedentary if their food sources were more reliable (e.g. tribes living near the ocean). \n\nMost people live in small groups consisting of close kin. Sometimes culture dictated that the female move to her husbands tribe. In others the husband moves to the women's tribe. Sometimes men could have more than one wife, or women could have more than one husband. "},

{"title":"ELI5: How do the Crayola Crystal Effects Markers Crystallize?","question_detail":"My 2 year old has these really cool window markers that after a little while crystallize.  Its very easy to clean up so its not like diamonds forming on the glass or anything, just visual effects.  How do they work?  I tried testing different things.  Even writing a word out, some letters changed way before others.  I couldn't trigger the effect either by blowing on it or touching it (like the box advertises).  It was a very cool effect to watch though.  Once a line started to crystallize, it was like a fuse.","answer":"I have never seen these markers but it sounds like a saturated solution and you're triggering the first crystal to form by introducing something for the first crystal to adhere to as it falls out of solution. All subsequent molecules adhere to the original one, making a chain reaction. A lot like making rock candy on a string with sugar water. You heat the water so more sugar will go into solution, bring the temp down, introduce string and the now super saturated solution crystallizes out. If I had to guess, I would assume the marker company is using a salt of some sort. Either NaCL or KCl. It will crystallize on its own, but some water or other solvent would have to evaporate (dry) first."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why do so many diets emphasize cutting carbs (partially or completely)?","answer":"Well for one, cutting carbs completely is a terrible idea, but that is another discussion.

{"title":"ELI5:When/How/Why did the USA become so anti-vaccine?","answer":"Because modern medicine has become so good, that people have stopped accepting the answer \"We don't know\" even when that's the case.  So when these people have autistic children and ask their doctor they reject the \"we don't know\" answer.\n\nDesperately they take to the internet and support groups to seek the answers that they KNOW must exist.  Mostly they are looking for someone or something to blame, so they can stop feeling like it's their own fault. \n\nA few years ago, a doctor took a bribe to publish a paper claiming that vaccines and autism have a link.  The doctor was discredited and stripped of his credentials, but the \"answer\" was now out there. \n\nDesperate people grabbed onto it like it would save their children.  It feels true to the parents because symptoms of autism often first present at around the same time as we normally give children doses of vaccines. \n\nIt's entirely a coincidence.  Children normally don't act autistic when they are babies because babies don't realy act like much of anything.  Certainly the kind of variations we see with autism would not be visible in a baby, it's gotta grow a little into a toddler before you can see the signs. Same reasons that we give vaccines at around that time.  You can't give it to a baby as they are to weak, but it's beneficial to give as soon as possible, so we give them to toddlers. \n\nWhen you combine all this with a general distrust of scientists in our culture.  People form large conspiracy theories and we end up where we are.  \n\nIt's also worth pointing out that vaccines have realy done their job to well.  The deaths they can eliminate have been eliminated for so long that the current generation of parents have never realy lived in a world with these diseases.  I'm 30, and if I talk to my parents generation it's not uncommon to hear about siblings who died as babies from one disease or another.  It's incredibly common, but for people of my generation it's almost unheard of.  So they see only the danger of the vaccines (because they see autistic kids all over the place) but not the benefit, because they don't know anyone who's died of the mumps. "},
{"title":"ELI5:Can you gain more than 1 lb of fat from eating 1 lb of food?","answer":"You can not gain a pound of fat from a pound of lard. The liver takes ingested fat and breaks it down. This process of breaking down the fat produces energy. This energy can be used throughout the body. Since a pound of lard produces way more energy than you need at any given time it takes some of that energy and stores it. The body stores energy in the form of fat so now it must take the fat it just broke down and make more fat which requires energy. The problem is that breaking down fat produces less energy than it takes to make fat. \n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5:Why are storm clouds darker than regular clouds?","answer":"\"black\" due to two chief reasons:1) optical thickness and 2) viewpoint and/or background (contrast). Concerning optical thickness: it is a technical term that just means that a thicker cloud has more droplets of water for the light to scatter off of. This can be due to either the physical thickness of the cloud or the density of the droplets, or both. For a sufficiently thick cloud (that has sufficient optical thickness) a bunch of the light is scattered back in the general direction from which it came as well as sideways and forwards, to there's just not as much light getting \"through\" the cloud to the ground. Up in the sky, thin clouds (like cirrus clouds) usually look white, but not thick clouds. The thicker ones look dark, but they are really just darker than the sky. It is the contrast that makes them look \"black\"."},

We haven't even been around the longest time. Better yet, why don't all species have a way to intercommunicate.","answer":"It's because of our more complex brains:\n\n    \"Many people assume the physical basis of language lies in the lips, the tongue, or the ear.  But deaf and mute people can also possess language fully.  People who have no capacity to use their vocal cords may still be able to comprehend language and use its written forms.  And human sign language, which is based on visible gesture rather than the creation of sound waves, is an infinitely creative system just like spoken forms of language.  But the basis of sign language is not in the hand, just as spoken language is not based in the lips or tongue.

{"title":"ELI5: What does too much salt, fat, calories, and sugar actually do to your body?","answer":"You can divide this up into the salt and the other 3.\n\nFat and carbohydrates (sugar) are just different types of calories (along with protein). Your body evolved in a time when it didn't know where your next meal was coming from. If you take in extra calories, it is going to store them (as fat) for tomorrow, when you might not have anything to eat. \n\nThink of stored fat like a gas tank on a car, except the tank can expand. If every day you put in more petrol than the car burns, first the tank is going to get full, then its going to start growing. If you keep filling it up its going to keep expanding and start messing with other parts of the car (painful analogy). If you exercise (burn more gas) or improve your diet (less fuel) the fuel tank will start shrinking. \n\nSalt is a bit more tricky. For background - water likes to follow things that are dissolved in it (eli5 way of explaining [osmosis](http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/osmosis)). Salt dissolves in water, if you eat salt it is then dissolved in you. Your kidneys work to get rid of excess water, and they do this (mainly) by excreting sodium and letting the water follow it. In people with hypertension (high blood pressure) getting rid of sodium from their diet (which results in your body holding onto less water) has been shown to reduce blood pressure. Its a bit more controversial in people with normal blood pressure as to whether it makes a difference. \n\nDoes that answer your question?"},

{"title":"ELI5: When you right click while using an old computer and it freezes for a few seconds, what is it doing?","question_detail":"What causes a computer to freeze up temporarily?","answer":"You're literally interrupting the computer.  Don't feel bad about it: that's how it's designed (and what it's called).\n\nMost operating systems and software aren't continually polling the mouse (i.e. asking it where it's at, or what it's doing)--that's an inefficient use of processing power and system resources.  When something *does* happen (you move your mouse, or press a button) it interrupts the processor (or usually, lets it know that it has to pay attention to the mouse).\n\nMost computers these days have so much power that their multiple central processing units (CPUs) are sleeping more often than not, and its memory (the RAM) is not full.  Older computers (in their day, and running the software that was around then) were like that too.  \n\nHowever, running more modern (and demanding) software, older processors are easily overwhelmed and sometimes have to dedicate themselves for a long time (computer-wise) to completing tasks.  So when it's doing that, it sometimes takes a while to get around to your interruption (or to dump what it's doing and fetch the resources to deal with your mouse click or mouse movement).  And then it has to reload what it was doing before.  Sometimes (as determined by the programming), the computer just ignores an interrupt or service request (why your mouse goes all choppy when you're just moving it around while the system is busy).\n\n**TL;DR: Your computer is busy, and you're interrupting it to move your mouse around**"},

{"title":"ELI5: How do Hazmat Suits work?","answer":"It depends on the level.\n\nIn general HAZMAT suits (hazardous material suit) protect the wearer from potential harmful substances. \n\nThere are four levels:\n\nA, the highest - It creates an artificial environment on the inside. These are sealed air tight and have positive pressure. If these are torn the positive inside pressure flows outside the suit. This prevents the dangerous substance from entering in the event of a malfunction or tear.\n\nB, second highest- These aren't air tight. However, these are typically water tight and prevent any 'splash materials' from getting on skin. This level also comes with SCBA (normally) or a respirator (less frequently) to prevent inhaling dangerous particles.\n\nC, second lowest- This is basically the same as level B. However, instead of SCBA its worn with just a respirator. Level C doesn't help with oxygen deficient environments whereas level B does.\n\nD, lowest- This is just basic protection.

{"title":"ELI5:What would sunsets/surises look like on a larger planet?","question_detail":"Or a smaller planet? Or faster rotating planet?","answer":"Well size is not as important as distance except in rotation. A larger planet at the same distance with an equal rotation to circumference would have extremely similar sunrises and sunsets in time only. Now the composition of the atmosphere is important as to the look of the sunrise and sunset so different atmospheres would produce different looking events. The faster rotating planet would speed up the process of the sunrise or set, but would have to be a greatly differing rotation to greatly affect the time frame in which they lasted. The earth rotates at 1000 miles per hour which is what creates roughly a 24 hour day across the 25000 mile circumference. So the planet in question would have to rotate faster based on its circumference to speed up or slow down a sunrise or set. So if you have a planet with a 48000 mile circumference rotating 2000 miles per hour you still end up with a 24 hour day so everything would be quite similar. You would have to have a planet of equal circumference rotating at about speed and a half to really notice a difference. This is partly due to the distance from the earth to the sun, if you lengthen that distance the size of the sun over the horizon would be smaller. If you shorten it the sun would be larger. Both would also change the time frame in which the sun stays at the horizon."},

However, a lot of people who get divorced have multiple divorces.\n\nThe divorce rate for first marriages is closer to 30%.  The divorce rate number is skewed by the fact that if you've already divorced once, you're much more likely to divorce again.  It's about 60% for second marriages, and 75% for third.  (IMHO, if you've gotten divorced 2 or 3 times already, it's time to ditch the \"til death do us part\" thing, and just stick with live-in GF/BF status. You're not fooling anyone.)"},

{"title":"ELI5: Why does drinking loads of milk make people vomit?","answer":"I assume you are asking in reference to the milk challenge?\n\nThere are two answers.\n\n1 - lactose tolerance, some have more than others, but we all have a point where our bodies can't digest it and have to purge.\n\n2 - Cheese. When milk gets warm (such as being in a 98 degree sac, reacting with acid) it starts to form curds (the chunky bits from when milk goes bad) which is less dense, causing expansion. Your stomach is already full of milk, so when it starts to expand, it pushes out via pathway of least resistance."},

{"title":"ELI5: The difference between different types of guns.","question_detail":"I have never been able to understand anything about guns. When people are talking about them it makes me feel brain dead.","answer":"Some handguns are revolvers.  A rotating cylinder holds typically 6 rounds of ammunition.  Each time the trigger is pulled, a fresh round is brought in line with the barrel, the hammer strikes the primer and the cartridge fires.  When all 6 rounds have been discharged, the cylinder must be swung out, the now-empty cartridges ejected, and fresh cartridges inserted.\n\nOther handguns are called pistols.  They operate semi-automatically: each time the trigger is pulled, a round of ammunition is discharged; the recoil forces are used to cycle the gun's action.  Each cycle of the action ejects the spent round and loads a fresh round until the magazine is empty.  The shooter must release and press the trigger once again to fire each round.\n\nRifles are typically bolt-action, lever action, or semi-automatic.  The first two require the shooter to manually operate the action to eject a spent round and load a fresh round from the magazine.  The last one works just like a semi-automatic pistol.\n\nSome firearms can be fired fully-automatically: as long as the trigger is held down, the action will load, fire, and eject rounds of ammunition until the magazine is empty.  We typically refer to such firearms as machine guns; they can take the form of pistols or rifles."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why does the gears screech when I put the car in reverse while rolling forward, but not when I put in a forward going gear while rolling backwards?","question_detail":"I hope the wording makes sense, English isn't my first language.","answer":"The reverse gear in a transmission has a much higher ratio than the first forward gear (think about how fast you can go in reverse before hitting the red-line vs how fast you can go in first gear before the red line). \n\nBecause of this when the car is moving forward at low speed, the transmission input shaft is spinning much slower than it needs to be to complete the shift into reverse smoothly. This is partially because the idler gear has to be sped up along with the reverse gear itself, but mostly because the reverse often doesn't have a synchro (a device which helps the gear selector engage the gear smoothly). \n\nGoing the other way from reverse to forward, the input shaft is spinning too fast, however the first gear synchro is designed to overcome this and helps smooth the shift. \n\nSince you said English is not your first language, let me know if you are confused by any of the terminology and I'll try to break it down further."},

{"title":"ELI5: What represents the amount of fuel I am burning whilst driving; the RPM dial or how far my accelerator pedal is pushed down?","question_detail":"Edit: I drive a manual hatch-back with no fuel economy meter","answer":"Neither is really a good indicator because they can't allow for variance in engine load.  If you want a cheap \"fuel economy\" gauge go down to your local auto parts store and get a mechanical vacuum gauge.  Engine vacuum is directly related to both load and efficiency as well as a good indicator of engine health.  The higher the vacuum the less air is getting past the throttle and being mixed with fuel in the engine.  The gauge is super easy to install you just have to T it into an existing vacuum line and run a line through a bulkhead on your firewall.\n\nNotes: this doesn't work on some diesels as they don't have an actual throttle plate but instead are regulated by fuel availability.  Also, I know that there is no such thing as vacuum IRL but they don't make engine air pressure differential gauges.  It's a case of the industry being too lazy to adopt new information just like all the wiring diagrams using conventional electron flow instead of actual (we thought electricity ran backwards for a long time, found out we were wrong, and the auto industry changed nothing outside of engineering.)"},

{"title":"ELI5:What is cortisone and why is it bad for your health?","question_detail":"I have the understanding that it does wonders in treating some conditions but apparently has some serious side effects. What are those and why is it bad for health?","answer":"(hydro)Cortisone and other corticosteroids are equivalent to the human stress-hormone cortisol, synthesized by the adrenal glands in response to injury, illness, stress, low blood sugar etc.  It´s primary function is to accommodate an increased-demand state (a \"crisis\"), by elevating blood sugar, suppressing the immune system (no time to fight infection when you are about to bleed out or starve to death), and basically (together with adrenaline) shuttle all available resources in the body towards making us able to survive the current crisis. \n\nHowever, when corticosteroids (hydrocortisone etc.) are given to you as medication over time, the body is continuously forced to neglect several important maintenance and homeostasis (\"harmonizing\") mechanisms because it is kept in this high-demand, crisis state. With time, corticosteroids therefore give problems as poor wound healing, diabetes/high blood sugar, high blood pressure, increased risk of infection, psychiatric problems (depression, aggression), decreased fertility etc. \n\nBottom line: Hydrocortisone and other corticosteroids are great at decreasing immune response, helping patients with an overactive immune system (such as in autoimmune disease). However, the side-effects can be severe and in a long-term perspective, these medications can be quite awful. Assessment of risk-vs-benefit dictates how the story goes. "},

We may have mixed with even more ancient hominid species, but we haven't discovered any genetic evidence of this yet. As far as living animals go, our sperm can penetrate eggs within the ape family, but our genes are incompatible with other apes anyway. So yes, our DNA just can't.\n\nChimps, our closest relatives, are generally agreed to be too far removed from us for successful interbreeding. But that didn't stop [a crazy Russian scientist from trying](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanzee).

{"title":"Eli5: what actually causes someone to lose consciousness when hit hard in a fight.","answer":"Well, this is the explanation I heard some time ago. First a bit of a biology lesson.\n\nWhen you stand up from a sitting position or get up from a position where you are laying down, why don't we black out from blood rushing to our feet?  Gravity should pull fluids downwards, right, and if the brain doesn't get as much blood it doesn't get as much oxygen and it will start shutting down.\n\nThe answer is \"we should\" but the brain knows that and keeps that from happening. Blood vessels constrict and blood pressure shoots up rapidly as you stand up. The brain then keeps tightly regulating this system to make sure it gets that lovely red stuff it needs.\n\nWhen there is an injury that disrupts the normal operations of the brain it starts losing control of this system. Blood rushes away the brain and things that require a lot of energy from the brain, like conscious thought, are the areas that feel the hit the first.\n\n"},
{"title":"ELI5: How does exposure to radioactive substances kill an individual?","question_detail":"After seeing pictures of the Chernobyl incident somewhere on Reddit today, I got to thinking... why do people even die from exposure to radioactive substances anyways?","answer":"Let's limit this to atomic radiation like the stuff given off by Chernobyl and not the blast from a nuclear bomb which vaporizes people from either explosive pressure or thermal energy (heat) or both.\n\nAtomic radiation sources like the ones in Chernobyl give off huge amounts of tiny particles. It's these particles banging into other things that creates heat. Transferring that heat into water transforms it into steam that can be used to drive turbines and generate electricity. That's how nuclear reactors normally work.\n\nNow put a human body in the way. The human body is a very complex thing that requires instructions whenever it has to replace once of its cells (something that occurs everywhere all the time, even when you're done growing). It uses incredibly complex molecules called DNA and RNA, stored in every one of your cells, to hold those instructions.\n\nThe particles in the radiation hit that DNA/RNA instruction manual in your cells and knock it to pieces or at least break parts of it. Your body's instructions are now out of whack and so those cells can't reproduce. Parts of your body that have to build new cells more often, like your hair roots, encounter the broken instructions first and the the replacement cells are not created (and that's why your hair falls out when you have radiation poisoning; it destroys the ability for the roots to grow into more hair). But if the exposure is severe, it's your organs losing their ability to make new cells and shutting down that kills you.\n\nSo you don't get that much of a radiation dose to kill your cells, but enough to scramble some of your DNA/RNA. Some scrambled DNA/RNA in  a cell somewhere in the body loses the part of the instruction manual that tells it when to stop making infinite copies of itself. Those cells start reproducing like mad, taking over everything in the region and maybe even spreading to other areas of the body. That's cancer, and that's why radiation can cause cancer in the long term."},
{"title":"ELI5: Why are expanding bullets (dum-dum) forbidden in international warfare?","question_detail":"It seems very counterintuitive to me. The wounds are bigger than with normal bullets. Isn't that the whole point?\n\nI understand why landmines are forbidden (civilian casualties are bound to happen), but a bullet? Chemical weapons are likely to cause lasting problems to the local population, but stray bullets are... less likely to make a long lasting impact.\n\nHowever we are talking about soldiers killing soldiers. It's preferable to put a knife through someone's belly than kill him with an expanding bullet? I don't get it.\n\n","answer":"There are two tactical effects of expanding bullets. First, more damage to the target. Second, less penetration. \n\nIn warfare, you don't want to kill your target. That guy did nothing wrong, he doesn't deserve to die. So when you shoot him, the goal is to take him (and his buddy, and his medic) out of the fight. If you kill a man, you remove one combatant, and make the rest angry. If you wound a man, you remove three or four combatants, and leave the rest concerned and nervous. \n\nIn warfare, light penetration is not useful, because everyone behind your target is also a target. \n\nCompare law enforcement, hunting, and self defense. If you are shooting at someone in a non-war zone, that person is an immediate threat to those around him, and you need to drop him as soon as possible, so you use expanding rounds that do more damage. \n\nSimilarly, when in public or hunting, your target is only one person or thing, and there is a very real chance that you don't want to shoot the person or thing behind your target, it might be a bystander or your hunting buddy who went to take a piss without telling you. So, you use an expanding round because it has less Penetration and is unlikely to pass through the target and strike something else. "},

{"title":"ELI5: NASA's propellent-less microwave engine.","answer":"It's not NASA's engine, they were just testing it for some guys who claim it works.  Importantly, NASA's test showed that the drive probably *doesn't* work.  It's the media that's misinterpreting NASA's findings to make it sound like the drive works.\n\nNASA tested two drives of the same design, but one of them was intentionally broken.  The expectation was that if the drive works then the non-broken device would produce thrust but the broken one (the \"null device\") would work, but nobody really expected either to produce thrust as the engine design flies in the face of conservation of momentum.  As such, the testing was not tremendously in-depth (6 days of setup, 2 days of testing).\n\nWhat they found, surprisingly, was that the test article *did* produce measurable thrust.  Only barely, but it was definitely non-zero.  This is where the media stopped reading because at this point the drive sounds amazingly interesting.  It's a drive that takes no fuel which can accelerate indefinitely in space.  However, while the media stopped reading, NASA didn't stop writing:  the null device *also* produced thrust.\n\nWhen you look at the experiment they did it involved placing the engine in a vacuum chamber and closing the door then running the engine.  However, they didn't actually pull a vacuum (likely for time or money constraints).  Thus, the minuscule thrust that was measured could have easily come from air currents.  The design of the engine makes it likely that it is heating air on one side more than the other, accounting for the tiny amount of thrust and explaining why both test specimens produced thrust.\n\nAs for the way that the drive is *claimed* to work, it involves bouncing microwave radiation around inside of a chamber that is shaped like a frustrum--that's a cone with the point cut off or a tapered cylinder.  The \"front\" of this chamber is bigger than the \"back\" so it gets more force applied to it.  The paper that derives this force comes up with the proper force for the front and back plates on the chamber, but it neglects to factor in the forces on the side walls.  Without this force accounted for the device would appear to be pushed forward, much like in [this](https://forum.kag2d.com/attachments/tumblr_lbp158unxw1qehfnho1_500-jpg.6746/) design.\n\nThe paper makes extensive use of hand waving and buzz words but it's all smoke and mirrors.  The engine doesn't work and NASA proved it.  Now the media is going crazy trying to pretend that it does because everyone loves the story of the underdog scientist proving the current understanding of science wrong."},
{"title":"ELI5: What is this NASA engine I'm hearing so much about and why will/won't it work?","answer":"The applications would be infinite, sadly, such claims are at the very least disputable. The paper claims the engine can create forward thrust in an entirely enclosed space without any kind of matter escaping the engine. This violates the laws of physics as we know it, mainly the conservation of momentum. It's very likely that this is simply a glitch in measurement, and it's simply a particularly weak version of the ion drive. "},

{"title":"ELI5: Where does southern hospitality come from?","answer":"The North and the South developed quite differently. All generalizations, but - The North was heavily industrialized, crowded and generally less wealthy. The majority of immigrants arriving to America were doing so through New York and other places on the northeast coast; having little to no money, they would frequently try to find jobs and start making money right away, settling where they were. You note that the culture in that region is rushed, industrialized, task-driven; I think this plays a large role in why.\n\n As for the South, its primary money-maker was agriculture - tobacco, cotton, etc, etc. Plantations were large and sprawling, more people had more wealth compared to the North, and everyone ran on \"farm time.\" As a result, the pace was slower - and, being in larger land with less movement than NYC, for example, everyone depended a little more on each other. In the North, there was always someone else you could turn to if you needed something - if a relationship burned out, someone new was right there with the same things. In the South, not so much. So you would maintain a good relationship with Mr. Sims - he has the best access to X or Y, whereas Mr. James has access to Q and Z.\n\nMaintaining good relationships in that era meant a lot of hospitality, events, making a to-do of people coming over. It means saying nice things (even if you didn't mean them), and being relationship-driven (rather than task driven, like the North). Even as things began to change away from the Plantation/farm setup, this cultural mindset stayed on. To a Northerner, things in the South seem slow and overly personal. To a Southerner, things in the North seem rushed and cold. It comes down to how they were colonized and the things that they value. Neither one is Better or Right or Wrong - they're just different."},

{"title":"ELI5: What is ISIS? What are their goals?","answer":"ISIS is the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. They more recently have been known as ISIL/the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and now just IS/the Islamic State. In the past they were known as JTJ/Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad (I think it means something like \"Group for Unity [of God] and Jihad\"), Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn (which means Al-Qaeda in Iraq/Mesopotamia, basically) and the Islamic State of Iraq.\n\nThey are an extremist Islamic terrorist/militia group. They believe that they hold religious authority (and therefore legal authority, as in fundamentalist Islam the two are linked) over the entire Muslim world. They believe that much of the Muslim world is impure and must be purged of false leaders and false believers. They aim to establish a unified global caliphate under their control. A global caliphate essentially puts the entire world under control of a theocratic government as either believers in Islam, or subjects permitted to exist among them. \n\nThey seek a return to the roots of Islam and believe that many developments and branches of Islam, going back to the Ottomans and earlier caliphates, are heresy. This is an extreme branch of Salafism, which broadly considers early Islam to be the true Islam and favors a literal interpretation and epitomizes the first few generations of practitioners. Salafism is also related to Wahhabism, and some use the terms interchangeably, and you may hear ISIS referred to as either or both. Wahhabists are generally more radical than many Salafists.\n\nThey are Sunni and violently oppose Shia Muslims (I don't know enough of the difference between the two to tell you), as well as Sunnis that they believe are apostates. As an example, they believe that many other Sunni jihadist groups, like Hamas, Hezbollah, and Al-Qaeda are apostates and fight against them.\n\nSo far they have been fighting to seize territory in Iraq and Syria, establish sharia law, and govern the areas they control. They also claim the entire Middle East and northern Africa, as well as Spain, Portugal, former Yugoslavia, India, Pakistan, and parts of western China. "},

What kind of danger does this pose to surface structures in the event of an earthquake or has anyone done research on this?","answer":"I'm not sure that's the right answer. I seen the slurry flowing out of wells being fracked and been told that the shiny black grains of rock that flowed up were the target zone material. These rocks grains were no bigger than a piece of rice and these wells extend out radially in various directions. Here in TX there is a decent well location resource available from the TRCC and if you check it out you'll see the amazing number of wells and their proximity to each other. Where one well begins another has ended. \nAdditionally there is the length of the horizontal component of the wells. Sometimes they extend for a couple of miles horizontally from the vertical bore. Your house might be on top of a well that is unknown and unseen to you.\nAlso between the lubrication of the deep oil and injection of water treated with fracking fluids including diesels/kerosene and the injection of sand or polystyrene beads to prop open the interstitial spaces-well I just see that as a geophysical nightmare.\nMaybe I'm wrong.\n\nAlso there are plenty of cases where the older shallow wells caused sinkholes to open. This has occurred especially in areas with salt dome geostructures. This has happened at distances from the original well bore.\n\nI could see the analogy working with one hole and a shortened horizontal component.\n\nI'm a total geo noob but I enjoy reading about the subject.

{"title":"Eli5: When a house gets completely burned down, how can experts figure out where the fire originated?","answer":"Firefighter here who has just completed some fire investigation coursework for school. I would like to clarify that Fire Inspectors and Fire Investigators are two different jobs (though in some smaller organizations it may be the same individual performing both jobs.) An inspector's job is to inspect occupancies periodically to ensure that fire safety and life safety codes are being met. An investigator's job is to determine cause, the topic of OP's question. Like any investigation, there are clues that can give you an idea of what happened. Understanding burn patterns and interviewing witnesses and responding firefighters can help point you to the area of origin. Say, for instance, the area of origin is in a room with an outlet that you're concerned about. If the fire had started inside the outlet it would appear burned from the inside out. However, if the outlet was exposed to flames from the exterior the burn damage would appear different. There is a whole field of study dedicated to this topic, far beyond what I can go into here, but in short a house that burns until it collapses may appear like a meaningless pile of rubble to the untrained eye, but there is still a wealth of knowledge to be gained from examining the remains."},

Seems like complete overkill to me. ","answer":"This board has many channels. Each channel is essentially similar: a sound comes in, is modified, and is combined into a mix. There may be sub mixes that can be modified as a group and then combined into the final output sound.\n\nFor the boards on the left of the shot, from bottom to top: Slider is for volume, a mute button, bottom 4-6 knobs for adding sound effects like distortion, 4-6 knobs for tone adjustments/EQ (bass, mid range, sibilance),  4-6 knobs for sending that channel to a submix, maybe a button for adding phantom power to a mic, a knob for pre-EQ gain (just another volume, but applied before effects and EQ). Depending on the complexity of the board there could be even more buttons for each channel, but these are very common.\n\nFor the boards on the right, one of them is probably a multi channel compressor. A compressor makes the volume non-linear, at a certain volume, increases in volume become attenuated. If the input sound becomes twice as loud, the output may become twice as loud, but if the input becomes 4x louder, it may be compressed back to only 3x louder. This decreases the dynamic range of the sound, compressing the volume changes into a smaller space. This is good for a sound being played on a speaker, but the exact opposite of what is achieved by a live symphony.\n\nAnother board on the right is probably an extremely precise EQ. Each channel on the left board may have 4-6 knobs for EQ, but the precise one may have 20. This allows tight frequency ranges to be modified for an individual channel, or for the entire mix depending. An example would be to boost the attack sound of a drum, which may be specifically at 5.5kHz, without boosting the 200Hz-1kHz range, so that it does not interfere with the vocals. Each instrument has its own \"sound ranges\" that it occupies, and EQ's allow the instruments to fit better together like having lanes on a highway."},

While looking from the darker side you get transparency. \n\nBut my question is .... why? What's really going on? Is something different happening when you only see a reflection, versus when you only see blackness? Is it different types of glass? Help me understand!","answer":"I'm going to use some arbitrary unit of light, called \"things\". Now let's define how much light a window might reflect vs. let through. Since windows are pretty transparent, we'll say 5% of light is reflected, 95% gets through.\n\nIf you're outside at night, looking into a lit room through a window, you can see into the room clearly. Maybe the moon and stars together are generating 100 things of light, but the lamps inside the room are generating 10,000 things. When we look at the window, an image of outside is being reflected back to us at a brightness of 5 things, but we're also seeing inside the room at a brightness of 9,500 things, so that's what we see clearly.\n\nNow if we were inside the lit room, looking outside, the outside is coming in to us at 95 things, but the inside of the room is being reflected back to us at 500 things, so it's that reflection that we see most clearly.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that if we're inside the lit room, our eyes are adjusted to brightness, so taking in much less light. That's why the person outside at night might be able to see fairly well, but if we're inside the bright room and look outside, we just see complete darkness."},

Now each one of those cells, they've got something like 100 trillion atoms. \n\nI can't really explain how it works, I don't think anyone can explain consciousness quite yet - but basically, when you bring together this massive stupidly huge amount of moving parts, things become possible that weren't before. \n\nYou've got 10 atoms - What can you do with those? Basically nothing. But if you have 1 octillion atoms - 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 - And you arrange them in a certain way, you somehow get us. \n\nHow they get arranged so perfectly? You answered it yourself. Single cell organisms that are capable of copying themselves mostly perfectly through DNA. Errors(mutations) are either beneficial or harmful, and increase or decrease its chance of survival. If it's increased then it's more likely it will make copies of itself and pass on the mutation. Vice versa if its harmful.

And the very short answer to that is: no way, no how. You would need to apply an infinite amount of force and transfer an infinite amount of energy into the pole just to get it to perceptibly move, because at a radius of half a lightyear, you really wouldn't need to rotate the pole very much at all to get the ends up to relativistic velocities.\n\nAccelerating any object requires energy. The faster you want it to go, the more energy you have to put in, Not to mention overcoming the inertia of all that mass.\n\nSo, basically? Congratulations, you've got your magic lightyear pole.

{"title":"ELI5: Why do people throughout history resort to violence when they disagree?","question_detail":"It's been something that's happened since the beginning of mankind, and it still happens today, from two people throwing a few punches to bloody religious wars.\n\nIs there something in the human mind that triggers this instinct? Do people simply see it as the easiest option to eradicate the other opinion or belief? What makes violence such a frequent \"solution\" to disagreements?","answer":"Violence is the ultimate step in problem solving, and it's normally 100% effective.  Violence is terrible, and violence results in death, pain and suffering, but violence remains the pragmatic solution when the alternative to a fight/war is worse than the war itself.  Since war is so painful, it's often in the interests of both parties to come to a compromise. Or, to use the threat of violence as a more painful alternative to a one-sided compromise.\n\nFor example: You're a pacifist who objects to fighting, and I'm going to punch you in the face unless you provide me your lunch money.  Barring external options like the police, you can either give your 1)lunch money, 2)get punched in the face, or 3)offer a compromise.  \n1- You give up your lunch money.  You've made a value judgement that your lunch money is less important than maintaining your principles of not fighting.\n\n2a- You don't give up your lunch money, and get punched in the face after you decide not to fight. (\"Ow, goddamnit, that fucking hurt!\")  You continue to get punched until that pain becomes more important than your pacifist principles, or more important than your lunch money.  It's possible the bully gets bored, but more likely they simply take what they want, without your agreement.  \n(This is the Not-Fighting Option. In my example, it ends with the worst of all possibilities, you're now punched AND have no lunch money. This seems like a rather poor choice.)\n\n2b- You don't give up your lunch money, and rather than get punched, you fight. If the bully is far larger, faster and more dangerous than you, the less attractive fighting looks and the more attractive appeasement looks.  See Option 1.\n\n3- Compromise, perhaps there's some common ground?  \n3a - Lower the perceived Reward. Perhaps you try to convince the bully that there *is* no lunch money, and they'll decide whether the now lesser reward of the possible lunch money is worth the definite risk of punching/fighting.  Or, that there's enough lunch money for two, and that there's no additional reward for taking it, because you're sharing anyway. \n\n3b - Increase their perceived risk. Perhaps you've been training in martial arts and lifting weights, you explain this to the bully to convince him that fighting will be more costly to them.  They'll then make a value judgement of whether risking a fight is the work the possibility of getting your lunch money.\n\nFor all of Option 3 Compromises, they'll make a new value judgement based on their perception of risk/reward.\n\nEverything stems from the first person who says, I Want or Need that thing someone else owns.  Perhaps that desire is morally justifiable, they need food, water, shelter, medicine. Perhaps that desire is morally unjustifiable.  Perhaps If you wish to reduce conflict, reduce peoples' desires and wants to what they already have.  If someone does decide that their best course of action is to fight you, you're deciding between multiple shitty courses of action, and finding the one that is least harmful to you.  Giving up your lunch money sucks, getting punched sucks, and fighting sucks, but it just might be the best option.  If you have pacifist principles that persist beyond getting punched once, you're a better person than I am.\n"},

If you're convicted of a crime then you serve whatever sentence that is appropriate for the crime; if you're convicted of multiple crimes then you can be sentenced to multiple sentences.\n\nFor example, and I'm *totally* making up these sentences:\n\n* 5 years for robbery of a house on 3 Smith St.\n* 7 years for armed robbery of a business on 9 Smith St.\n* 2 years for impersonating a police officer\n* 3 years for shooting your neighbor's kitten -- I just made myself sad :(\n\nYour sentence would be 5 + 7 + 2 + 3 = 17 years.\n\nIf you're convicted of worse stuff:\n\n* 80 years for killing your neighbor\n* 30 years for arson\n* 90 years for blowing up a Post Office\n\nThen your sentence would be 80 + 30 + 90 = whatever years.\n\nIf you did both sets then it would be 5 + 7 + 2 + 3 + 80 + 30 + 90 = whatever years.\n\nYou can't be like:\n\n&gt; I know the sentence for this crime is X years, but X years is more years than I expect the criminal to live, therefore I would like the sentence for that crime to be something different than what it is (like \"life).\n\nAlso, sometimes sentences run concurrently. This means that you can be serving multiple sentences at one. To go back to the first list of crimes:\n\n* Year 1-2 you're serving for both robberies, the impersonation, and the kitten-killing\n* Year 2-3 you're serving for both robberies, and the kitten-killing\n* Year 3-7 you're serving for both robberies\n* Year 5-7 you're serving for armed robbery\n* Year 7 you're free\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: Why is it that even though I listen to music at the same volume every day, some days it sounds louder or softer than normal?","answer":"I can think of several reasons. \n\nEach song could have been recorded at different volumes, so even though your volume is the same, each song isn't, like how ads on TV are recorded louder than shows. Some music players have an option to normalize volume between songs. \n\nYou might also hear treble or bass better than the other, so if each song has different amounts of treble/bass (depending on instruments, voices, notes), you could perceive it as a volume difference. Treble always sounds louder (and jarring!) to me than bass, so  I use an equalizer to even it out.\n\nIf you're more tired/sleepy that day, sounds may seem louder. This is me in the morning!\n\n\nIf you're using a laptop and listening to music in the kitchen one day, living room the next, bedroom, etc, that would also affect perceived volume. Kitchens/bathrooms tend to be louder because of tile floors, metal appliances, ceramics, while bedrooms and living rooms would sound quieter because of carpet, couches, curtains, etc. \n\nDoes this help?

New methodologies like agile are often used to bamboozle managers not familiar with them into letting developers get away with this."},
{"title":"ELI5: How ciliary muscles control accommodation in the eye","answer":"The lense is suspended via the ciliary zonules, which pull on the lense, causing it to flatten. The refractive power of the lense decreases and objects in the distance appear sharp. This is the relaxed position.  \nThe other ends of the zonules attach to the ciliar muscle. This muscle is ring-shaped and surrounds the lense. When it contracts, its diameter decreases and the ciliary zonules are relaxed. Through elasticity the lense takes a more spherical shape and thereby focuses things that are closer to us.  \nWith age, the elasticity of the lense decreases and it gets worse at returning into a spherical shape. This is the cause for presbyopia."},

Best guess is that there is some kind of uneasy truce in play at the moment.\n\nThe JRTN is the armed wing of the Baathist loyalist movement in Iraq. It is composed of Sunni Iraqis from tribal and religious groups favoured under Saddam Hussain but which are now out-of-favour under the new Shia government (although the Baathists are  Unlike IS (which is mostly made up of foreign fighters), JRTN has very strong, deeply embedded links with the Sunni Iraqi community.\n\nCapitalizing on Sunni discontent with the government is a key part of its strategy - the less capable the government is, the more attractive JRTN become. Infiltrating and sabotaging the Iraqi government and military is a key element of this strategy.\n\nIt's not unfair to speculate that the Baathists provided information and support to IS in order to destabilize the Iraqi government - essentially, it's an attempted coup on their part, with IS as the weapon. Presumably they'll now seek to capitalize on discontent with IS, presenting themselves as a native, home-grown alternative to the fanatical, violent foreigners of IS. End result is that the local community is fully behind the Baathists.\n\nAlthough the Baathist government was secular(ish), it did build its power base on exploiting religious and tribal divisions within Iraq. Anti-Shia sectarianism was, and remains, a big part of that."},

It triggers the TRPV1 Vanilloid receptor in your mucous membranes, which sends a signal to your brain that you are experiencing a noxious stimuli. Normally this receptor responds to heat, and because of this, the type of signal it sends results in a sensation of heat to the brain. "},

{"title":"ELI5: How do multiple dimensions in something like String Theory give rises to other forces like elctromagnetism and the strong nuclear force?","question_detail":"I've always wondered this.  The more I've learned about relativity and gravity, the more I understand how you can picture our three dimensions as curved and objects moving in a straight line continue to move in straight lines, just not according to our three spatial dimensions, which get bent and look like from our perspective they are actually straight.  How can this intuition be extended to the other fundamental forces arising out of multiple dimensions?","answer":"Gravity doesn't *arise* out of there (potentially) being dimensions beyond the four we know. For other reasons, some theories like String theory propose there being extra dimensions, and one of the appeals of those theories is that gravity could \"leak\" into those other dimensions. The other forces of nature are trillions and trillions and trillions of times more powerful than gravity and we don't really know why, so it's possible that gravity is just as strong but we can't measure it since most of its force is acting in a dimension we can't measure.\n\nThe other forces make perfectly good sense (relatively speaking) in four dimensions.

It's occurs the entire time the plane is at or exceeds the speed of sound. You only hear one boom as it only passes you once. The only difference between the boom at the speed of sound and exceeding the speed of sound is where the boom is in relation to the plane.

{"title":"ELI5: What is the difference between running on a treadmill and running on land?","answer":"For me if I run on a treadmill the terrain is stable and my body gets to repeat movements.  The treadmill is inside and protected from the weather.  The air is filtered through air conditioning, but there is still a degree of mustiness and the sounds are of people in a gymnasium.  Often also there are songs I dislike.  The treadmill itself offers some cushioning for my joints, and there is monitoring equipment so I can increase my speed, and measure the distance I run.\n\nRunning on land this time of year I smell jasmine and gum trees; I hear galahs and magpies.  The ground surface changes all the time so my brain  and body guesses where my feet should land, and at what angle.  The sensation of each footfall changes according to whether I am running on bitumen, grass, or dead leaves and soil.  Where I live I have no garden, and running through parkland gives me exposure to natural sunlight and vitamin D, fresh air, and a sense of a world bigger than offices and bars.  I catch glimpses of spiders, and insects, and birds, and possums, and other living creatures.  Animals living a very different existence to mine, whose shared existence becomes a real part of my day as I run alongside.  Running in the morning I can start in the dark and watch the sun rise over water.  Most runners who approach me from the other direction smile, and there is a fleeting connection, an expression of camaraderie.  If it is raining or hot or cold or humid or anything at all other than cool and mild my sense of achievement soars.

{"title":"ELI5: How does a presidential motorcade work?","question_detail":"What are the logistics, strategy and technology involved?","answer":"Based on various documentaries there is a lot of preplanning involved. Generally, where ever the President is expected to go will be surveyed by agents weeks in advance. They will determine various routes and back-up routes for the motorcade. They will also sweep the various routes looking for potential hazards such as bombs or locations that would be ideal for a would-be assassin.\n\nWhen the motorcade moves, the road along the route will be blocked off to traffic. Police officers will often be stationed at intersections to prevent people from accidentally entering the motorcade route. In high pedestrian areas, sometimes fences will be put up along the side walk to keep pedestrians off the street, along with additional officers.\n\nEven on highways, the road will be cleared in the direction the President is moving. Based on several videos I've seen, a police car will be placed at the highway entrances to block traffic, and they will allow traffic to resume behind the motorcade shortly after it has passed.\n\nThe motorcade itself seem composed of two sections. The first is composed on the President and his protection, the second is usually support staff and press vehicles. Its setup so that the first section can quickly and effectively split off in the event of an emergency.\n\nThe President almost always as two vehicles. Usually these are a pair of armored Cadillac collectively known as \"The Beast\". Much of The Beast is classified, but its generally known that the vehicles are armored with thick Kevlar armor that are used on war ships. The windows don't roll down (except maybe the driver's a little for toll booths supposedly), the wheels are capable of operating for a limited distance if shot out, the gas tank is protected, the cabin is air tight, obviously the windows are bullet proof, and the engine is overpowered. The Beast's proportions make it appear smaller than it actually is. While from a distance and from video and photos it looks like a standard stretched limo, the frame is actually based on what are used for pickup trucks, so it is as tall as an adult.\n\nThere are several SUVs filled with agents and weapons that closely follow the The Beast. There is also a vehicle that can jam cellphone signals. A mobile blood bank and an ambulance also travel with the motorcade. The motorcade is often preceded by a motorcycle escort. At the back are usually the second section of the motorcade, with all the support staff and press.\n\nOne of the main ideas with the motorcade is to always stay moving. The motorcade does not stop until its reaches the destination usually. The President will usually enter and leave The Beast from inside the building or inside of a tent to protect from snipers. \n\nAt the location the President will be in when not in the motorcade, there are various counter snipers and rapid response teams who are near by and looking for threats. There are likely also teams along the motorcade route in the more dangerous areas.\n\nThere was one case where (I think HW Bush) was overseas and the motorcade involved some half a dozen decoy Beast that would constantly shuffle around to throw off would be attackers. When the President landed, he didn't arrive on the classic Air Force One jumbo jet, but a small, unmarked plane in a separate part of the airport. When at the [outdoor] event he was attended, there were protest near by that was turning violent. A rapid response team was hiding on stage, feet from the President, full assault rifles at the ready, in case they need to provide extra protection."},

{"title":"ELI5: What is fire, and why are some materials flammable and others are not?","answer":"Fire is the product of an exothermic reaction between a flammable material and oxygen.\n\nWhen someone refers to an item burning or combusting, it really entails that there is a chemical reaction taking place; the material in question is oxidizing. This reaction is exothermic, that is, it gives off excess energy into the ambient environment in the form of heat. This is why a lighter will not light low oxygen conditions. \n\nDifferent materials have varying propensities to react in this way. For example: gasoline. The chemical makeup of gasoline is such that it very readily reacts with oxygen, and therefore does so very quickly. A wooden stick, on the other hand, does not AS READILY react with oxygen as gasoline, which is why it burns more slowly. \n\nWhat we see, the orange flickering part, is the heat from this reaction causing unburned gasses, or in the case of, say, wood, soot glowing orange hot. When there is complete combustion, that is, all of the material is oxidizing, the flame is blue. \n\nSome materials react with oxygen in a different manner. Take, for example, iron. It's oxidizing reaction takes place over a long period of time and forms rust, Fe2O3. \n\nIf you'd like, I can continue on about why the flame takes on the shape it does, why gasses burn more quickly than solids (for the most part), or why some flames are much hotter than others.  \n\n "},
{"title":"ELI5: How do semiconductors and as a result transistors work?","question_detail":"Trying to understand how this works but all the websites I've visited assume a prior knowledge or aren't really that accessible","answer":"Semis aren't totally impossible to understand.    No math or quantum mechanics required, as long as you don't need to design actual devices.\n\nFirst, several misconceptions stand in our way.  These misconceptions are commonly taught in grade-school, so nearly everyone has 'em.   When your brain is blocked by prior concepts which are wrong, everything seems far more complicated than it really is.   It's all like a simple puzzle, but being viewed through distorting eyeglasses.\n\nSo dump the misconceptions:  conductors aren't \"transparent\" to electric charges, they aren't like empty pipes.  Instead, a conductor is a material where the atoms don't remain neutral, and where electric charged-particles are movable.  From Ohm's Law, if you apply an e-field to a conductor, the conductors own charges will begin drifting.  The conductor itself is the only source of flowing electricity.  (So conductors are like storage tanks which are always full of movable liquid molecules!)  In metals, the mobile charges are the atoms' own electrons.  But this isn't a solid rule.  Things are different in salt-water, acid solution, plasmas, and semiconductors.  Beware, don't fall into the mental trap of believing that electric current always equals electron-flow.\n\nSecond, semiconductors aren't resistors, they're not partially or \"semi\" conductive.  Lots of books say so, but they're just plain wrong.  Instead, semiconductors are insulators, but where only a small amount of energy is needed to knock an electron loose from an atom.  High temperatures can do this, can turn them into metal-like conductors.  But oddly enough, the presence of contamination can also do it.  Just one in a million of impurity atoms can free up some charges.  Materials with movable charges are conductive.  A small bit of impurity can turn nonconducting silicon or germanium into a fair conductor.\n\nSemiconductors in nature are heavily contaminated and conductive.  To make electronics, first the material must be turned into insulator: purified to far better than 99.9999% pure.\n\nNext, the movable charges inside impure semiconductors are WEIRD.  There are two types: N-type, where the electrons have broken loose from their impurity atom and are wandering around.  N-type semiconductors are a bit like metal, but with far fewer wandering electrons.\n\nThere are also P-type, where an impurity-atom creates a location in the crystalline lattice where one electron is missing  ...and where an electron from a neighboring atom can easily fall into this vacancy.  When an electron falls in, the impurity atom turns negative.  But neighboring atom becomes a positive ion.  The neighbor had been neutral, but now it lost one electron.  And the same can happen again: an electron from a *different* neighbor can fall into the new positive ion, making it neutral, but now the different neighbor is missing an electron and is charged positive.  So it seems as if a positive ion (or an entire proton) is now wandering around the crystal lattice.   It's genuinely positive, yet the only thing moving are the electrons.  Thermal vibrations keep the process going, and the location of the positive ion wanders randomly, like water molecule in a liquid.\n\nNot too hard to visualize the P-type: it's like an Abacus, a row of wooden beads on a rod, but with one bead missing.  The beads are electrons on the semiconductor atoms.  They keep the atoms neutral-charged.  You can move the vacant space around by moving the beads one at a time.  (You can't move entire columns of beads, that would take more force than the heat-vibrations provide.)  And, the movable empty space is a positive charge, since it \"exposes\" one proton on an atom's nucleus which would otherwise be neutral if it wasn't missing one electron.   The extra protons seem to wander from place to place.  Yet  ...not.\n\nFinally, note that the N-type and P-type semiconductors *don't* have any overall electric charges.   The N-type has wandering electrons yes, but it also has an equal number of impurity atoms which are immobile positive ions (since those impurity atoms each let their outer electron wander off.)  So, the N-type is like a sparse grid of positive charges which is soaked in a liquid made of movable negatives.   And the P-type is the same but opposite: a sparse grid of negative ions (the impurity atoms,) soaked with a fluid made of mobile positive charges.\n\nFinally (really finally,) note that \"semiconductor action\" only happens when the impurity level is really quite low, but not zero.  A \"large\" doping in semiconductor manufacture might be only one impurity atom per ten thousand semiconductor atoms.   Compare this with copper, where every single atom donates a movable particle to the \"sea of charge\" within the conductor.   If copper contains a dense and incompressible fluid made of electrons, then semiconductors contain a compressible gas.   And where electric currents in copper may take hours to travel a fraction of an inch, in semiconductors the charge-flows are tens of thousands of times faster.\n\nThe small amount of wandering charges, the \"density of charge-carriers\" being low, that's the entire key to semiconductor effects.  In metals, the movable charges are not \"compressible,\" it would take megavolts to sweep all the mobile electrons out of a copper membrane and convert it to insulator.    But doped semiconductors have a million times fewer mobile charges.  They're \"compressible,\" and it only takes a few volts to electrically squeeze the mobile carriers out of a small patch of semiconductor.   Yes, all conductors can be turned into insulators by removing all their mobile charges.  But only with semiconductors is this practical.\n\nFET transistors: like pinching a tube shut from the side.    Bipolar transistors: like an ultra-thin insulator with variable thickness, variable conductivity.\n\nAlso go and search out my article called: transistors alternate viewpoint.\n\n**tldr;** if metal are like water tanks, then semiconductors are like balloons: full of easily compressible electricity-gas.\n\n"},

Too much of the \"taking\" and not enough of the \"giving\" is the problem we would like to solve."},
{"title":"ELI5: Why is everyone so up in arms about the NFL coming down on Adrian Peterson?","question_detail":"I don't quite follow why there are numerous articles, public outrage, and bold claims being made about the commissioner.  To me, he committed a crime and should (will) be punished for it.  What is the big deal?\n\nThank you!","answer":"Some of the controversy I have seen centers around the the issue of corporal punishment of children and whether it is acceptable.\n\nA lot of people still practice it and see it as a good thing. Some of this sentiment is based on the Biblical Proverbs 13:24, \"Whoever spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is diligent to discipline him\" (ESV). So, many people still literally believe that you must physically discipline your child if you love him or her, and therefore what Peterson did is fine, and should not be punished.\n\nI personally don't agree with that view at all, but I think it may help explain why this is such an issue to many people."},

Being wealthy above all isn't about buying nice things and drinking tequila with beautiful ladies on top of your yacht. It is about doing whatever you want, whenever you want. You don't have to worry about bills and how to fill your fridge. \n\nAt the end of the day you also don't have to worry how to pay the mortgage when you lose your partner who also has a job or even how to pay a lawyer. I think this spirit extends through the whole lifestyle and way of thinking of a rich/famous person.\n\nIt is also a matter of subjective perception, there are always people that get divorced but by turning the TV on you immidiately get access to selected scandals and private information of different people.

Often they don't have a lots of clients, just because consulting work usually takes some in-depth study of the clients situation and they wouldn't have time to handle a lot of them simultaneously, and also because the more clients you have the more likely conflicts of interest are to arise."},

{"title":"ELI5: The stature of limitations. If a crime is a crime, why is there a time limit?","answer":"The purpose and effect of statutes of limitations is to protect defendants. There are three reasons supporting the existence of statutes of limitations, namely: (a) a plaintiff with good causes of actions should pursue them with reasonable diligence; (b) a defendant might have lost evidence to disprove a stale claim; and (c) long dormant claims have more cruelty than justice in them (Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th edition). The general rule is the limitation period begins when the plaintiff’s cause of action accrues or is made to be aware of the injury that might have happened a long time ago (e.g., asbestos injury).\n\nDirect Wikipedia quote..."},
{"title":"ELI5:Why are Tyler Perry movies popular?","answer":"Most mainstream movies don't feature much black culture, and when they do, it is rappers and pimps and gang members, not regular working people.\n\nThat's what Tyler Perry is providing, movings about regular working class black people for regular working class black people.  They might be terrible and formulaic, but people like to see movies about themselves, and for a large audience, there aren't many alternatives.\n\nThere was a a similar movement in the 1970s, called Blaxploitation, where cheesy, low budget, and almost universally bad action movies target towards black audiences saw a good deal of success."},
{"title":"ELI5: Why is music a universally pleasurable experience? In what part of our psyche does rythym and melody cause a soothing connection?","answer":"Lots of speculation.\n\nSteven Pinker is my favourite evolutionary psych go to guy. He is of the opinion that music is not one stand alone thing that people enjoy, rather it is a conglomeration of different things that we enjoy, the sum of which hyper-stimulates us in a way that each of the individual stimuli would not. \n\nSo for example, Pinker believes that we have an innate appreciation of rhythm, this is the case for an appreciation of time, or even spaces in time. The natural geometry of our bodies evolved in a way which creates rhythm. For example our limbs are natural pendulums, walking requires sophisticated co-ordination, the rhythm of which babies take a while to learn. More complex activities require a more complex co-ordination of rhythm.\n\nWe have an innate ability to recognise patterns. The evolutionary advantage of this need not be said. Our pattern recognition pervades all areas of society, arts and culture, economics, politics and pursuit of knowledge. Music holds many patterns. The same ability to appreciate patterns may be what led to mathematics, which many have commented to bear lots of similarities with music.\n\nWe also have an appreciation of tones which is necessary for speech and generally differentiating sounds in our environment. Our ears have evolved to appreciate certain tones such pure tones.\n\nHe lists other examples I can't remember. But you get the gist, we created music because we find it pleasurable, it happens to stimulate a lot of faculties which we find innately pleasurable. "},

{"title":"ELI5: What is photoconductivity? and does it have something to do with the invention of the television?","answer":"Photoconductivity is a phenomenon mostly occurring in compounds or elements known as semiconductors, like silicon or gallium arsenide.\n\nWhat is happening is this. These materials have a \"band gap\" that is to say there is a gap in the kinetic energy (how fast they go) that electrons are allowed to have.\n\nThere are two bands usually talked about here, the valence band and the conduction band. The valence band is low energy (slower) and it's full of electrons so electrons in there so they aren't very mobile. The conduction band is higher energy (faster) and there are a lot of empty places (or states as scientists like to call them, it has a broader meaning than just place though) for these electrons to go. As a result these electrons can move fairly easily.\n\nIf you shine light that is \"blue enough\" (high enough energy) then the electrons in the valence band will absorb this light and jump across the band gap. Because there are lots of empty spaces the more electrons you have in the conduction band the more conductive the material is. As a result shining the right color of light on a semiconductor increases its conductivity, this phenomenon is known as photoconductivity.\n\nThose electrons don't stay up there for long though. Eventually they donate their energy to heat and fall back down, sometimes they can fall back in such a way to emit light (like a glow sticker). Whether or not it emits light back depends on the material, and the speed at which the electrons fall also depends on the material. In stuff that glows, electrons fall back slowly. \n\nAs far as televisions go, it does indeed have to do with the invention of it, although not directly. A cathode ray tube tv, the old style ones. Have electron guns which shoot electrons at a phosphor (medium speed glowing material, glows for maybe a couple microseconds). The electrons from the gun give energy to the electrons in the phosphor which make it glow and thus with enough engineering and precision you can make a tv.\n\nI hope this is ELI5 enough. Semiconductors are a complicated science and it can take many years of learning to fully understand it.\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: Why do I shake my legs while sitting down?

But there are 4 reasons for that. \n\n1) In Winter people travel less. This means that demand goes down and gas gets cheaper. \n\n2) In Winter the US government subsidizes heating oil production. This is done at the level of crude oil and thus makes producing gas cheaper since it is also made from crude oil. \n\n3) The US produced far more oil than anticipated from fracking and our other sources.

A Sheriff's office usually covers the law enforcement needs for a county (or another geographical area as determined by local law makers).\n\nA police department is put together under the authority of a city and that city's leaders. The Police Chief is a hired position that reports to the mayor (or whatever leadership structure is present). Police offices cover law enforcement only within that city."},
{"title":"[ELI5] Why are some states able to legalize marijuana use when it's still a federal offense? Also, why hasn't the US government done anything about it?","question_detail":"I find it odd that the federal government has done basically nothing about the flaunting of drug laws in some states.","answer":"1. States rights. Also marijuana prohibition falling apart is really a lot more about centralised government falling apart. You know all that stuff in the book 1984? Well it turns out it is a hell of a lot harder for Big Brother to control anything than they tell ya. \n\nThe British couldn't control America from acrossed a vast ocean so too our government can't control us form acrossed a vast ocean of technology. \n\n2. Screwing with states rights is political suicide. \n\nMarijuana reform is actually a symptom of the greater change at hand. \n\nNotice how the government and news outlets are sounding more and more behind the times or out of touch? fewer people than ever get there news from TV anymore. They use to say \"You can't fight someone who buys ink buy the barrel\". Well now we don't use ink or paper. So Rosebud has lost that race. \n\nThis is what has happened many times before in history but this time the theme isn't nomads becoming farmers with the advent of the plow or industrial growth and jobs for all, it's networking and problem solving without the aid of Uncle Sam or a paycheck and health benefits from a corporation. \n\nPeople are not looking for a figurehead to tell them what to do anymore. There just going out and doing it because now for the first time in human history all the right technologies are coming together to allow us to create our own life. We can 3D print our own truth. One that is far more democratized and locally relevant. \n\nMarijuana prohibition is just another pillar of the old system falling away in decay. "},

I've also read reviews where powerbanks with even higher capacities like 50,000mAh do not provide as much power as name brand 20,000mAh batteries, what gives?","answer":"Because you're not comparing the actual energy stored in the batteries. The specs says that device has 6 3500 mAh batteries. Lithium polymer cells have a nominal voltage of 3.7 V, this yields 77.7 Wh of energy. \n\nLaptop batteries have a nominal voltage of anywhere between 10 V and 20 V. At 10 V and a capacity of 4.6 Ah, that yields 46 Wh of energy. You could charge this laptop once and have some energy left over. Of course you also have to take into account that the voltage conversion circuits are not 100% efficient, but high quality ones can reach into &gt;85% efficiency."},

{"title":"ELI5:If you eat a variety of foods in one sitting, does that have any affect on how your body absorbs the nutrients?","question_detail":"Sometimes I like to go around the kitchen and eat a combination of smaller foods, rather than make a meal. For instance, I might eat half an apple, peanuts, a stick of cheese, raisins, blueberries, potato chips, maybe a pickle or a yogurt, then drink some milk ( or a v8 just for shits and giggles). But would it be better to eat those foods at different times so that the body can fully absorb the nutrients, or does it not matter if you eat everything at once? Also what if I ate all that food and washed it down with a soda or beer? Would that \"ruin\" the nutritional value or would my body take it in all the same?","answer":"Well, if you eat a massive quantity of fat, your body might not be able to produce enough bile to digest it, and the other things you're eating might not be absorbed as well. And there are effects where eating something with Vitamin D will help you absorb more calcium from milk.\n\nBut generally speaking, these effects are pretty minor. Drinking a soda with your salad will not somehow prevent all the nutrients in the salad from getting to your tissues, in the same way that eating a salad will not magically \"balance\" eating a bunch of junk food.\n\nIt's important not to eat too much at a time, so that you can manage your hunger evenly throughout the day, and the type of food you're eating is obviously important to your health. But, as far as I know, what food you consume together and the order that you eat it doesn't matter very much in the broad scheme of things."},

And, frankly, they had it first. \n\nAlso, historically, \"Washington City\" and the \"District of Columbia\" were not the same thing, as there were multiple incorporated cities within the District. It was only after the Civil War, when Alexandria was ceded back to Virginia and the rest of the District was consolidated under one municipal government, that \"Washington\" and \"DC\" became synonymous.

I have towed a 1,200ft ship on a 130ft tug that was only 6,000hp. Ship can't maneuvering tight spaces because of there length.

{"title":"ELI5 Why do most internet providers tell you to turn your device off for 30 seconds then back on if you call them during an outage?

Up to season 5, Anthony Stewart Head (Giles) was that person - which was not out of the ordinary - he was older and perhaps played a more peripheral role in the show. \n\nBut then in season 6, when he was not in the opening credits, Alyson Hannigan (Willow) who had been in the show from season 1 got bumped up to that slot and started being introduced as: \" and Alyson Hannigan as Willow\".","answer":"Fame is important to an actor's career, and where they appear in the credits is a big contributor to that.  The big star gets top billing, the number 2 guy gets second billing, etc., etc.  \n\nBut sometimes there are two big stars.  Getting the last credit, with something distinctive, can be almost as prestigious as first credit.  \n\nThis is particularly important when an older, well established actor takes on a smaller role.  Both them and their show want everyone to know that successful and famous Danny DeVito is working on a project he likes, and not broke and pathetic Danny DeVito is so desperate for money he is playing a bit part on basic cable. \n\n"},

Most likely the Beyonder will have something to do with it, as he was responsible for the previous Secret Wars.  I'm not sure if characters will be totally rebooted or if they will have some from each previous universe be inserted into the new one.  \n\nAs to your question, I would pick you favorite character or group , (Cyclops, X-men), and then find some of the best story lines written for them, (Whedon's Astonishing X-Men), read those and start branching out from there.

{"title":"ELI5: Why does a coin previously rejected by a vending machine suddenly get accepted after being scratched against the machine?","answer":"It probably doesn't. This likely is a case of [confirmation bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias).  The coin acceptance mechanism is giving random results (or results due to small variables you cannot measure/control).   \n  \nYou think that doing this has some effect, and when it does you find it remarkable.

{"title":"ELI5: Why do vitamins and certain meds change the color of your urine?","answer":"Some compounds contain conjugated double bonds - the atoms are held together in a series of alternating double and single bonds.

Too much vitamin A or its precursor, beta carotene, will make your urine orange for the same reason.\n\nSome medications are compounds with the same conjugated double bond system, and will also change the color of your urine. \n\nWe use compounds with conjugated double bonds as dyes for food and clothing."},

{"title":"ELI5: How does thumbs up/thumbs down work on music stream sites like Pandora, Spotify, etc? How do they improve your station?","answer":"It all gets factored into a big equation that chooses what songs to play. \n\nFirst, each song is categorized by experts. (for Pandora, it's called the [Music Genome Project](http://www.pandora.com/about/mgp)) Every song has a score in a bunch of different areas (vocal style, use of different instruments, certain types of rhythmic arrangements). \n\nThen, every time you 'thumbs up' a song, it records all the categories the song falls into. So, if you thumbs-up a country song, for example, you might get points in your record for 'acoustic guitar', 'solo male singer', 'strong vocal performance', 'classic country rhythm', etc. Then, if you 'thumbs down' another song, it gives you negative points in other categories. Eventually, your profile has  values assigned to every category you've commented on. \n\nThen, it plays songs that include a majority of the categories you like with as little as possible of the categories you don't like. \n\nOften, such an algorithm is helped by the 'seed', or the first few songs that you choose in order to tell it the right area to look.

{"title":"ELI5: Why is the UN Convention Against Torture extremely vague when it comes to \"lawful sanctions\"?","question_detail":"Torture, under Article 1.1 of the UN Convention Against Torture, is thusly defined as:\n\n\"**[A]ny act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.**\"\n\nHowever, here's what really bug me the most. Article 1.1 of the Convention adds that torture \"**does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.**\"\n\nWhat is the definition of a lawful sanction then? Going by this definition, solitary confinement, flogging, and corporal punishment as practiced by Singapore, Malaysia, and  Saudi Arabia would fall under the \"lawful sanction\" clause, yet condemned by the UN as torture. It's like as if the lawful sanction clause made the definition of certain torture-like techniques difficult.","answer":"No, they mean for instance people slowly and painfully starving to death in a country that is under lawful trade sanctions and thus unable to feed it's populace as a direct result of those sanctions is not torture.\n\nedit: Just going to show that the UN, just like any other power structure, is prone to the \"it's only legal if WE do it\" fallacy.\n\nIn any case, many countries are not bound at all by the convention as they never ratified it. ~~The USA is one such country.~~ The US is only partially bound by it as it ratfied it with reservations. And the UN actually acknowledged that the US is not bound by UN jurisdiction with regards to some torture when some kids tried to have former ambassador Mel Sembler brought up by the UN on torture charges, and the UN refused to do so, in writing, giving the specific reason that they had no jurisdiction in the case as the US was not signatory to that convention.

{"title":"ELI5: In MLB, how do the judges decide the amount of money given to players.","question_detail":"During salary arbitration specifically, I'm just curious how the process works and what their influences are. Thanks!","answer":"So, the team submits a number, and the player's representation submits a number. The panel *not* will haggle between - they either pick one or the other. They look at the player's statistics on the field, overall contribution to the team, and the salary of similar players production-wise that have the same amount of service time as the player. They look at what *those* players are making, and use that to decide market value. Then they go with whatever proposed value is closest.\n\nMost players do not go to arbitration. Most players don't qualify, and many teams try very hard to avoid the situation altogether because they view it as a hassle and a potentially damaging experience between the player and the team. For example, I follow the Indians, they went from 1991 to 2014 without going to arbitration once.

Even though it can measure things \"infinite number of numbers in a set\" but  it's an idea. Because it is nothing that can itself be measured it is something that is an idea of something that doesn't have an end. There are many ways that infinity doesn't give you a sense of a real number or a number in general. ∞/∞ doesn't give you one because infinities could be vastly different like the numbers between 1 and 1.000000000001 are different than the numbers between 0 and 10000000000069. ∞^0 isn't 1 and ∞ + -∞ doesn't give you 0.

{"title":"ELI5: Why do computers switches only have two states?","question_detail":"So to get down to the very basics, a computer is a compilation of switches that function in the on and off position. Any kind of action switches a whole lot of switches to perform simple functions like booting up the computer. Also referred to as binary code which deals in 1's and 0's, or on and off.\n\nWhy is that we have limited ourselves to only two states. Wouldn't it have been more beneficial to include a third state? A third state would likely allow for a lot more complexity given that first new languages would have to be written. Is the reason that the added size and complexity to every switch decrease the overall amount of switches able to fit in the limited space.\n\nAny answers and sources appreciated.","answer":"More states does not allow for more complexity.\n\nTo understand this, you need a bit of an understanding of a [Turing Machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine), the mathematical construct behind computers. A Turing Machine involves a machine that reads a symbol from a long string of symbols. Based off of a predefined set of rules and symbols, when a symbol is read the machine performs an operation. This operation can be to read a symbol from another place in the string of symbols or modify a symbol at a particular location. Mapping to a real world computer, the string of symbols is memory, the machine is the CPU, and the rules are the specifics of the CPU's logic circuits. The symbols are 1 and 0 in a binary machine.\n\nPCs are a special type of Turing Machine called a [Universal Turing Machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Turing_machine). This means that a PC can simulate any other Turing Machine, including other Universal Turing Machines. Which essentially means, in terms of functionality, a binary computer can do everything a ternary computer, or even a 100-state computer can do. They are also equivalent in efficiency (Note that the definition of efficiency is specific to computer science and is a bit more esoteric. To read more, take a look at [Big O Notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation))\n\nWhat can change is how many steps it takes to perform calculations. 1 operation in a 100-state machine might (but another operation might not) take 100 operations to accomplish in a 2 state system. But when built, each operation in the 100-state machine might take 1000x as long as a single operation in a binary machine. Which essentially answers your question about why consumer CPUs are binary rather ternary. Our technology focuses on binary systems because it's easier to implement and fast. And adding more states does not allow a computer to do something more complex, nor be more efficient at doing something (Although it MAY be faster), which means we really don't have a fundamental reason to pursue it beyond academics.\n\nVersion for a literal 5 year old (or maybe 15. I dont remember when you get taught basic arithmetic and different bases for numbers). The capabilities of a computer can be defined as basic arithmetic operations. Add, subtract, multiply, divide. Binary or ternary computers fundamentally can only do those things. Lets say you want to add two numbers. Lets go through the mental steps of adding 2 base 10 numbers and do the same with base 2.\n\n\nBase 10:\n\n12+56=68\n\nMentally:\n\n1. 2+6 = 8\n\n2. 1+5 = 6\n\n3. Solution is 68\n\n\nBase 2 (Binary):\n\n0000 1100 + 0011 1000 = 0100 0100\n\nMentally:\n\n1. 0+0 = 0\n\n2. 0+0 = 0\n\n3. 1+0 = 1\n\n4. 1+1 = 10 (Carry the 1)\n\n5. 1+0+1 = 10 (Carry the 1)\n\n6. 1+0+1 = 10 (Carry the 1)\n\n7. 1+0+0 = 1\n\n8. 0+0 = 0\n\n9. Solution is 0100 0100\n\n\nBinary vs Base 10 (analogous to ternary) only impacts the number of operations, but doesn't allow the ternary machine to for example speak spanish."},

And why is almost everything behind a paywall?","question_detail":"So I'm trying to make my first annoted bibliography and the search for books on my topic (contributions of european scientists in post WW2 USA) has been mostly fruitless. How exactly do people search academia for serious texts? JSTOR has been mostly useless as with my account I can't even get a preview or abstract in most articles. \n\nAnd even among the books on my topic I have been able to find, how can find digital copies for them? So that I can actually read it. So far google searches haven't yielded many results and short of buying the actual books (a wee bit out of my budget) I can't think of anyway to read them for my project.\n\nAlso can anyone explain why is every single academic text behind a pay wall? I mean I could sort of understand why some authors would choose to have the full text hidden, but hiding abstracts too? It just seems counter productive because no one will want to buy the book without knowing at least what it's about.","answer":"We've got access to most journals through our university, and have a sign-in that opens all their websites up for us. Our library's webpage also has a search feature that will search through all journals that the university is subscribed to, which is super useful.\n\nLook into open access journals too. For those, we have to pay before we get published (thousands of dollars....) but it's free for you to read!

{"title":"ELI5: Why do smaller bicycle tires require higher air pressure than large ones to stay inflated?","answer":"Tyres are basically bubbles. As a bubble gets smaller, its volume/surface area ratio gets bigger (more volume of gas inside per square centimetre of surface). There's a nice simple equation: P(inside) = P(outside) + (4 x surface tension)/radius of bubble. Surface tension and the pressure of the atmosphere are fixed, so as the radius goes down  P(inside) gets huge.\n\nBicycle tyres can't change size to make their pressure inside optimal for keeping them inflated (unlike soap bubbles), so you have to change the pressure inside with your bicycle pump to satisfy the equation so it will stay inflated.

A day is the same all the time. Sun goes up, sun goes down, and it always takes the same amount of time. Then you can divide it into whatever arbitrary units you want, for whatever reason, we picked 24 hours in a day, and then 60 minutes in an hour, and then 60 seconds in a day. For most every day purposes, this works fine. It doesn't matter that the second is arbitrary, plenty of units are arbitrary. But as science progressed, they needed to be more precise, and simply defining a second as a 60th of a 60th of a 24th of a day wasn't going to work because the day may actually not be quite as precise as we thought. It can be getting slightly shorter and slightly longer, and that will fuck up our measurements in science. So scientists got together and they found a real thing in nature, the \"9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom\" and that phenomenon correlates precisely to how long the second that we've been using for hundreds of years is, and they defined the second as that.

Neuroplasticity is the ability of our brain to form connections between neurons and modify them so as to create links between neurons that participate in a specific task. To perform a task effectively and efficiently, that is with accuracy and with speed we need to have connections which are in no. able to carry out the task and also are in such a manner that they uses least amount of energy possible (the less the energy requirement the less the work needed to be done to bring that amount of energy to brain), and thus the person having connections enough and in order that they need very less energy to perform the task are tend to smarter at those tasks and whose are not are dumb at those tasks. That's specificity is the reason why a person who is brilliant at maths may not be so brilliant in a hand to hand combat or at playing piano.\n\nPS: If the OP is looking for the answer about the people who are brilliant and everything and some who suck at everything the answer is same as above its just their brain forms effective connections all the time.

{"title":"ELI5: Why did the use of \"You all (y'all)\" become so popular?","question_detail":"It even seems to be used when speaking to a single person, it just seems weird.","answer":"The confusion comes in because \"y'all\" can refer to \"you and additional persons who are not physically present at this time,\" much as \"we\" can.   \n\nIf I see a friend and ask, \"Are y'all coming to the party?\" That would imply he and his wife.

La frecuencia es cuantas ondas pasan en un segundo, llamado Hertz.\nLa luz es el efecto entre el movimiento de dos ondas, una que va en de arriba abajo y otra que va de un lado a otro,  de estas dos ondas una es magnética y otra eléctrica, la luz no son dos cosas distintas si no es el efecto.\nDependiendo de la frecuencia, hay distintos tipos de onda,  hay ondas de radio, la luz infrarroja, luz visible, luz ultravioleta, los rayos x y los rayos gama. \nLa luz visible es la que nuestros ojos pueden ver,  gracias a esto podemos distinguir los colores.\n"},

Often these locations are far apart in the left/right front/back sense but also in height as well. \n\nSo the operator is in a cab and they can see a person at the loading site. that person gives them signals telling them how where they need the pickup made and then when the load is ready to be lifted. This is done by hand signals but can be done with radio as well. \n\nThe operator knows the rig capabilities, knows the weather effects cause they are sitting in the weather, and can see the whole site. \n\nFollowing the guidance of another person they place the load where it needs to be. Sometimes the operator can not see teh actual drop site as it is interior to a space or in a hole so hand signals and radio are again used to tell them status.\n\nBut the operator knows by knowing the site how far out on the boom the load needs to be in order to thread some home/opening. Sometimes the load will be controlled by guy ropes  so it can be turned as it is being delivered. The operator works to ensure the load is not moved in ways which endanger those helping guide the load. \n\nBasically the operator knows the site and sees what they can but depends heavily on signals from others.

I used to think bronies were stupid. I laughed at them.  But then I started seeing pony porn on my rule 34 sites.  I still made fun of it.  But I kept seeing more and more.  Then one day I saw one image in particular.  The art was astounding.  It made me realize that there might be more to the show than I've been giving it credit.  So I decided to give it a try and watch a few episodes.  I did and was hooked. I watched the first 3 seasons in like 2 weeks.\n\nI soon discovered that my city had a brony community, and they had meetups.  So, I went to one, and had a ton of fun.  Soon, I had a bunch of new friends, and soon after, a pegasister girlfriend (we've been together for over a year now).\n\nSo, yeah. Bronies watch the show and movies. We enjoy the characters as they are well written.  And while a lot of bronies don't like clop (pony porn), some do including me, and it's not really weird because we like the characters, not the fact they are ponies.  Although some clop is humanized, as different people have different tastes.\n\nEdit: oh, and there is a bit of a crossover with the furry fandom, but that's not representative of all of us.  I'm not a furry, but I have no problem seeing furry porn.  It's not my cup of tea, but some of it can be good."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why are products usually more expensive directly from the manufacturer?","answer":"MSRP\never seen that? It means Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price, AKA \"full retail.\"\n\nIt's what the manufacturer determines a fair price to be at a retail level. They sell to shoppes at wholesale because they buy large quantities then those shoppes can mark the product up and make profit. \nMost shoppes add 40% to their cost to set a sales price. If MSRP is more than 40% over retail, you get it cheaper from the shoppe. \nThe manufacturer doesn't care about your one purchase, it cares about Walmart's 10million purchases. They'll sell to you for whatever price they decided it's worth but they don't worry about competing with Walmart because they don't compete with Walmart"},

{"title":"ELI5: Nielsen ratings and Nielsen families","question_detail":"does it explain why some horrible shows are on television?","answer":"I was a Nielsen family circa 2002-2003. Here's how it worked. \n\nA representative for Nielsen just showed up at our house one day with one of those Cracker Barrel gift baskets and said congratulations you've been selected to be a Nielsen home for one year. If you accept you get monetary compensation, it wasn't a lot maybe $100.00 for the year. \n\nA technician came over and installed a box with four or five lights on it. Each light corresponds to a profile (male or female and age) of a person in the house. I was the third light. You also got a remote with button that would activate your light on the box. So when you sat down to watch a show, you and whoever was with you would activate your lights and it would send a message to Nielsen and say ; a twenty year old male and a 19 year old female are watching this show. I think after a half hour or an hour the lights on the box would flash meaning it wanted to confirm you were still watching. Tally up all the information from the Nielsen homes and you can get your ratings figure. Hope this helped. "},

{"title":"ELI5: Why do most movies/shows place some actors last, even though they had large parts?","question_detail":"The most recent examples I can think of are in the Marvel movies. In the Winter Soldier credits, for example, they list all the main actors normally, and then the credits come up with \"With Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce\" and \"And Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury\". Same thing happened with the Avengers credits, where Jackson is credited both by his character's name, and last in sequence. \n\nThese guys had a pretty large parts, so what's the deal? Is it just for the older/ more famous actors in the cast?","answer":"It's called 'last billing', and it's actually a desirable position. You want your name to be the *first* credit the audience sees (top billing) or the *last* credit the audience sees before the movie actually starts (last billing) because those have the most impact, while the names jammed in the middle are the less important. Adding \"with\", \"and\", or \"and ____ as ____\" is a way to emphasise that person's name and to indicate that the credits are over (imagine reading a list like \"Eggs, bread, milk, apples, and lemonade\", you only use one 'and' at the end). \n\nExamples: 30 Rock is \"Tina Fey, Judah Frielander, Jane Krakowski, Tracy Morgan and Alec Baldwin\", It's Always Sunny is \"Glenn Howerton, Rob McElhenny, Charlie Day, Kaitlin Olson and Danny DeVito as Frank Reynolds.\" \n\nIt is especially common when the biggest celebrity in the show couldn't really be said to be the star, since the star is expected to have top billing. Tina Fey is the focus of 30 Rock and has the most screentime by a mile, so she gets top billing, but Alec's by far the most famous person on set, so he gets last billing."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why does my dog's leg start shaking when I scratch her on specific places?","question_detail":"And why is it just one specific leg?","answer":"Dogs shake or kick their legs when you scratch them because of something known as the scratch reflex. It's a completely involuntary reaction, which explains why your dog may look as puzzled as you do when it starts to happen. When you scratch or tickle your dog's belly, it irritates him, much the same way that the wind or a bug might. It activates nerves under his skin that are connected to his spinal cord and relays a message to his leg muscles to kick in an attempt to get rid of the irritant. Of course, you're the one both providing the \"itch\" and \"scratching\" it, so it's a completely pointless act. -  http://www.animalplanet.com/pets/why-do-dogs-shake-their-legs/"},

{"title":"ELI5: Why do Android phones get carrier \"Bloatware\", but iPhones do not?","question_detail":"Can manufacturers like Samsung control this?","answer":"Iphones don't have bloat because Apple controls both the software and the hardware. Everything is in their control. Upside, no bloat and the phones and software can be optimised to a degree that Android phones cannot; downside, it is a very closed ecosystem - Apple decides what you will get and you cannot 'shop' around, so to speak. \n\nWith Android, the software belong to Google, but the hardware belong to whoever designed the phone. Google just sells the license to use the software to phone designers and carriers and allows both to change part of the software. Upside: Android is more customisable and there is a far broader range of phones available with it; downside, there are many more different companies involved in the process and each can add their own bloatware. Additionally, this also means that software updates cannot get rolled out as quickly as ios updates. "},

{"title":"ELI5: Why is the TPP negotiated in secret?","question_detail":"I'm asking for the legal or policy justification--NOT some version of \"because nobody would like it if they could see it\".  To me, this seems like an unusual way of setting policy.","answer":"It's not secret exactly.  The point is that in general, in trade agreements, each point in the agreement give a tiny benefit to millions and millions of people, but at the same time a huge hit to a few people.  So let's say there are 100 people in our country, and there are 100 separate articles in the new trade agreement we're negotiating, and each article will cost one person $30, but will be worth $1 to everyone else in the country.  Make sense? If we unveil the negotiations at the end, and take an up-down vote on the whole thing, then everyone will say: \"Oh... so... I gain $99 and I lose $30? Huh, sounds like a pretty good deal.\" And it gets approved.\n\nBut if instead we announce, \"First, we are going to negotiate the sock-trading agreement, which will cost cuicocha $30 and bring in $1 to everyone else,\" then you immediately say, goddammit, and you start to rant and kick up a fuss about how unfair and immoral and dangerous this sock-trading agreement is; and because no one else is going to be put up a huge fight over a measly $1, you have a good chance of derailing that part of the agreement.\n\nSo probably what you've heard about trade authority is that the purpose is to allow the President to pass treaties without any real discussion or scrutiny of the bill - in that sense you might thing it's *secretive* if not secret - but actually, the purpose is just to get an up-or-down vote on the entire trade bill at the end of the process rather than making it an open-ended, multi-part affair where every single national special interest tries to manipulate its own government at every stage in the negotiations and the ratification."},

In fact we could never even catch up to the light rays emitted from earth ten seconds ago. So it impossible to “see the past from a great distance” in any meaningful way, because that past is in a different place. The very idea of “now” and “the past” is ambiguous when dealing with two distant locations. For all practical, even impractical purposes, anything you see is happening at the moment you see it (rather than at some time in the past when light rays were emitted).\n\nTo that other being on a planet a hundred million light years away, there are dinosaurs roaming the earth *right now*.\n"},

We are a nation built on the rule of law, it goes against everything that involves if the case is not handled properly, every box checked, and both sides afforded the best opportunity to prepare a prosecution and defense. \n\nTo throw that out in the name of speed of assumed guilt is to throw out the rule of law.

It has to do a bit with the placebo effect. (You can even convince a sober person that he's drunk with non-alcoholic beer.) if you are trying to stay lucid and serious, your brain will fight the intoxication rather than amplifying it.\n\nDon't misunderstand - you are still drunk.

Oceans, lakes, icebergs, swimming pools, even a white bath full of water will look slightly blue-ish. \n\nOf course it's because water *is* slightly blue. You just need a decent amount of it before that can be seen. A glass of water doesn't have nearly enough to appreciate the colouration, so it looks clear. "},

{"title":"ELI5: How would warfare be conducted in a \"Concrete Jungle\" such as NYC?","answer":"Before I answer OP, if there was a full scale revolution in the US then one of these situations seems much more likely. \n\nNow from the defensive point, hiding sharpshooters in tall buildings is one of the easiest parts. They can harass the invaders with minimal troop deployment. Secondly the defenders would probably hold a central area as a base and then hold and release different streets and buildings as a way to wear down the invaders. A handful of men can hold a building for sometime against a much larger force of they have a good hour or two to fortify it. Forcing the attackers to go through the roof allowing escape through the sewers wastes limited attacking resources. They would continue this guerrilla warfare until the enemy was vulnerable enough to launch a mass attack against. Basically in any environment that you can, guerrilla warfare is a wonderful defense. It really forces the attackers to spread out and creates much more fatigue on them since it is hard to win a war against someone who is just harassing you. For them every time you are attacked is a victory, while you are constantly losing men. \n\nFrom the offensive stand point, either you care about the people in the city or you don't. If you care, then it is the slow crawl. The city is taken block by block. Building by building. This is how the US fought in Iraq. It is hard because the defenders will result to guerrilla warfare to slow you down. If you don't care and the people in the city them you blow it to pieces. Tanks and bombers level the city and you march right on through.\n\n\nAlso modern militaries are prepared for pretty much every single possibility there is."},
{"title":"ELI5: Computer game settings.","question_detail":"I don't understand stuff like SAOO SXAA, G-Sync. Ect.\n\nCan someone please explain it to me? ","answer":"SAO is a lighting effect.\n\nGoogle doesn't immediately come up with anything for SXAA, but similarly named things are for antialiasing (that's the \"aa\" bit). This smooths out the hard edges of an image and makes the world feel a little more natural, with less visibly jagged lines.\n\nIf by G-synch you mean Vsync, it's a method to prevent screen tearing. Screen tearing is where your screen draws half of one image and half of another, resulting in two \"torn\" images instead of a whole single image. It's only for a single frame, but it can still be pretty ugly.\n\nI get the impression you've never read these, only heard them spoken aloud, since you're spelling them wrongly. Why are you asking?"},
{"title":"ELI5: How do rubbing either a banana or toothpaste on a scratched CD make it work again?","question_detail":"How is this possible? I learned this trick a while back. First with tooth paste, but now I hear doing this with bananas have the same effect. Why?","answer":"CD's are read with a laser. Scratches on the CD cause the laser to shoot off in an uncontrolled direction rather than reflecting it back to the optic sensor, so it can't read the digital music or data on that part of the disk. For music CD's, you could get a little tchk-tchk-thck as the disk spins, or a blast of static, or a completely unreadable disk as a result, depending on the severity and direction of the scratch.\n\nToothpaste has diatoms - microscopic sea-living creature's shells that fossilized and now make up chalk - or other abrasive powder mixed into it which normally goes toward gently scratching the plaque off of your teeth. But it also works on the scratches on the CD's surface like an orbital sander if you use it correctly, gently removing the hard edges of the scratch so it's more rounded and doesn't redirect the laser light off as badly. You've effectively polished the scratch away.\n\nSorry, can't speak for how bananas do it, but it might be the same principle."},
{"title":"ELI5: Why is hair loss so difficult to cure?","question_detail":"I'm surprised that, given our current knowledge of biochemistry and genetics, a real treatment still does not exist. Thanks in advance for any insights!","answer":"To be honest, there's probably no treatment for it because it's not life-threatening, or even debilitating in any way, and thus not really worth putting a lot of money and effort into curing. The only thing it really hurts is your self-image, but that depends on your own views about hair.\n\nPlus, hair loss can also be a symptom of some other problem (drug use/abuse, poor nutrition, stress, exposure to toxic chemicals/radiation, etc.) than a standalone problem in and of itself. So if you are losing your hair and it's not just because you're getting old, you've probably got bigger problems to worry about."},
{"title":"ELI5: Why doesn't the United States get to vote on issues like gay marriage the way Ireland just did?","answer":"We don't change the Constitution via referendum because our government isn't structured like that; Ireland's government, however, is. Many states have had their state constitutions amended via voter referendum (some instances of this included some states changing the definition of marriage to be that between a man and a woman).\n\nThe thing to take away from the Ireland same sex marriage referendum is that their constitution explicitly defined marriage as that between a man and a woman, and [a voter referendum was required to change that provision.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amendments_to_the_Constitution_of_Ireland) We, first and foremost, do not have an explicit definition of marriage in our constitution, so the courts have been determining the issue of same sex marriage within our given framework.

Why is this, slash why can't I always control full \"deep\" breaths?","answer":"Your lungs aren't 100% filled and emptied when you're breathing normally. \n\nThere are different capacities that your lungs an inhale/exhale. These include things like **tidal volume** which is the volume of air you inhale/exhale normally, **inspiratory and expiratory reserve volume** which are the amount of *extra* air you can inhale/exhale during normal tidal breathing, and **residual volume** which is the volume of air left in your lungs regardless of how much you exhale and also helps maintain shape of the lungs. \n\n[This is a great resource that can explain it in more detail if you wish.](http://www.cliffsnotes.com/sciences/anatomy-and-physiology/the-respiratory-system/lung-volumes-and-capacities)"},

{"title":"ELI5: Why is Avatar considered revolutionary for its time?","question_detail":"People always say that the CGI and the visuals of James Cameron's Avatar were revolutionary, but I was wondering whether anyone could provide some context regarding it. Thanks!","answer":"James Cameron filmed most of the movie on a lens-less camera, which is technology that he invented (i believe that's correct), and as he was filming the scenes in real time the animations and CGI would be rendered onto a screen for them to see. So the actors and director could visualize the scene in it's entirety (albeit the graphics were not the final version and were low poly) on a screen in front of them as they acted, helping both parties involved. On top of that, it was the first movie to really be shot FOR 3-d, versus being ported to 3-d in post productions. On top of that even further, it's a James Cameron movie and will always receive extreme amounts of hype and dollars in the billions. \n\nHope this helped. "},

With other people, you can't see their veins in their arms. Why is this?","answer":"Part of it is genetics, but a big part is do to body fat percentage. With the less body fat your veins are closer to the skin as they are not covered by a layer of fat. As muscles expand they will also push these veins against the skin, making them more visible. When you workout, veins will dilate in the area where the muscle is being worked, as more blood is being supplied to these muscles. "},

{"title":"ELI5:Does it take more energy to cool something than it does to heat it?","answer":"Roughly speaking, it takes the same amount of energy to heat something e.g. water from 25degC to 30degC as it does to cool it e.g. water from 25degC to 20degC \n\nHowever, as you heat or cool materials, the properties change. For example, with water the heat capacity (how much energy it takes to change the temperature of 1kg material by 1degC) is lower as temperature increases. Therefore, if you heat from 25degC to 50degC, that will require MORE energy than heating from 50degC to 75degC. Not by much however, probably less than 0.1% difference. \n\nDifferent materials have different properties, so it can vary. In general, for small temperature differences (&lt;100C difference), it is about the same. "},

There does seem to be a correlation that people experience it when they exhale, which would seem to suggest that the salts are somehow exhaled from your lungs, but that goes against what is known chemically about salts. \n\nSo, as it seems, there is no currently accepted answer as to how this happens."},

","answer":"It's not \"whatever they want\" it is \"whatever they negotiated\".  The people sending the bills choose not to make their IT more complex to reflect the negotiated prices with every possible insurance company.  For some reason, the insurance companies are OK with that, and they respond with numbers from their negotiated rates (they only have to code up the one set of rates).  I guess it's easier, but it does lead to some whack response letters."},
{"title":"ELI5: Why are objects in the mirror closer than they appear?","answer":"Because when you're looking at the mirror, the light travels from the object, bounces off the mirror then reaches your eye.\n\nLight travels in straight lines and distance affects the size that objects appear to us. Think of the last time you looked down a long straight road, the further into the distance you look, the smaller the street appears. \n\nTheoretically, if the mirror is perfectly flat, then two objects could appear the same size. One would be at a distance from the mirror, the other would be the distance from object 1 to mirror + the distance of your eye to mirror. \n\nAlso, some mirrors are shaped in a way to allow a larger field of view (it usually is concave out like an upside down cereal bowl) but those are easily distinguishable. Some car mirrors might be slightly concave in either direction to affect your ability to see around the vehicle. "},

Lobbyists? Outsourcing? Global economies?\n\nOr are the 50's just idolized because it's long enough ago nobody really remembers or cares?","answer":"Another thing that's different is that marginal tax rates for the very rich were still high,  in part to help pay for WWII. This meant that it was more advantageous to invest money in real enterprises, rather then just keeping it in the bank and collecting interest at a lower rate. \nAlso, the GI Bill meant that large numbers of returning soldiers were able to afford higher education (this is how my grandfather, who commanded a tank in WWII, attended Stanford and became an electrical engineer), leading to a reduction in the less-skilled/educated labor force. Less supply means people are willing to pay more for it. That meant that even low-wage earners were making a living wage, while an expanded educated population was able to form a thriving middle class, combined with steady growth from real capital investment. \n\nSince then, we've seen a stagnating minimum wage that's roughly half of what it used to be, in real terms (not keeping up with inflation), skyrocketing tuition leading to higher student loan debts, major tax breaks for the wealthiest of us, combined with eroding Union membership and less labor representation. \nLong story short, the poor and middle class generally had it better, economically speaking, than they do now. \n\nOf course, some of this is rose-tinted glasses. Things were great for the country as a whole, financially, but we're definitely a hell of a lot better off now, as far as civil rights go.

{"title":"ELI5: Why is drinking while driving illegal?","question_detail":"First off, please don't confuse this with me asking why drinking and driving is illegal.

When I moved to New Mexico in the early '80's it was OK.  The law said that you couldn't be intoxicated while driving.   If you weren't intoxicated, you were fine.

{"title":"ELI5: Is it possible to create a hiearchy of available band with on a home wifi?

Don't spend hours setting it it up, you'll only be disappointed when your idiot siblings continue to take all the upload bandwidth (and thus make you lag in games) uploading their stupid pictures to facebook.\n\nIf you're truly determined to take back control of your network, you might want to consider going enterprise.  Obviously, cisco's a bit out of the realm of reasonableness for a single home, but mikrotik makes some products that will blow anything that comes off of Best Buy's shelves completely out of the water for about as much as a top of the line Linksys router.

{"title":"ELI5: Bitcoin","answer":"If you still can’t figure out what the heck a bitcoin is, this simple explanation for a five-year-old may help you ...\n\napple-bitcoin\n\nWe’re sitting on a park bench. It’s a great day. I have one apple with me, I give it to you.\n\nYou now have one apple and I have zero. That was simple, right?\n\nLet’s look closely at what happened:\n\nMy apple was physically put into your hand. You know it happened. I was there, you were there – you touched it.\n\nWe didn’t need a third person there to help us make the transfer. We didn’t need to pull in Uncle Tommy (who’s a famous judge) to sit with us on the bench and confirm that the apple went from me to you.\n\nThe apple’s yours! I can’t give you another apple because I don’t have any left. I can’t control it anymore. The apple left my possession completely. You have full control over that apple now. You can give it to your friend if you want, and then that friend can give it to his friend, and so on.\n\nSo that’s what an in-person exchange looks like. I guess it’s really the same, whether I’m giving you a banana, a book, a quarter, or a dollar bill …\n\nBut I’m getting ahead of myself.\n\nBack to apples!\n\nPixelated apple\nNow, let's say I have one digital apple. Here, I’ll give you my digital apple. Ah! Now it gets interesting.\n\nHow do you know that digital apple which used to be mine, is now yours, and only yours? Think about it for a second. It’s more complicated, right? How do you know that I didn’t send that apple to Uncle Tommy as an email attachment first? Or your friend Joe? Or my friend Lisa too?\n\nMaybe I made a couple of copies of that digital apple on my computer. Maybe I put it up on the internet and one million people downloaded it.\n\nAs you see, this digital exchange is a bit of a problem. Sending digital apples doesn’t look like sending physical apples.\n\nSome brainy computer scientists actually have a name for this problem: it’s called the double-spending problem. But don’t worry about it. All you need to know is that it’s confused them for quite some time and they’ve never solved it. Until now.\n\nBut let’s try to think of a solution on our own.\n\nLedgers\n\nLedger\n \n\nMaybe these digital apples need to be tracked in a ledger. It’s basically a book where you track all transactions  –  an accounting book.\n\nThis ledger, since it’s digital, needs to live in its own world and have someone in charge of it.\n\nJust like World of Warcraft, say. Blizzard, the guys who created the online game, have a “digital ledger” of all the rare flaming fire swords that exist in their system. So, cool, someone like them could keep track of our digital apples. Awesome  –  we solved it!\n\nProblems\n\nThere’s a bit of a problem though:\n\n1) What if some guy over at Blizzard created more? He could just add a couple of digital apples to his balance whenever he wants!\n\n2) It’s not the same as when we were on the bench that day. It was just you and me then. Going through Blizzard is like pulling in Uncle Tommy (a third-party) out of court (did I mention he’s a famous judge?) for all our park bench transactions. How can I just hand over my digital apple to you in the usual way?\n\nIs there any way to closely replicate our park bench transaction digitally? Seems kinda tough …\n\nThe Solution\n\nLedger\n \n\nWhat if we gave this ledger  to everybody? Instead of the ledger living on a Blizzard computer, it’ll live in everybody’s computers. All the transactions that have ever happened, from all time, in digital apples, will be recorded in it.\n\nYou can’t cheat it. I can’t send you digital apples I don’t have, because then it wouldn’t sync up with everybody else in the system. It’d be a tough system to beat. Especially if it got really big.\n\nPlus, it’s not controlled by one person, so I know there’s no one that can just decide to give himself more digital apples. The rules of the system were already defined at the beginning.\n\nAnd the code and rules are open source – kinda like the software used in your mom’s Android phone. Or kinda like Wikipedia. It’s there for smart people to maintain, secure, improve, and check.\n\nYou could participate in this network too – updating the ledger and making sure it all checks out. For the trouble, you could get like 25 digital apples as a reward. In fact, that’s the only way to create more digital apples in the system.\n\nI simplified quite a bit … But that system I explained exists. It’s called the Bitcoin protocol. And those digital apples are the bitcoins within the system. Fancy! So, did you see what happened?\n\nWhat does the public ledger enable?\n\n1) It’s open source, remember? The total number of apples was defined in the public ledger at the beginning. I know the exact amount that exists. Within the system, I know they are limited (scarce).\n\n2) When I make an exchange I now know that digital apple certifiably left my possession and is now completely yours. I used to not be able to say that about digital things. It will be updated and verified by the public ledger.\n\n3) Because it’s a public ledger, I didn’t need Uncle Tommy (third-party) to make sure I didn’t cheat, or make extra copies for myself, or send apples twice, or thrice…\n\nWithin the system, the exchange of a digital apple is now just like the exchange of a physical one. It’s now as good as seeing a physical apple leave my hand and drop into your pocket. Just like on the park bench, the exchange involved two people only. You and me , we didn’t need Uncle Tommy there to make it valid.\n\nIn other words, it behaves like a physical object.\n\nBut you know what’s cool? It’s still digital.\n\nWe can now deal with 1,000 apples, or 1 million apples, or even .0000001 apples. I can send it with a click of a button, and I can still drop it in your digital pocket if I was in Nicaragua and you were all the way in New York.\n\nI can even make other digital things ride on top of these digital apples! It’s digital after all. Maybe I can attach some text on it – a digital note. Or maybe I can attach more important things; like say a contract, or a stock certificate, or an ID card …\n\nSo this is great! How should we treat or value these “digital apples”? They’re quite useful aren’t they?\n\nWell, a lot of people are arguing over it now. There’s debate between this and that economic school, between politicians, between programmers. Don’t listen to all of them though. Some people are smart; some are misinformed. Some say the system is worth a lot; some say it’s actually worth zero.

{"title":"ELI5: Why are last names generally more diverse than first names?","answer":"For the most part, European/Western history, first names were given after various Saints, religious prophets, and other religious characters, which overall were short in order to make them easy to say. However when technology started to become more advanced, less people needed to work on farms, so villages began being built to support trade. This began to pose a problem, as the greater the population of density, the greater the chance of finding another person with the same name, which could make things a bit problematic (last names did not exist at this point for lower class people, only lords). Also around this time, governments began being interested in documenting people, mainly for taxation purposes, as many more people were free from farming and without a master, so last names began. Varying on the location, they were different, for example in and around England, often people gave themselves surnames by occupation, such as Carpenter, Baker, or Smith (Blacksmith) or just using some English word, Hope, for example. In some eastern European countries, instead of surnames, they used \"father names,\" where a child would take on his father's first name with a suffix, often the ownership conjugation of the name (ich or vich as the suffix), as his surname, then if the child was a male and had a child of his own, he would similarly pass on his first name again. Eventually governments decided to adopt the western system of not changing the surname each generation, and many people either chose new ones or permanently kept their \"father names\" as the ones they would pass on to their offspring. Later on when slavery of Africans began, slaves often would be forced to accept their masters surname as their own, and when slavery was abolished, they often kept that name, or changed it, one popular option at the time for one would be \"Freeman\" or \"Freedman.\" I do not know much about other areas of the world and their surnames, but here is my wall of text."},

{"title":"ELI5:If we regenerate new skin cells, why/how does our skin wrinkle?","answer":"Our DNA has protiens at its end called telomeres. They act like the plastic tip of sholaces that prevent laces from fraying. When we generate new skin cells, our DNA has to also be replicated and each time DNA replicates the telomeres at the ends of the DNA shortens. When we reach old age our cells would have regenerated numerous times. These repeated replications cause DNA to run out of telomeres and the cell will not be able to replicate. They then die off instead. As skin cells die, skin gets thinner and has less protection against radiation and other environmental damage which causes skin to display more wrinkles and signs of damage"},

{"title":"ELI5:What does it mean when people say the economy is bad?","question_detail":"Also, what was the housing crash of 2008? ","answer":"Depends on who you're talking to. If you're talking to a normal person, they're probably referring to the jobs market, more specifically how much they can get paid for their skill. If there are a lot of jobs present, then companies tend to have to fight more for their employees and wages go up, if there aren't a lot of jobs, less people have work, and the ones that have them are more satisfied in the fact that at least they have a job. This is what most people mean when referring to a bad economy, is how much money they can make in the economy.  Another point to consider is how much your dollar is worth, the cost of general living is generally on the rise, so if you aren't making more money at the same rate, then you end up making less money then you did. - once again, this is only from the perspective of a normal person, not CEO's, politicians, etc... But I would imagine that's what you were after.\n\nAs for the housing crash, there is an economic term called a bubble. \n&gt;An economic bubble (sometimes referred to as a speculative bubble, a market bubble, a price bubble, a financial bubble, a speculative mania or a balloon) is trade in an asset at a price or price range that strongly deviates from the corresponding asset's intrinsic value - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_bubble)\n\nHow this applies is that every bank that funds a person purchasing a home takes on a certain amount of risk. This is usually offset by the value of the home - if you default on your payment, they take the home, sell it and recover a lot of the money they invested. A series of bills introduced in the 80's and 90's made it so that bankers had to take a higher risk by accepting people who normally wouldn't qualify for a loan that big. This went on, backed by the federal and state governments, slowly getting more and more dangerous. Finally too many people weren't able to pay their mortgages, defaulted, and their homes were seized. The banks then put these homes on the market again, but in order to sell, due to the high amount of homes on the market - they sold at a significantly lower price than they paid. This, in turn, lowered the value of everyone else's home because equivalent homes to theirs were being sold at such a low cost.  There are a lot more at work, but this is the basic idea.

{"title":"ELI5: How can America be split so evenly between Republicans and Democrats?","question_detail":"How is it that the US population has been so evenly split between Republicans and Democrats for the last 100 years that both sides have had an equal chance of winning elections year after year, and Congress tends to be evenly split or switches from one majority to the other? How can there be an approximate 50/50 split year after year after year when it seems more logical that over time, one party would gain the majority of popular opinion and steadily decrease power from the opposite party?","answer":"As others have said, it's not that even. There are way more Democrats than Republicans, but 1) Republicans draw from older, whiter populations that are very consistent voters, and Democrats have substantially lower turnout. 2) Rural areas, which favor Republicans, are substantially overrepresented in the Senate and presidential race, and somewhat overrepresented in House races. 3) Many districts are gerrymandered, and over the last decade in particular the GOP has made working gerrymandered districts in their favor a priority. These last two factors combined mean that Democrats received over a million more votes for House candidates in 2014 but Republicans got 50-some more seats. \n\nIn addition to these structural factors, There am have been very successful efforts to disenfranchise likely Democratic voters over the last decade-plus. This includes making voting harder, purging voter rolls of eligible voters, and keeping prisoners ineligible. (Although prisoners are more likely to be aDemocratic voters, it is not necessarily true that **criminals** are more likely Democrats. For example, whites and blacks use drugs at roughly the same rate, but blacks are more likely to be caught -- not because of violence, but because they live in highly policed neighborhoods, they're more likely to be prosecuted if caught, and they're more likely to be convicted of a disenfranchising felony if prosecuted instead of a misdemeanor.)"},

Why are they coming out now? What is true/false about these videos/articles and their claims?\n\nAlso, is abortion as graphically violent as these sources say?","answer":"They are made by an anti-abortion group who heavily edits the videos and puts them out of context to make Planned Parenthood employees look bad.  There is no illegal activity.  If there was, their videos would have been evidence, but instead they sent them to Republican politicians right before a vote on Planned Parenthood funding.

The redness and some degree of swelling are pretty much instant, though it doesn't get really bad right away. Still, there's a physical reaction to any wound within seconds.

A group of cells keeps growing to the point you might feel a lump. \n\nChemotherapy is on the simplest level, a poison. Added to the body it kills the old cells that won't dye. The side effect is that it kills a lot of healthy cells too. That is why a patients hair will fall out and makes them feel sick. \n\nRadiation therapy is just another method to target cancer cells.

I'm currently a bus driver so I hope I can answer your question.\n\nThe stop button is there to let us know when you need the next stop. If a bus stops somewhere without anyone pushing the stop request button is because the driver knows a lot of people get off there or it's a \"time check.\" a time-check makes us stop at that location so that we're not too early when we approach other stops.\n\n\nNow, lets address why we can't stop and let you off just because you pulled the stop request button. Its both a liability on us (insurance and legal-wise), and is sort of a protection for drivers and passengers. Most bus stops are in an area with but not pertaining to: High traffic, Well lit, best point for multiple passengers to get to, insurance OK'd it, apartment/Lot owners OK'd it, Accessibility, negligible traffic conflicts, and general safety. sometimes when adding a new stop with a GPS on board is just a huge pain in the ass sometimes as well, so it's not do-able.\n\nYes, I get that I passed your apartment complex.

{"title":"ELI5: How do you 'colourize' a black and white picture?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"Let's start with a bit of color theory. A color is defined by three values; what shade it is, how bright it is, and how saturated it is. White to grey to black is a change in lightness. Red to orange to yellow is a change in hue. Red to pink to white is a change in saturation.\n\nImage editing software allows you to modify hue, saturation, and lightness independently of each other. A black and white picture contains only lightness information, so you can very easily add color into it by only modifying the other two values. In practice this take the form of setting the black and white image to Multiply mode, which makes the white parts transparent and keeps the black parts opaque. Then you just paint colors on a layer below that, effectively turning the process into a realistic coloring book. You might also want to go back to the original layer and start changing the black to other colors as appropriate, since things in shadow aren't just pure black in the real world. And you basically just keep fiddling with it like this until it looks right."},

{"title":"ELI5: When did companies start outsourcing customer service call centers to India and who started it?","question_detail":"Just got off the phone with AT&T to get my service moved to our new house. I was on the phone for 40 minutes and we could barely understand each other. It was mildly frustrating and I would so much rather speak to someone that lives in my country and speaks clear, fluent English. Especially for something that is very important to make sure small details, such as street addresses are correct. So where did this business practice start, and who thought it was actually a good idea?","answer":"Because Indians speak English and can be paid extremely low wages.\n\nMost companies don't really give a shit if they have terrible customer support because you've already bought the product. They view customer support as a money-loser that they have to put up with so they put as little funding into it as they possibly can.\n\nThankfully, some companies are starting to realize how much business they can attract with slightly higher prices and better support."},

{"title":"ELI5:How do mortgage companies make money","question_detail":"I understand they loan money at an interest rate.  HOWEVER, the money they are giving out (several hundred thousand at a whack), has to be outpacing the cash flow they are getting back from loan payers.  Please explain.","answer":"Banks don't finance their loans from people paying back other loans. That makes one wonder \"how did anyone make the first loan?\" Loans can be financed in three main ways.\n\n1) Deposits. This is how traditional banking works. Most people don't use most of the money in their account most of the time, so this frees up banks to lend it to other people.\n\n2) Borrowing. Many lenders actually borrow large sums of money to lend it to other people. As long as the interest the final borrowers pay is higher than what the lender paid, they can make money\n\n3) Investors. A borrower might take money from investors and lend it to customers. You may have heard of \"mortgage backed securities\" which were popular before the GFC. Effectively, banks lend money out on behalf of investors taking fees or a cut of the interest.\n\nIn all cases, the money comes from somewhere other than people paying back loans."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why is the horizontal division operator (÷) used so little in higher level math?","question_detail":"When I was in elementary school, we had worksheets that had questions like 20 ÷ 5 = ? and rarely ever saw the '/' used (as in 20 / 5 = ?).  \n\nNow after years of Calculus, I can't help but wonder the opposite is now true: ÷ is rarely ever seen, and fractional division is everywhere.  Why is division taught with ÷ at a young age if it so underutilized at higher levels?","answer":"Because in long complex equations, putting the numerator over the denominator makes the equation shorter and easier to see whats going on and to simplify the equation.

{"title":"Eli5: excessive cop cars in chase going on forever, or excessive cop backup","question_detail":"Watching some YouTube videos of,  specifically, LA cop chases. It seems like LA uses way more man power then other cities,  but anyways... \n\nSo a car is going 50 mph or slower.. Or hell,  even faster... But you see 5-10 cop cars.. Just following. Why not just initiate the pit maneuver? Especially at slower speeds? \n\nAnd to my second question.. So someone is in trouble with the cops...ans there's say.. Two officers. Within 30 seconds, you have 8 cops around you. What's the point of having 8 officers around you, especially I'd you may be even nearly or already detained?","answer":"A lot of time cops are arranged in patrol zones.  Each zone has it's own patrol car (or cars) plus a few \"floaters\" who go from zone to zone to help out as needed.  If a chase goes on for a while, it goes through multiple zones.  Cops from each zone try to intercept/stop the vehicle and when that fails they join the pursuit.  Where I live (rural Tennessee) it's not uncommon to hear on the scanner \"Unit A joining pursuit.  Unit B joining pursuit.  Unit C joining pursuit. [and so on, then] This is dispatch.  Units G and H, continue pursuit.  All other units, return to your zones.\"\n\nAs for your second question, sometimes cops get bored.  If they see a unit stopped somewhere or hear a call that's nearby, they'll stop themselves just to get some action.  Also, if cops have previously had problems at that address, or are looking for a violent suspect last known to be driving a vehicle similar to the one that's just been stopped, backup may seem excessive but it beats not going home alive at the end of the shift.\n\nPIT maneuver, spike strips, rolling roadblocks, and other methods aren't always successful.  If the driver isn't driving recklessly or actively trying to hurt somebody, just follow him until he realizes he's better off just giving up."},

{"title":"ELI5: How does a roux thicken a sauce?","answer":"Roux is butter (fat) and flour (starch). When you cook a starch, it expands and absorbs liquid. The butter in the roux helps prevent clumping like you would get if you poured straight flour into water.\n\nThink of it like you're cooking simple white rice. The rice absorbs the water as it cooks. The same principle is applied with roux, except you have less starch in comparison to water which is why it only thickens it instead of making it more of a gooey blob.\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: How does quantum entanglement work?","answer":"Quantum entanglement is a side effect of several quantum laws. The first thing that you must understand is that when matter is created from energy, this matter is created in pairs to satisfy many conservation rules. For example, if you have enough energy and the right kind of energy, you can create an electron and a positron (electron's antimatter equivalent). To satisfy the law of conservation of charge, the electron is negatively charged and the positron is positively charged. Quantum physics also introduces many many other conservation laws such as conservation of angular momentum, conservation of baryon number, ect. Basically all these mean that these numbers associated with all these conservation laws, will all add up to zero if matter is made from energy.\n\nAnother idea in quantum mechanics is quantum superposition. Quantum superposition says that a particle will be in both possible states until it's state is measured. For example, I will use charge. An electron will be both positively and negatively charged until it's charge needs to be measured. At the moment it will be measured, it will choose one. Although for charge, it will pretty much be measured instantly due to charge always interacting with its environment.\n\nQuantum entanglement is a result of conservation laws and superposition overlapping. When two particles are created from energy, some of their properties are in a superposition because they are not needed therefore not measured. When the property of one particle is measured, it chooses one state. To satisfy the conservation laws, its opposite's property must be instantly chosen. At first thought, this seems like faster than light information transfer is possible, but in reality, you do not know which state it will choose. If you use a property whose state is changeable, to change that state, you must change another nearby particles state to satisfy the conservation law, but its entangled partner's state does not change."},

{"title":"ELI5: How is it legal for ISP's to agree not to go into certain cities, doesn't this form a regional monopoly?","question_detail":"[deleted]","answer":"I don't think ISP's agree not to go into certain cities.  Could you share a link showing that?  Would love to explain that bit of it or learn about it.\n\nBut the main reason there is little competition in each city between ISP's (and thus creating a monopoly) is twofold.  First, you have to understand *barriers to entry* and how it relates to ISP's.  For there to be any competitor in any market, they must enter it.  Various markets have varying levels of barriers to entry.  To prevent a monopoly or oligopoly, you must make sure to limit barriers to entry.  There is a very high barrier to entry in the cable industry, and that is because it's expensive to come into any given city and lay infrastructure down when you've got to tear up roads and city blocks to do so.\n\nBut that begs the question -- wouldn't it be totally worth it for Time Warner to invade a city dominated by Comcast and undercut them, thus taking all their business and making the entry costs feasible?\n\nNot so fast.  \n\nThe next concept relates to economies of scale. In this context, it's very cheap for cable companies to add new subscribers.  It's very close to just flipping a switch and you're subscribed for months on end.  Unless the product is entirely different (dish or directv, or fiber internet), then competition would mean undercutting price.  By that I mean if Time Warner wanted to compete with Comcast in Seattle for broadband internet, the only way they'd be able to do it is by price since they are both using the same cable technology.  And since it's so very cheap to add new customers, they would simply both undercut each other until the price to subscribe literally loses each of them money.  Then it's a battle of attrition, with each company holding out in the city losing profits until one cannot take it anymore and exits the market. Then we got back to a monopoly.\n\nBecause of this fact, it's incredibly risky for a cable company to come into a city second, because they'd run the risk of 0 profits and going through that battle of attrition.  Much simpler is it to just look for emerging markets and get your network up and running there, or to lease the already existing infrastructure (as is the case here in Hawaii -- Hawaiian Telcom leases Time Warner Cable's pipes).  Of course, the government could step in and try and increase competition between ISP's by helping defray the cost of infrastructure, but show me a candidate who wants to tear up city blocks and cause traffic for months and I'll show you political suicide.\n\nThat's the skinny.\n\n"},

A second racial incident occurs on Oct. 5. By Oct. 10, dissatisfied by the administration’s tepid response, a group called Concerned Student 1950 stages a protest during the homecoming parade. Ten days later, the group issues eight demands, including “an increase in the percentage of black faculty and staff,” as well as Wolfe’s removal from office.\n\n&gt;A swastika drawn with feces is discovered in a bathroom on Oct. 24. Concerned Student 1950 has an inconclusive meeting with Wolfe three days later. Jonathan Butler, a protest leader, announces a hunger strike on Nov. 2. Another meeting with Wolfe takes place the next day, during which he promises, essentially, to do better.\n\n&gt; **In other words, nearly two months had gone by before the football players decided to get involved. Once they did, Wolfe lasted all of 36 hours.**\n\nThe article goes on to explain that there were significant economic repercussions to the university if the football team refused to play, starting with a $1 million penalty that would be owed the opposing team next week.\n\nAs further background, apparently racial tensions on the campus run deeper than the particular incidents of the last couple months. Blacks are a small minority on campus, 7.2%, in a [largely white state](http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/29000.html) (11.7% black vs. 13.2% in US, 80% white vs. 62% in US), and there's some evidence of a pattern of overt displays of racism (black students being called \"nigger\" on public streets; people driving trucks through campus waving confederate flags).

How are these things allowed to keep on happening?  ","answer":"France could request a peacekeeping force from the United Nations, and receive it with Security Council approval. But that's not France's problem--it's got plenty of military and police personnel. (Though this is a problem for some countries.) It's simply difficult to find and catch terrorists *before* an attack occurs. You need to know they are conspiring to commit an attack, and if you can't catch them during the planning stage, there are at least some vulnerable targets--no matter how large the police or military, you can't guard everywhere at once.\n\nIn short, there is no easy solution. Investigating any crime takes a while, and then the perpetrators have to be tracked down. That may not step any future attackers, who especially if they are working on their own, may be quite invisible until an attack occurs. Ultimately, no security policy can make people completely safe, and of course security must be balanced with liberty as well."},

{"title":"Eli5: How do \"extreme couponers\" manage to make a store owe them money for buying stuff? Shouldn't this be impossible?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"It is impossible.\n\nWhat you see in those Extreme Coupon shows are not normal circumstances. The show makes an arrangement with the store for it to temporarily ignore its own policies. That way they get publicity as a place of major deals and one joker gets to rip them off.\n\nA lot of places have weird policies about how many coupons you can use and in what arrangement. On the show they can use multiple coupons on the same item or places that \"double\" coupons will allow them to double above the normal limit. Like if it says they will double a coupon up to 40 cents they will still double a coupon worth $1 for this person only.\n\nIt also gets strange in that the finances of what is happening aren't exactly as straight forward as they pretend.\n\nHere's an example. Let's say that you buy a candy bar. You buy this candy bar for 80 cents. A coupon spits out giving you five cents off the next candy bar.\n\nYou buy another candy bar and use the coupon. This candy bar is now 75 cents. \n\nOkay in reality you have just spent $1.55 on two candy bars.  But some people will report they spent only $0.75, ignoring they had to buy one at full price first.  But then it gets weirder.\n\nLet's say this store didn't program their machines well enough and it spits out a second coupon. This one is for another 5 cents off the next candy bar.\n\nSome people will say at this point they have spent $1.50. They mental deduct the second coupon off the first candy bar. Or they consider the second candy bar to be really $0.70. Works out the same either way. They then purchase a third candy bar. It's still 75 cents but they start treating the coupons like they add up.\n\nIf you really read how some of these people calculate their \"real\" savings versus what they actually spend, it doesn't add up.\n\nWant some more strangeness? Okay, where do they get all those coupons?  You can't get that many from the Sunday paper. \n\nThe truth is many of them buy their coupons. If you look around on eBay people sell them. Selling actual coupons is illegal. But if you say the coupons are free and you are paying for the \"clipping\" fee, that's fine.\n\nA lot of people will pay up to 3/4ths the value of the coupon to get these coupons. You have a stack of 200 $1 off coupons people have been known to pay up to $150 to get them.  Even if you manage to use all of them, that means you paid $150 to save $200 for a net gain of $50.\n\nStrangely enough, when people brag about their savings they rarely mention this part.\n\nSo, to answer your question, there is no possible way for you personally to get a coupon that will have the store pay you to take something. You may be able to combine a sale and a coupon to get something for free, but if it works out as a negative number the store will not pay you to take it.\n\nThat is a special one time only thing worked out between a show and a person.\n\nEven when people talk about these big savings, the math may not be as straight forward as it seems. They may end up with a receipt that reads $1, but they may have spent several hundred elsewhere to get that $1 receipt.  \n\nLastly, some people get those really impressive numbers due to a little illegal trick called \"coupon fraud.\"  If the store catches you doing this getting banned from the store may be a best case scenario.  You can get up to [17 years](http://couponinformationcenter.com/faq.html) in prison.\n\nThere are various methods of performing coupon fraud. But one of the most common is to apply a coupon for a product you didn't buy.\n\nLet's say we have an oddball company that makes pickles and shoes. There is a limited amount of information that can be relayed in a standard bar code. So this company, Sneaker Pickles, issues a coupon for $10 off a pair of sneakers. Some people will go in and check the bar code and see if it matches close enough to the pickles that that the machine registers a product match between the coupon and the product bought.\n\nSo they buy a two dollar jar of pickles with a ten dollar off coupon for sneakers. But, because the codes don't contain enough information to tell the machine \"we meant jars of pickles only! Not any product we sell!\" the couple is applied and the woman gets $8 back as well as a hefty fine and potential prison time. "},

The second type can have multiple methods, and I'll describe 2. One is specific( meaning the code needed to validate it is dependent on something that's unique to every computer) and you'll need a keygen to get the code (Not that I recommend this practice, of course) and the other is not dependent on such a thing , so if someone shared a key online, you can copy paste to use it most of the time (Not that I endorse this practice), except if the program connects to the internet to check if the key is used.\n A real programmer would probably explain this better  "},

{"title":"ELI5: How is your brain able to recreate the sound of, for example, a song, perfectly in your head so it seems like you can hear it?","answer":"The best eli5 explanation I can give is that our brain stores music relying heavily on procedural memory.

For example, I can remember all the directions of how to drive a car to grandma's house and carry out the whole processes involved with little conscious effort. But hell if I can remember what shirt I wore two days ago. So like processes, music works like a chain of memories, each detail triggering the next. \n\nAs to the experience of recalling music, fMRI and EEG studies have shown that recalling music lights up many of the same centres of the brain as actually listening to music.

{"title":"ELI5: Why is Washington DC the capital of the US?","question_detail":"[deleted]","answer":"It was decided that the federal capital should be independent from the individual states, in part as the result of a violent demonstration from unpaid soldiers when Congress was meeting in Philadelphia. Congress demanded the governor of Pennsylvania protect them, but he refused. \n\nAs to why the swamp on the Potomac was chosen as the sight, it was a result of a compromise between Hamilton's Federalists and the Jeffersonians. Hamilton felt the economic viability of the nation depended on foreign trade, but the states owed foreign creditors tons of debt they'd used to prosecute the war, and it looked like quite a bit of it would go unpaid. Hamilton felt that would doom the national economy, so he planned to have the federal government take up the states' war debt and pay it from federal revenue. However, the Northern states carried much more debt than the South, who had already paid most of theirs. Ergo, Sourhern states would be contributing to pay Northern debt after they'd already taken care of their own. \n\nIn return, the South got the national capital. D.C. doesn't seem very Southern nowadays, but remember that Maryland and Delaware were slave states. "},

{"title":"ELI5:Why are the only flying mammals (bats) nocturnal?","question_detail":"[deleted]","answer":"First point to make is that not all bats are nocturnal. Fruit bats fly in the day time and find their food by sight and smell.\n\nThe ones that are nocturnal, like most animals they have evolved to exploit a space in the ecosystem. Birds are the dominant large flying creature and have evolved from a much older species (dinosaurs). They have certain traits that make them successful and they have been around a long time. Good night vision is not one of those traits. Even the ones that do specialise in low light flying like owls still don't fly in total darkness. Limiting their flying to dusk and dawn. \n\nMany insects take advantage of the night and they are an excellent food source that bats have evolved to exploit.\n\nEvolution is an amazing thing but a creature has a limited tool box to pull from.

{"title":"ELI5: what is the piezoelectric effect","answer":"It is related somewhat to quantum computing.\n\nIt's somewhat of a \"complication\" and something I don't even fully understand (made an askScience post).\n\nBasically. Quantum computing uses qbits which are bits that can fluctuate states and change from either 0 or 1 in binary. Right now, computers have transistors in their chips that fire electric bursts and open and close gates. It can result in a 0 or 1. These binary bits firing on a large scale make up everything. Programs, pictures of cats, a video game, etc.\n\nThe difference between non quantum computer bits is that these transistor states are one way only. It can either be a 0 or 1.\nQuantum bits on the other hand, can fluctuate it's state. It can be a 0 or 1 at the same time, in all combinations. This is very powerful. The qbit can then basically be whatever state it needs to be simultaneously rather than relying on another bit being a different state.\n\nThis piezoelectric effect is more of a complication. If data is in a qbit, and it then fluctuates it's state, this data would then be corrupted. This is called the piezoelectric effect. Keep in mind, I just read a bit about this and combined it with previous knowledge I knew about quantum computing. I may be wrong. "},

There are entire websites, notably one called e621, dedicated to furry porn. Thing is, furries are often into very strange sexual fetishes, two of the most well-known being vore (eating furries in a very cartoonish fashion) and inflation (inflating their bellies, breasts, or butts like balloons).\n\nAnd then of course there's just genuinely cringeworthy furries. Mostly in the form of young people (12-14) on DeviantART, they make very unoriginal furry characters (often black/red wolves), speak in a very \"LEL RANDOM\" fashion, and post videos that are nothing but [animations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O83gP56l3I) of their favorite scenes from various things or emo songs with their characters.

{"title":"ELI5: Why isn't the ocean boiling??","question_detail":"Water turns to steam around 212f at sea level, right?  Wouldn't that mean for evaporation to happen the surface temp of the ocean would have to be around 212, no?","answer":"In order for water to turn from liquid into vapor, it needs to have enough energy to break bonds that are present in the liquid water but not present in gaseous water (or water vapor)  This can happen in multiple ways. \n\nIn boiling, heat is added to the point where many molecules have enough energy to break those bonds.  In this case bubbles of water vapor form and that vapor then rises to the surface and is released as steam.  \n\nEvaporation is kind of like a very very slow cousin of boiling.  Under normal conditions, water molecules can, from time to time collect enough energy to escape into the air.  The rate at which water evaporates depends on multiple factors, but generally speaking, hotter, windier conditions cause faster evaporation.  \n\nHeat helps because the hotter it is the more energy each molecule has.  Wind helps because as soon as a molecule escapes into the air, it has the chance to be reabsorbed.  Wind moves away newly escaped molecules before this can happen.  "},

{"title":"ELI5: How does a secured credit card work?","answer":"Its pretty straightforward: because the bank doesn't trust you enough to supply credit of their own, they offer you the chance to obtain \"credit\" through a collateral system. Every month you put up a specific amount of money to be held by the bank. The amount of money you put up determines the \"credit\" you are allowed that month; any purchases you make are taken out of the money you put up. Once you've run out of credit you must refill it ay the beginning of the following month. If you decide to not put up more money, you get no more credit."},

The harness has a relay and an in-line fuse. Last night, the wire harness caught on fire and the relay erupted into flames. I put it out with a fire extinguisher. What is an electrical short in a vehicle and why does it cause a fire?  Thank you.","answer":"Wires are a conductor but they also have a resistance.  When a resistor impedes the electrical current it gets hot.  If it's not large enough to handle the amount of current you are pushing through it, it will get REALLY hot.  Plastic wire insulation, carpet or anything else touching that resistor can potentially catch fire if it gets hot enough.\n\nNow, the fact that this happened and your fuse didn't blow means that either your wire gauge is too low, or your fuse is too big.  A larger gauge wire can take more current, a smaller fuse would break before it let your wire catch something on fire.\n\nEDIT: Words"},

{"title":"ELI5:jesus","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"/u/g3t_re4l \n\nAccording to Islam, Jesus(pbuh) was a Prophet of God(swt). All the Prophets(pbut) that were sent by God all had the same message, that God is alone and one, and has no partners, sons, brothers etc. Also, Prophets(pbut) used to come, when the people used to deviate away from God, and their job was to give advice and bring people back to God. \n\nWith regards to Christianity, and Jesus(pbuh), Islam doesn't place any importance in the New Testament, for multiple reasons. \n\n1) The Quran was sent to us with all the rules pertaining to us, and the Prophet(pbuh) explained and expounded on those rules (recorded in the Hadith). So therefore we have no reason to look else where for any teachings.\n\n2) Even though Jesus(pbuh) is a very highly respected Prophet, and we accept Jesus(pbuh), we don't follow his teachings because the Prophet Muhammad's(saw) teachings are what has been prescribed for us and for all of mankind. Any other teachings that were there before, even if they were valid and in their original form, are to be placed aside and have preference for the Quran and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad(pbuh), the last and final Prophet.\n\n3) The Bible given to Jesus(pbuh) was a valid book, but has since been altered and the original Bible not available. Therefore no one can vouch for the validity of this text, including the early Greek manuscripts, which are translations themselves. There may be valid text still present, but due to the lack of original Bible texts, there is no way to verify. Therefore Muslims don't take anything from the Bible. \n\nAs for learning about Jesus(pbuh) as a Prophet, all Muslims are taught about Jesus(pbuh), his miraculous birth, and his life story. We all regard him highly, one of the greatest Prophets to have existed, and further, we know that he will return towards the end of time. We also understand that he will come to break the cross, meaning to expel the notion that Jesus(pbuh) is God's son and set the record straight that he is just a Prophet. He will also follow the way of the Prophet Muhammad(pbuh).\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: If each episode of a cartoon like Steven Universe takes 9 months to make, how do they get so many episodes done in a year?","question_detail":"I just can't wrap my mind around this. Is there someone in the animation industry who can tell me a typical timeline for the production of a cartoon?","answer":"Just because it takes 9 months to make doesn't mean that *every* employee is working on each episode for a full 9 months.  Think of it like an assembly line - it might take an hour to build a car (no idea what the real time is), but that doesn't mean that 50 people are building the car, then all start a new one.  A few guys start it, then pass it to the next team while they start a new one.\n\nSo the animation process goes something like this:\n\n* Writing\n* Storyboarding\n* Animating\n* Voiceover and Sound\n* Editing\n\nEach of those teams will be working on different things at different times.  The animators might be working on 3 episodes while the writing staff is still writing the next 3 episodes, and the actors are recording their voice actors for the 3 episodes before that.  The whole process takes 9 months, but since different people are doing different things throughout, you can get through the whole season in a year or less."},

It's not like a 40th of the county buys a car there.","answer":"Having a lot of cars makes it seem like the dealership is very successful and can offer many options.

{"title":"Eli5: what is the 'hungry' feeling we get when we're, well, hungry?","question_detail":"[deleted]","answer":"Depends on what you define as hungry. Your body gets used to eating on a certain schedule, and when it's time to eat your brain sends signals that stimulate the release of various enzymes used for digestion and related actions. Having gastrin and other pancreatic enzymes in the stomach gets things churning, which makes you feel what people describe as hunger. What you're \"feeling\" is the flaps that grind food in your stomach starting to grind with no food to be ground as well as the increased level of acid released.\n\nIf you wait a few hours after this feeling, the body will chill out and stop the internal machinations. The second kind of hunger comes later once everything you've eaten has been digested and your body begins to use its fuel reserves of glucose, fat, and finally muscle as energy. What you're feeling as I understand it is mostly a neurological reception of a still empty stomach and your brain urgently telling you to eat by emulating physical pain."},
{"title":"ELI5: Can we know for curtain that big lottery companies actually have X amount of winning tickets?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"If you are taking about pick-six kinds of games, they don't have an incentive to underreport the number of winning tickets. If they say only two were sold when it was really three, then that will quickly be refuted when the third winner steps forward.  Even if they say that three winners  were sold when it was really only two, and they use they as an excuse to pay the two winners less, it's not a good long-term scam because people will start getting suspicious of a large number of unclaimed awards."},
{"title":"ELI5: How come minimum wage doesn't increase respectively to cost of living?","question_detail":"Hmm?","answer":"Because many of your politicians believe that by raising the minimum wage everything will get equally more expensive, cancelling out any gains and that the only thing that actually goes up are expenses and taxes. Obviously this isn't true and if you'd like I can explain that as well. Most of your politicians believe that it's better to create a work environment where employers voluntarily pay more for quality employees and have more jobs available creating competition for top employees. While this works for fancy office jobs that require a proper education (eg Engineering, a \"Musical Theory and Race Relations\" major doesn't count) for most things that don't require special education or training this doesn't hold. Companies will just go with the cheapest person who can do the job and not complain. The theory that wealth trickles down works well in theory, but then again so does communism and wankel rotary engines."},
{"title":"ELI5: How can I determine if my ISP is doing what they say they are or if they are doing it well.","question_detail":"I know a little about on peak and off peak but have been very suspicious of late.  Be it normal usage or a stress test, is there any way to accurately tell?","answer":"It is a really hard problem. I am fairly certain I will fail to ELI5. Basically you can't.\n\nThe issue stems from several points:\n\n* Networking performance is something that isn't stable - look at traffic jams - depending on hour, the route, the period of the year (annual holidays departure)\n* A networking test only prove that the connexion issue is there between two points, it doesn't prove anything for every other points. It is not because you had to take a deviation to go from A to B that you will have to take it too for going from A to C\n* ISPs are using something called QoS. Quality of Service means that some information flux are prioritary. Like an ambulance, you let it pass. Especially the so-called \"speedtest\". Hence those are only a measure of what your ISP will output in optimal conditions. It's like saying you can go at the speed limit on the road. Not really accurate, is it ?\n* There is a bloat of others technical reasons I won't start to talk about to keep it simple. Suffice to say that some traffic lights work better than others, border control can make you wait at the customs or that you can get lost and just have to redo all the road again."},
{"title":"ELI5 Are energy harvesting roads a real thing?","answer":"So since you seem to be talking about a piezoelectric method instead of the solar roadway thing that was popular a few months back (which in theory *could* work even though it isn't really wise) this one is in fact taking energy from the cars. The thing about these \"sensors\" which they are using to create electricity is that they don't simply produce power by having weight on them. They make it because they deform when weight is put on them. As soon as it has finished deforming it will stop producing. As someone pointed out, if they made it just by having weight on them we could simply make these and then put a bunch of rocks on them for our power plants.\n\nThe reason this takes energy from the cars is that when we compare the section of road that a car is on to the bit just in front of it, because the sensors it is sitting on got ever so slightly squeezed, that bit of road will be ever so slightly lower than the section right in front of the car, and as such it will take every so slightly more energy (in this case the energy from gasoline) to lift that car onto the next sensor. The amount that it slows the car might not even be measurable by your instruments, but the amount of energy you get from each car is also very very small. Think about walking on a trampoline. Since you are pushing the spot you are on down, no matter which way you walk, it's just a bit up hill.\n\nBasically you are crowd sourcing power generation. You could totally argue that this is fine, and that the tiny amount of extra gas used is the cost of using the road, with all its lights and signs and such. You could argue that it has such a low impact on each individual that although it is *technically* taking their energy, it is *practically* free. You could also say that using someone else's energy without telling them, and instead implying that the energy is free, is a way of duping them regardless of the amounts at hand. \n\nI won't make a judgment about which of the above views is correct, but I will say that *practically*, there are much more cost effective ways to crowd source energy. For one you could just tax the people who use the road and then buy some electricity with that money, which we do. Or make it a toll road, and buy the power with that money. Or just use whatever money you were planning on using to tear up the roads and install this system to instead by some solar panels and batteries. In that case the energy itself pretty much would be free.\n\nTL:DR: It would take a tiny amount of energy from each car. You can say this ok, or not. Regardless, there are most likely cheaper and easier alternatives."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why do some people think that Christianity is under attack in the United States?","question_detail":"[deleted]","answer":"Long story short: Christianity is losing a place of privilege that it probably never was entitled to.

I'm pretty active in atheist communities and there is a universal recognition among those I associate with that religious freedom protects the interests of both the religious and the nonreligious and is a critical component of civilized society."},

The player also takes a risk, in that they might outperform their contract, and be stuck with less money.\n\nRemember, it is a profession first, and a game second.

{"title":"ELI5: Why can't we produce a zero calorie beer?","question_detail":"[deleted]","answer":"Alcohol is fermented sugar, and sugar is one of the most calorific things in existence. The calories are an integral part of the makeup of the alcohol, so they can't be removed without rendering the beer completely non-alcoholic.\n\nAn interesting side-note, though: there is a drug named Bretazenil (more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretazenil)) which has been suggested by David Nutt, former drug advisor to the government, as a base for a new social drug.\n\nIt is a benzodiazepine (like Valium) and has most of the same intoxicating properties as alcohol, but very few of the same side-effects, and of course it is calorie-free. So perhaps in the future, it will be possible to get \"drunk\" without as many calories; but of course, it will likely never be a beer, per se. If anything, it'll be a solution of bretazenil in non-alcoholic beer (which still has calories, just far fewer than normal beer)."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why do houses have a crawl space but apartments and townhouses don't?","question_detail":"Every house I've ever been in (without a basement) has had at least some space between the bottom floor and the foundation, but apartments on the ground floor and townhouses have concrete directly under the floor. Why is that?","answer":"Depends on where you live. Homes in the Midwest often are built on top of a monolithic concrete slabs where there is no crawlspace. Houses on the west coast tend to be built on pier and beam, because earthquakes tend to crack concrete slabs.\n\nA slab is cheaper and easier to build upon, but access to buried water, sewer, HVAC, and electrical requires expensive foundation work. By then the builder is long gone.  Pier and beam allows for easier access, better ventilation of the subfloor. \n\nAs for why multi-story apartments don't have a crawl space, mostly because the structure is supporting a lot of weight, and construction techniques are different. I've seen a few 3 story apartments with a crawlspace, but rare. Plus controlling access to the crawl space is an issue in multi-occupant dwellings. "},

Here is how you calculate interest for one month:\n\n$2,500 x 23% = $575\nThis is the total interest for the year if you had a constant balance of $2,500.\n\nSince you only want one months worth simply:\n\n$575 x 1/12 = $47.92\n\nThis is the interest for one month.

{"title":"ELI5: Why are most spicy foods non-spicy at first, but then really spicy after chewing and swallowing - but, eating more removes the spicy sensation entirely.","question_detail":"This happens with my favorite bag of jalapeno chips all the time. I eat ONE chip and stop, then my mouth is on fire almost immediately. But if I continue eating chips, it's not so spicy.","answer":"The reason it takes a few seconds before you start feeling the heat is because it takes a bit of time for capsaicin, the ingredient in peppers and other foods that causes the heat sensation, to interact with a certain receptor in your mouth (TrpV1) that then sends a signal to your brain telling you \"this food is spicy\". \n\nThe reason eating more temporarily blocks the sensation is because of something called the gate control theory of pain. Ever get hit really hard then start rubbing the spot profusely and it seems to go away? What's happening is several signals are being sent to the brain from the spot that hurts, one painful and one not. The gate control theory states that the brain temporarily blocks the painful signal while the other is being sent, hence giving you that temporary relief. \n\nThe same applies to spicy foods. Before you're able to receive the \"this food is hot\" signal, your brain prioritizes the \"there is a new food/texture in my mouth\" signal. "},

The most common and de facto official definition is \"a group of animals with similar characteristics that can interbreed\".\n\nBut people often took characteristic uniqueness to be more important.\n\nThis lead to the creation of several different species of canine, Canis Lupus (wolves), Canis Latrans (coyotes) and several species of jackal. Mostly because of geographic isolation and physical differences.\n\nYet the majority of these species can interbreed. Coyotes and wolves rarely interbreed naturally because they are competitors and don't usually share territory. But coyotes and dogs have been recorded to breed for centuries in the Americas.\n\nSimilarly different bear species can interbreed. Recent Arctic melting has forced Polar bears and grizzlies into common territory and Pizzly/Grolar bears are the result. Even though Polar bears are Ursus maritimus and Brown bear are Ursus Arctos.\n\nI've never heard of hybridization as far up as family.

{"title":"ELI5: Why is it so difficult to find the direct cause for a Migraine?","question_detail":"I had a terrible Migraine today so I did some research. I found that there are several theories. What makes these theories so hard to test to find a direct cause?","answer":"There are several factors when it comes to testing on humans that makes most research difficult. First, humans are difficult to test with, you cant just put them in a room and wait for a migraine to occur and then start running tests. Well you could, but the cost to pay a person for that would just be too much. Secondly migraines can be induced, with that, researchers can look at how migraines work and see the process that occurs. But they know the source, its the drug they used, so this only helps with the end but not the beginning. Another problem is testing samples. You can test blood, but blood tells you what messenger chemicals are circulating, and the excess chemicals and proteins in the body. This can tell you much, but it doesn't tell you what's going on in a specific body part or organ. To get the rest of the story you can test specific tissues by taking a sample and running experiments to see whats going on with those cells. But would you let someone take a piece of your brain. This is probably the biggest problem with finding out how migraines work, people don't want their heads cut open. Even if a researcher was able to get all of the above lined up, migraines might not be one thing going on. It could be 3 or 4 things going wrong, which means even if they find one definitive process of a migraine and make a treatment. The treatment might not work because its not getting everything. Most medications are trial and error and when they find a chemical that fixes something researches might have no idea why it does what it does. Its only recently that we have begun engineering medications to fix specific   ailments. Eventually we'll get it figured out, but like most mysteries the technology just hasn't been invented that'll reveal the source.\n\nTLDR: Humans are expensive and difficult to work with. Brains are really difficult to test. And basically we know much less than we want to believe."},

{"title":"ELI5: why are copic markers so expensive?","answer":"As with everything, markers have a range in terms of quality and usefulness. If you're giving markers to your 5 yr old to draw, you don't need Copic markers. If you're an artist who makes their living with markers, then Copic markers are one of the best, if not *the* best, choices out there. Copic markers share some similar qualities with paint: they blend well, they don't bleed, and they go down very smoothly. You cannot say this about all, or even most markers. You can achieve shading and effects with Copic markers that you simply won't get with other markers. \n\nAnother key element is that most of their line is reusable.

{"title":"ELI5: How does electromagnetic induction work? How can a magnetic field be transformed into an electrical signal?","answer":"Magnetic fields are caused by moving charges. And it works the other way too—a magnetic field will impart a force onto a moving charge. Or if the magnetic field is changing. \n\nWhat's a wire made of? Metal. With atoms that have electrons that are (sort of) free to move around. They're charges too, so they'll feel a force. The force causes the electrons to move, and that's what causes the current to flow.\n\nTo be more concrete, EMF is inducted when there is a change in flux (magnetic field perpendicular to surface plane) over time. The equation is -N(for loops) delta-phi / delta-time. \n\nSo one wire will induce a varying magnetic field, and that magnetic field will induce a EMF in the other wire.\n"},

It's just a consequence of having most scientific discoveries happen in the Northern Hemisphere; the \"top\" of the world.\n\nHaving said this, direction isn't completely arbitrary. We're either right side up or upside down. Other co-ordinates in space are generally considered to be in the 'ecliptic plane' (the area where the planets orbit) or the 'galactic plane' (where most of the stars are).\n\nIt all depends on where you take your spatial cues from - what are your points of reference?

{"title":"ELI5: Do batteries still have voltages when they are depleted of energy?","question_detail":"So we just started circuits in my physics class today, pretty basic stuff. But, I was wondering, as the title suggests, if batteries still have a voltage when they are depleted of energy. What confuses me is how batteries don't supply charge to a circuit, rather, energy, but, if voltage is really just a change in potential energy, does it always maintain the same amount of volts? What does this mean when you recharge a battery? Lots of questions, but any help would be appreciated. Thanks!\n","answer":"Batteries use a redox reaction to keep up an electron gradient - a voltage. The positive side's electrons move to the negative side (positive gets oxidized, negative gets reduced). Thus, when the redox reaction cuts out, the battery is \"dead\" as it can't provide the gradient anymore. For those rechargeable batteries, they are designed to have reversible batteries; you are resetting the redox reaction when you charge a rechargeable battery.\n\nNote: this is about those AAA, AA, D, etc. batteries. Li-ion batteries are a bit different. "},

Crates contain skins. You purchase keys to open crates in game. You can trade these skins or sell them on the steam market.\n\nFor most sites, you enter skins you're willing to bet. Your skins are put into a pot with other people betting. Your chance of winning is proportional to the value of of the skins you put in the pot if you were to sell them on the marketplace roughly. These pots last about a minute or two before a winner is chosen. Them a fresh pot starts and the process repeats. \n\nThe website acts as an intermediate for when you enter your skins you offer a steam trade to a bot account. If you win the bot sends you a trade offer with all the skins you won in that pot. Open steam back up and accept it and when you open CSGO you'll see your fresh skins which you could sell, use, or gamble with again. \n\nSkin gambling is just a way for people to have fun with garbage skins that would not sell for much or they don't use.

","answer":"Arguably, Darwin's finches can be thought of as different species in the process of speciation; they have noticeable differences physically and behaviorally, such as certain song and breeding patterns. Because these cause the different species to feed on different foods and mate with certain birds, they're considered different species.\n\nHumans aren't classified as different species because most of our physical differences are largely superficial and behavioral differences/eating patterns can be attributed more to culture and less to inherent genes.

{"title":"ELI5: How is the middle class able to shrink?","question_detail":"Would the 'middle class' not be defined as the middle 10, 20, or 50% of Americans and therefore always be the same size?  \nHow is it defined now?","answer":"Classes are generally divided into four broad categories:\n\n- The \"Upper class\"; which doesn't need to work for a living. Nobles in old times; business owners, senior management, etc. in modern times. The lower levels of the Upper Class manage people, but they aren't \"working\"; they're \"Managing\" (though since the 1960s; there are \"Middle managers\"; who aren't upper class).\n- The \"Middle Class\"; people who work for a living based on investments in themselves: high-skilled labor, small business owners, middle managers (who manage based on education, rather than based on connections), etc. Historically, this was the \"Merchant class\"; occupied by wealthy merchants and guildmasters.\n- the \"Working class\"; people who work for a living, often with their hands, but there's a lot of working class jobs that are based on college degrees now.\n- The \"Poor\": people who aren't making a living, either because they don't work; or in more recent times, because the job(s) they have don't pay the bills.\n\nThe main difference is the experience of each class. The wealthy tend to be immune to even extreme economic failures: only drastic failures like the Great Depression cause them any problems. The working class, on the other hand, tend to be very depending on economic conditions. The Middle class can weather normal economic disruption, and only runs into serious problems in larger or longer economic disruption: the Dot-Bomb was a minor setback for the Middle Class, but the recent credit crisis/mortgage bubble/recession did hit the middle class.\n\nA smaller middle class means that more people are economically vulnerable; meaning that smaller economic setbacks will be enough to cause large problems. This wasn't an issue historically because there weren't as many poor: even people who weren't well off could at least take care of themselves."},

{"title":"ELI5: why does cold water seemingly quench your thirst faster but lukewarm water hydrates you quicker?","question_detail":"I know you become thirsty when your body feels dehydrated so why is it that your body responds better to cold water when lukewarm water is more efficient for the bodies needs?","answer":"It's harder for your body to digest cold water because it takes energy to warm it up. Luke warm water can go to vital organs faster cause it's good to go. \n\nHowever, if you're exerting energy, it's better to drink cold water. Your body will already be over heated and cold water helps regulate your overall body temp.\n\nThe body prefers cooler water because of the temperature change it creates."},
{"title":"ELI5:For years they told that the economy was tied to oil then the oil price plummeted and instead of that stimulating economy, economies plummeted. Is there a relation?","answer":"For countries without oil, oil is an expense because it needs to be imported. So cheaper oil frees up money for other things. More expensive oil means less money for other things. Effects are fairly marginal usually.\n\nFor countries with their own oil, oil is a source of income. Increasing oil prices means more income, low oil prices means less income (and more unemployment).\n\nIt doesn't help when some countries (especially third world) have oil as nearly the only source of government income. They barely levy any taxes, which means that when the oil price drops you're screwed. You can't set up a new taxation system in a year. It takes decades for sales/income tax collection to become efficient."},

{"title":"ELI5: How does anti-virus software identify particular lines of code?","question_detail":"[deleted]","answer":"I think you're mixing a lot of terms here. \n\nAV software doesn't look at \"code\" if you're using code to mean what most people do today, i.e., source code. You don't have source code for programs on your computer, you have the executable. And you can't really get the source code back from that, so there's nothing for you to throw into a compiler - which doesn't matter, since it's already compiled. \n\nAnti-virus software doesn't work on the assembler level, either. They know what the compiled virus looks like, and simply look for that signature in the appropriate kind of file. It's like looking for a string of text in a text document, except looking for a binary (or, more likely, hexadecimal) string in an executable file. \n\nThis is why your AV is always updating it's definitions file. That's where it stores the virus signatures. "},

I know it involves racial segregation and famously occurred in South Africa but I know there's more to it as a general concept? Was racial segregation in the U.S. a form of Apartheid? ","answer":"Good information so far, but the key difference between an apartheid regime and one of mere segregation is that in apartheid segregation is the official policy of the State. Not a mere cultural separation, not private discrimination, not even discrimination by government officials abusing their office. But that enforcement of the letter of the law requires racial/ethnic segregation and discrimination.\n\nThis was true in the American South under Jim Crow, where it was, for example, actually illegal for blacks to sit in the front of a bus, drink from a whites-only water fountain, or even be present in certain towns after dark. Black people who violated these prima facile discriminatory laws were arrested and jailed. (They were also murdered extrajudicially at high rates, and these murders were frequently never investigated or prosecuted, even though white police may well have been part of the lynch mob.)\n\nUnder this definition it's probably not true in Israel proper, although the case can be made that it is true in the Occupied Territories. Certainly if there isn't a dramatic policy shift in the next couple decades, Israel will become a indisputable apartheid state, because the Arab population of Israel is growing faster than the Jewish."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why does a loss of blood flow cause numbness","question_detail":"I don't know that much biology, but shouldn't the circulatory and neural systems be separate?","answer":"Nerve cells require a continuous flow of nutrients, especially Ca2+ and Na+ ions in order to properly function. Nerve signal transduction depends on the nerve cell being able to route a wave of depolarization across the length of the axon. Without the vital nutrients and oxygen that fresh blood supplies, the electrical gradient can't be produced, resulting in no signal being sent to the brain. Your body interprets this lack of signal as numbness. You can try this out on your own by pressing against the large artery on the inside of your upper arm. After a few minutes you'll notice a drop in the sensation of your entire limb, which is due to your nerve cells not having fresh nutrients. So, essentially, you experience numbness because you're starving your nerve cells and that prevents them from sending signals to your brain. \n\n"},

It just seems so strange to me that a plant is fluffy like cotton is, and I don't really know why. In fact, I don't really know of any other plants that are quite like this. Can someone please explain this too me? Sheep I understand their fluffiness, it's like hair, but cotton!? It's a mystery to me.\n\nThanks!","answer":"It's for seed dispersal - like many plants it grows a long filament to catch the wind. Cotton has been bred over thousands of years to produce a particularly long staple - far longer than it would have managed in the wild, almost certainly."},

{"title":"Eli5: How is that PCs and Laptops require hefty active cooling, yet phone and tablets do not, despite performing many of the same basic functions?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"Firstly, PC's and laptop use more to power run. The more power something uses the hotter it gets (note: your phone usually heats up when being charged right? Same thing there, it is getting a lot of power to store in a relatively short time; such that, a comparison to a bolt of lightning is warranted. Lightning releases so much power in such a short amount of time that is crazy hot, hot enough to melt sand and turn it to glass).\n\nSecondly, they use more power because of the equipment used in them. Generally the processors are more robust which require more power, the video cards, and hdds. Funny thing about electricity is that it tends to heat up whatever is conducting it. And when conductors get hotter, they become less conductive and as a result want to heat up even more. It's a vicious cycle.\n\nAs far as tablets and phones not heating up, they actually do (quite a lot compared to phones and tablets of just a few years ago) but just not as much because their processors and storage are generally less powerful and therefore require less energy to run, thereby less heat being generated. Another way they keep energy usage down is by their storage devices, ssd's (solid state devices, such as the storage in phones and tablets) don't have any moving parts and need a lot less energy to run because of it (and because of the properties of ssd's that can get technical real quick, I don't know of a \"laymen\" way to explain it to you ).\n\nPhones and tablets are a lot less powerful and considerably slower than PC's and laptops, as a result they need less power to run for a given duration. Which you should by now realize translates into less heat. Energy can neither be created or destroyed, it just transforms into another type and in electronics it is heat. A superconductor, a conductor that is more or less able to transfer electricity perfectly without any loss (heat), are experimented with all the time. Unfortunately, the only way we know how to make superconductors is taking a regular conductor and getting it really cold, like with liquid nitrogen ( something else that is fun to look is quantum locking, super cooling magnets. The science behind is really cool, search for it on youtube).\n\nSo basically, the more powerful the electronics the more you need to worry about keeping them cool.\n\nEDIT: Yes, they can perform the same basic functions but just slower. Though some tablets and phones are pretty powerful, it comes at a price. The materials used to increase power in a phone and tablet so that heat isn't increasing to much are expensive. But for PC's and laptops, space isn't at such a premium. "},

{"title":"ELI5: What's the difference between a fastball, 2-seam fastball, and a 4-seam fastball.","answer":"The 2 seam fastball looks different from the batter's perspective. The irregular pattern of the seam rotation gives an optical illusion that may be interpreted as movement or just cause confusion. It is going to sink (from gravity) a tiny bit more than the four seamer, which overcomes a bit of the inevitable sinking due to air pressure effect and may seem to \"rise\" though it is in fact simply sinking less.\n\nDepending on arm angle and other variables, a pitcher might get some actual baby-slider movement on the 2 seamer while the 4 is normally straight.\n\nTypically (all other things being equal and they never are) a 4 seamer, held perpendicular to the seams at the area of widest separation of the seams, will have slightly more velocity.\n\nThere are two ways of holding a 2 seamer, across and along (usually) the narrowest approach point of the seams; but held across those 2 seams with the fingertips on the forward seam, particularly if there is irregularity of the ball such as a scuff or applied liquid and thrown from a very high overhead angle with a pronounced downward flip so the ball \"slips\" off the tips of the fingers, you can get a significant left-or-right break depending on which side you let it slip off and (in degree of break) the nature of the ball irregularity.\n\nI used to have a great pitching practice moving fastball this way, with the old worn out baseballs, that would amaze people, particularly since I could mimic the otherwise very difficult to throw screwball, with some pace.But of course it never worked very well at all in games because the baseballs tended to be newer and more pristine. "},
{"title":"ELI5:Why are formulas that explain complicated things so simple? What's so special about multiplication, division, etc. E.g. E = MC^2","answer":"I think there are a few reasons for this\n\nOne is a bit of selection bias. E=mc^(2) or e^(i pi) + 1 = 0 is punchy and easy to remember, so they get talked about more. The Braginskii equations are noticeably less simple, and sure enough they don't get talked about much outside of plasma physics.\n\nAnother is that for very important concept, new notation is developed to let them be represented simply. Maxwell's equations are an excellent example of this. You've probably seen them written compactly with that fancy upside-down triangle. What you might not know is that that upside-down triangle stands for something pretty complicated. It also didn't exist when Maxwell compiled the equations, meaning he wrote them out in a considerably more complicated form (See the leftmost column of equations on [page two of this document](http://www.zpenergy.com/downloads/Orig_maxwell_equations.pdf).) Because of the importance of these vector operators, a compact way of writing them was created.\n\nThe third reason is that math is just really good at describing scientific concepts. For example, the vector notation seen in Maxwell's equations is widely applicable in other parts of physics--it's all over fluid dynamics. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unreasonable_Effectiveness_of_Mathematics_in_the_Natural_Sciences) for a longer discussion of this."},

This makes no sense because downloads are not limited like physical copies of books are.","answer":"Publishers have more control over electronic books than they do over physical book. Copyright can't restrict a lawful owner from lending out a book, but they can make this part of the license agreement for a software-based book. On the other hand, unlike physical books, it is trivial to copy software. Copyright was not really designed for a situation where the reader can easily share books with everyone; it was designed to limit publishers from abusing authors--but that's the system we've got to work with.\n\nLibraries resolve this by making agreements with the publisher only to allow a certain number of loaned-out digital copies at a time.

We needed a craft capable of keeping people alive in the vacuum of space, but that had already been done, it just needed to be more reliable and be able to propel itself back from the moon. We needed to be able to calculate the trajectories and etc to actually get the craft where we wanted which is fairly complex, but we've been able to do that math since the 1600s. IT wanted some fairly advanced computers, but we'd been working on that since 1940s. \n\n\nSo on and so forth.

{"title":"ELI5: why are there so many more 'simple' medical procedures available for humans than there are for animals?","question_detail":"I am not sure if the answer is more about lack of willingness or lack of resources...\n\nI mean stuff like;\nSay a person was hit by a car and had some internal organ damage. For a human that requires bed rest and maybe some minor surgery. For a cat/dog, it requires euthenasia, why? \nIn the same vein, if a person becomes paralysed e.g. from the waist down, they get a wheelchair. An animal gets death? Where are all the kitty wheelchairs?\n\nI understand not operating on an old animal, in the same way an old person might sign a DNR, but why are so many young animals put to sleep for relatively small things? Maybe the vets of reddit can shed some light :)\n\nI ask because my 1yo cat was hit by a car in April, something must have severed spinally because both back legs were paralysed but apart from that no other external or internal injuries. We had to have him put down :( RIP Strider.","answer":"Not a vet, but work with animals, and sometimes with vets. Best guess? \n\nA large chunk of the reason is financial. There's not a whole lot of insurance for animals, and the bill can quickly run into the tens of thousands of dollars, which the owner may be unable to pay. And for non-pet animals, the decision is usually mostly financial. \n\nA second reason is that because most pets are smaller, their injuries are comparatively worse and more difficult to work on. Also, in some situations they are just way worse off, like your specific example of getting hit by a car: if a person gets hit by a car, the bumper usually hits them in the legs, and then their body rolls up onto the hood of the car, whereas the bumper would hit a dog in the head and body, where all of the important bits are.\n\nAnother reason is that animals can't be made to comply with treatment or recovery protocols, so in situations where those are crucial, animals are at a major disadvantage. They won't stay off broken legs, they'll try to run away and tear internal stitches, etc. This can make the prognosis for recovery very poor, in some cases to the point of near impossibility.\n\nAlso, for some weird reason, we seem to to care more about quality of life for pets, and length of life for people. So people will see their pets have a poor prognosis, decide they don't want them to suffer, and opt to put then down rather than resort to heroic measures, but the same isn't true for people, where most seem to care more about whether a person will survive rather than what their quality of life will be if they do.

{"title":"ELI5 How is IQ calculated?","answer":"Through statistics.\n\nAdminister a standardized IQ test to a group of people that's representative of the population.\n\nLet's say the max score on the test is 100, and on average people score 50/100. Through statistical analysis, you then test it against a normal distribution (to make sure the Bell curve model is valid). Then you use standard deviations to calculate the IQ.\n\nLet's say the standard deviation for this test is 10/100. So if you score 50 (the average), you have an IQ of 100. If you score 60, then you have an IQ of 115 or 116 (depending on the scale of the IQ test being used). Furthermore:\n\n- 70 = 130-132 IQ\n\n- 80 = 145-148 IQ\n\n- 90 = 160-164 IQ\n\n- 100 = 175-180 IQ\n\nIQ represents how rare you are in a population:\n\n- 68.3% of the population score between 40 and 60 (85-115 IQ)\n\n- 95.4% of the population score between 30 and 70 (70-130 IQ). Therefore, if you have an IQ of 130, there are only 2.3% of the population who scored higher than you. (1 in 44; generally the smartest in a class has 130+ IQ).\n\n- 99.7% of the population score between 20 and 80 (55-145 IQ). At 145 IQ, only 0.15% of the population score higher than you. (1 in 740; generally the smartest in a whole school has 145+ IQ).\n\n- 99.99% of the population score between 10 and 90 (40-160 IQ). At 160 IQ, only 0.005% of the population score higher than you. (1 in 31574; definitely one of the smartest in a whole university).\n\n- 99.9999% of the population score between 0 and 100 (25-175 IQ). At 175 IQ, only 0.00005% of the population score higher than you. (1 in 3.5 million; likely the smartest in a whole big city).\n\nOfficial IQ tests usually max out around 180ish IQ due to it being very hard to get a test that can measure 10 standard deviations (up/down from the mean). For example, most exams at school have around 15% standard deviation, and an average of 70%, so if you score 100, at best you're 2 SD above average - it's practically impossible to get 5 SD above average, unless it's a very well designed test."},

If your seat has an ashtray, chances are it's an older seat and the plane itself is older. Ashtrays are always going to be installed on aircraft, normally in the lavatories. This is done in order to provide a safe place for a cigarette to be extinguished should a passenger decide to break the law (yes, it's a law) and light a cigarette onboard.

In addition you have the solar radiation that pushes on the spacecraft, and the atmospheric drag  if you are in a relativly low orbit around one of the planets that have a significant atmosphere, and the interactions with the magnetic fields that can depending on the spacecraft create forces on it.\n\nEdit: and i think you mean propellant (fuel) not propeller (the thing in front of old planes that pulls them through air)"},

{"title":"ELI5: How does adding one proton to an atom completely change its behavior?","question_detail":"[deleted]","answer":"The behavior that you're looking at is chemistry.  Chemistry is almost entirely governed by how the electrons of one atom interact with the electrons of another atom.  There are certain arrangements of electrons that are very stable, while other arrangements are unstable—it takes a lot of energy to get to that state and you get a lot of energy out when you leave that state.  Often one of the least stable states is very very close to one of the most stable ones.\n\nThe number of electrons that an atom has is proportional to the number of protons it has.  Protons are positively charged, so they attract negatively charged electrons.\n\nWhen you add or remove one proton you change the number of electrons that want to hang out around that atom, and oftentimes you'll take an atom that was very chemically stable (e.g. Neon) and change it into one that is very unstable (e.g. Fluorine or Sodium), or vice versa.

{"title":"ELI5: How do cassette tapes work, and how do cassette players produce the audio?","answer":"Basically, the tape inside the cassette is magnetisable. Using some electronic wizardry and an effect in the tape known as bias (outside the scope of an ELI5), a magnetic version of the sound wave is captured onto the now magnetised tape. \n\nA magnet has north and south poles, and can be spun to point somewhere in between (like a magnetic compass). Think of using that effect (a compass needle moving like the needle of an old analogue sound meter) to record a sound wave on a magnetic tape. \n\nThen, to play it back, a different magnetic head is used that is sensitive to the magnetised information on the tape that in turn recreates the sound wave. \n\nOld cassette tapes are analogue, meaning an actual physical representation of the sound wave is stored on the tape. \n\nDigital tapes to exist (such as DAT) that uses the north and south poles to represent digital 0s and 1s, but they never became popular with consumers as CDs came out around the same time.

{"title":"ELI5: The Fourier Transform, Discrete Fourier Transform, and FFT frequency bin sizes","question_detail":"I understand the concept of the Fourier Transform and what it does, but I can't wrap my head around why there is a frequency resolution when moving to the DFT. I understand the bin sizes are inversely proportional to time sampled, but why? Can someone give me an intuitive explanation on this?","answer":"&gt;&gt;why there is a frequency resolution when moving to the DFT\n\nIt's all to do with the sampling rate. Take something with a constant frequency - a sin wave for instance. In order to be able to work out the frequency of this sin wave, you need to [sample it enough](http://www.scratchapixel.com/old/assets/Uploads/Continuous%20to%20Digital/cd-sampling1.png?) that you can make out the shape (and hence the frequency) of the wave. If you don't sample it enough, then [when you try to work out what the wave looks like from just your points](http://image.slidesharecdn.com/dig-150217052230-conversion-gate02/95/digital-layer-35-638.jpg?cb=1424151227) (or calculate it's frequency, like with a FT), then you don't get the correct value. The highest frequency (shortest wavelength) that you can resolve with a given sampling rate is called the Nyquist frequency. If you try sampling a frequency that's higher than the Nyquist, you don't get the correct wave form, and you might actually think it was [a different frequency.](http://www.scratchapixel.com/old/assets/Uploads/Continuous%20to%20Digital/cd-sampling5.png?)\n\nThe reason why there's a discretization is because when you transform information (say, an array of magnetometer data) into the frequency domain, you end up with the same number of points (the coefficients of the frequencies). So, the discretization of the frequency domain depends on both the time interval used for your data, as well as the total number of points of data (in fact, the frequency interval is calculated as 1/Ndt for N points space dt apart).\n\nAnother way to think about the discretization is the idea behind the Fourier Transform itself. When you transform a function into the frequency domain, you get an infinite sum of coefficients to sin and cos terms, where the sinusoidal terms tell you what frequency you're at, and the coefficient tells you how much of that frequency you have. With discretized data, you'll only be able to have as many coefficients (and hence frequency terms) as you do points of data in your function, hence there's a \"highest frequency\" limit to what you have - i.e. that's your resolution!"},

No one can speak with certainty on if our equipment can 'catch anything not yet previously encountered'. By  definition, we can't know. We do have lots of experience with keeping horrendous pathogens isolated from the outside world so we can study them, so we should be fine in that area as long as we make it a priority.\n3.

(Southern Ontario Canada just in case that's relevant)","answer":"Believe it or not, toads are pretty high on the food chain. Pretty much anything near that size will stay away from them. They're notorious for eating every damn thing that even remotely fits in their mouth. So it's not like they're fearful creatures. They're also probably out looking for mates, which is going to make them more willing to take risks.\n\nTheir size is also a bit of a liability. They can't climb like free frogs, so they're more likely to get stuck in a pool, and they can't get away quite as quickly. But by and large, if they want to hide odds are good you won't see them. Most of the time you do it's because they're looking for a mate and they're not particularly afraid of most things.\n\nAlso, depending on the species, they're probably mildly poisonous."},
{"title":"ELI5:In 2-step algebraic equations, why do you cancel out the +/- portion before the division/multiplication portion in the variable?","question_detail":"Let's say I have the equation 2x + 4 = 8. In these equations you will always cancel out the x part, in this case the 2x before canceling out the + 4. But why? I know that canceling out the 4 and subtracting it by 8 first then dealing with the 2x will get a different answer than doing it traditionally, you'd get 0, while doing it traditionally with canceling out the + 4 will get you 2. What's the reason for this though? This defies PEMDAS in that multiplication and division are done before addition or subtraction.","answer":"This doesn't defy bedmas, if follows it exactly. \n\nIF you were to solve the equation you would do multiplication first so 2 times x (what ever it is) then you would add 4 last to give you 8. \n\nTo solve for x you would work backwards from what you did. The last thing you did was add 4 to get 8 so lets undo that. 8-4 = 4 So before you added 4 you had 2x = 4. Now we can undo the 2 times to find out what x was. x = 2\n\nNow plug in the 2 you found for x and the formula is 2(2) + 4 = 8\nFollow BEDMAS and solve and you will find the equation is correct. "},

{"title":"ELI5: Why are they using rocket launcher for space vehicles,satellites etc?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"The challenge in getting into space isn't going really high.  It's going really fast.\n\nWhen you fly through the air you push off of the air and in return you get pushed forward (and up, in the case of wings).  However, the faster you go the more drag you encounter, so you need to keep applying a force from the engines to maintain speed.\n\nWhen you fly in space you bring rocket fuel along with you.  You push it in one direction and you accelerate in the other direction.  There's nothing to slow you down, so if you can apply a force for a few minutes you can wind up going several times faster than the fastest atmospheric aircraft.  Going that speed in atmosphere is incredibly difficult requiring thins like heat shields that burn up as you use them (e.g. Apollo capsules) or high tech tiles (e.g. Space Shuttle).\n\nPutting a spacecraft on an aircraft does help you some.  It gets you through part of the atmosphere and it gets you some initial speed.  It's viable for some smaller satellites, as was demonstrated by the [Pegasus orbatial launch system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus_(rocket)).  The Pegasus rocket would be carried to altitude by a Lockheed L-1011 Stargazer (a 3-engine passenger jet design, though it's modified for this purpose) then push to orbit.\n\nHowever, this launch system isn't able to handle particularly big satellites.  It can only take about 1000 lbs to orbit, while something like the Falcon 9 can carry up to 50,000 lbs and the Space Launch System under development by NASA can take up to 290,000 lbs.  These rockets are simply too big to be carried by any aircraft in existence and the added complexity of such a launch makes that approach non viable."},

When animals \"smile\" are they experiencing the same joy/happiness or is it coincidence?","answer":"No,  animals don't smile like humans do,  that's just our facial recognition software in our brain getting wrong results based on wrong input. \n\nLook at cats for example.  Their faces are far less expressive than our  human ones.  But they convey emotions differently,  with body languages,  ears,  tails and their eye movement. Cats don't laugh at jokes, fir example, so they don't have the ability to laugh.  But they tell other cats if  they tolerate them or not, and for that,  their body language is perfectly sufficient.  Cats have the equivalent of a smile,  a slow blink, but you can't apply human facial features onto animals directly. "},

Being DC i imagine this is out of an abundance of saftey. Would this same thing happen with self driving cars for the same reasons?","answer":"Metro systems do indeed have a bunch of safety precautions, but they also typically run on very tight schedules, at least during rush hour.\n\nImagine one train is slightly delayed at a station because a passenger got stuck in a door. That might delay the train by, say, 20 seconds. Further back down the line, the next train is, for safety reasons, not allowed to enter that section of line until the first train has left it -- lines are divided into sections and only one train is allowed in one section at a time. These sections have to be long enough so that a train travelling at full speed can stop in time, preferably without endangering passengers, some of whom may be standing. For the same reason (and also due to the laws of physics), a train can't instantly accelerate from 0 mph to 30 mph, so each time a train has to slow or stop, the delay gets longer.\n\nSo this sends a sort of ripple down the line, with trains having to stop for progressively longer periods of time.\n\nDriverless trains might cope better with this, since they eliminate the reaction times between the driver seeing a green light and pushing a lever, but you would still have the problem that since trains have to gently slow to a stop and gently accelerate again, so driverless trains won't solve the problem completely."},

{"title":"ELI5:What exactly causes a freshwater to die when it is put in saltwater, or vice versa?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"Fish store manager here!\n\nThe fish die from *osmotic shock*.\n\nYour cell membranes try not to let water through, but some still does. But bigger molecules and the stuff dissolved in the water, like salt, does not get through. When water passes through a *semipermeable membrane* - one that allows some stuff through but not others - it's called osmosis. When there is a higher concentration of dissolved minerals or salts on one side of the membrane, because of some physical properties of how water molecules interact and how liquids work, there is *osmotic pressure* pushing the water through the membrane to equalize the concentration. Simply: if there's more salt inside your cells than outside, water will enter the cells without your cells making it happen, and vice versa.\n\nWith that out of the way: the concentration of salt inside the cells of freshwater fish is higher than the water they're in. This means water is constantly passing into their cells. They spend a lot of energy moving extra water out. If the concentration of salt drops too low, vital cell functions stop working. So when you put them into saltwater, they can't deal with the osmotic pressure. Their cells are used to removing water, not holding it in. They can't process all the salt. So, paradoxically, they dehydrate.\n\nThe opposite is true of saltwater fish. Their cells are constantly flushing out salt and they have several cellular mechanisms to hold onto pure water. Believe it or not, saltwater fish don't drink a lot of water. They get as much as they can from their food, like seaweed that concentrates the fresh water, or other fish that are trying to hold onto it. When you put them into fresh water, their cells are still trying to soak up all the water they can get and flush out salt. But with the concentration of salt now higher inside their cells than out, water is sucked in much faster than their cells can deal with. Those vital cell functions that rely on salts stop working. Sometimes the cells even burst! The water passing the membranes makes them swell up and often the membranes aren't strong enough so the cell bursts and dies. This adds up and slowly kills the fish from osmotic shock \n\nYou can use this to your advantage, though. Smaller things with fewer cells, and invertebrates like many parasites, have trouble regulating the salt content in their cells. So you can put a fish with certain diseases like ich (pronounced \"ick\") in the \"wrong\" water. It'll damage many of the fish's cells, but if it's not for long the fish will deal with it long enough and recover, but the parasites won't!"},

Everyday the slate gets wiped clean and fresh to start learning and seeing something new.\n\nEvery now and then, the brain takes a brief screenshot or a short video clip and stores that away in the memory banks.\n\n Sometimes it's very vivid, so you recall a lot of details. Other times, it's stored like a rough estimate and idea of \"X was here, did Y things, at Z time\", and the brain recreates the memory on the fly.\n\nMemories are kind of stored in neuron circuits.

{"title":"ELI5: If you press your finger against your eyelid on the side that the nose is on, a black dot appears in your vision on the opposite side. Why?","question_detail":"I don't know if I'm seeing things but this happens with both of my eyes and I'm curious to what's going on. Press (gently) against your eyelid on the top and on the side that your nose is on and a black dot appears. ","answer":"Okay. So there are two things that are actually happening here.\n\nThe first thing that happens is directly related to the black dot. To understand this we will need to first look briefly at the anatomy of the eye. \n\n**From Out to In**\nThe white part of the eye that is visible to you is called the sclera, a dense, tough protective coating that has superficial veins running through it.\nDeep to the sclera is a layer of connective tissue that has a lot of blood vessels running through it. This layer is called the choroid.\nDeeper to the choroid, i.e. the innermost layer is the retina. The retina has 10 layers by itself, but the most important is the innermost 2 layers, which are the **Retinal Pigment Epithelium**, that sits just above the choroid, and the **Layer of Rods and Cones**, which are responsible for all of your vision. This layer is **VERY** sensitive to changes in blood flow, oxygen and nutrient supply. Because these cells are all neurons, they depend on both a steady stream of glucose as well as oxygen in order to function efficiently. This becomes important in a few minutes.\n\nKeep in mind that the eye is a pressurized globe, and the fluid that circulates inside; the aqueous and vitreous humor, is what keeps it inflated. This pressure is exerted from **inside to outside**.\n\n A general rule of systemic circulation is that small blood vessels such as arteries, will always make sure that blood is flowing from an area of high pressure to low pressure. At the level of arteries in the eye though, the pressure they exert is very low, to the point where if there is a little extra external pressure, they can be occluded or compressed, reducing the blood flow through that area. Even more susceptible to compression are the veins and capillaries which don't have very thick walls, and can easily be affected by pressure.\n\nNow here's the important point : **Perfusion Pressure**\n\nBasically, perfusion pressure is the minimum force with which blood should move in order to deliver oxygen and blood. It is the difference in amount between the blood pressure in the arteries, and the pressure of the fluid or structures surrounding the arteries. We can illustrate this in the equation here.\n\nPerfusion pressure = Mean Arterial Pressure - Intraocular Pressure.\n\nAn easy way to look at this is to imagine your vessels like a stretchy garden hose. If you step on the hose, you are increasing the external pressure, and everything before the blockage starts to swell and back up. Whatever is coming after the blockage is having lesser flow as well. The net effect ? Decreased flow on both sides. No new nutrients or oxygen.\n\nSo, say you press your finger against your eyeball. The blood vessels are now wedged between the pressurized aqueous and vitreous humor inside the eye, and the finger outside. Same thing happens as with the garden hose, and the blood flow decreases in that area.\n\nRemember those cells we talked about ? The rods and cones ? They're quite sensitive to these changes. The nerves that surround it are also sensitive to these changes. So they stop getting fresh nutrients and start to malfunction.\n\nWhen neurons malfunction, they stop transmitting information, and when that happens, you experience an area of blackness in your field of vision, a temporary **scotoma** so to speak. The reason it's black is because your brain is not getting any information from that area. Keep it pressed too long and the back pressure will travel to the rest of the eye and cause a further decrease in vision.\n\nWhew. Okay. \"But hang on,\" you must be thinking, \"If I press the side close to my nose, why do I see a black dot on the other end ? What gives ??\"\n\nWelcome to the slightly counterintuitive, but interesting world of vision optics.\n\nhttp://www.digicortex.net/node/40  This link illustrates how your visual field works.\n\nWe'll keep it simple to avoid confusion yeah ? \n\nYour eyes see things slightly differently. Take your right eye for example. Whatever you see on the **left** half of your field of vision, is actually light that is falling on to the **right** side of your eye. In the same way what you see on the **right** side of your vision is the light that is falling onto the **left side** of your eye.\n\nNow, the reason the system is structured like this is because your eye acts like a pinhole lens. So whatever light comes from outside ends up getting flipped upside down and left to right. The brain is clever, so it designed the neural input in such a way to detect this and correct everything so you see it right side up.\n\nThis set up of the visual field is the reason why you see the black dot on the opposite end of the eye. \n\n**TL;DR**\n\nThe black spot is a temporary power shortage in the visual neurons caused by blood vessels temporarily occluding due to pressure from the outside and inside working together.\n\nThe reason the black spot appears on the opposite side of where pressure is being applied is because the human visual field is built in an inverted manner to correct for the normal physical flipping of images by the lens in the eye."},

During the Victorian ages it was assumed women had far higher sex drives. \n\nMen and women tend to have fairly equal sex drives but individual biological variation, social pressure (peer pressure, religion, reputation, etc), and age all alter how often people have sex or try to have sex and make it seem like one gender has a higher drive for sex than the other.

{"title":"ELI5: How does muscle tissue repair at a cellular level when it has been damaged?","question_detail":"[deleted]","answer":"Afaik muscle tissue is never recovered. What normally occurs is that the muscular tissue is substituted by fibroblasts, the main cell type of the connective tissue (which basically acts as a glue bonding all other tissues together).\n\nThe inflammation onset after the damage is responsible for attracting fibroblasts to the damaged area, which in turn start to multiply and secrete collagen fibers until the area is covered. Now, while fibroblasts/collagen fibers are somewhat elastic, they do not have the capacity to contract like regular muscle tissue, so the overall contraction capacity of the muscle ends up being impaired. This is why people who had a heart stroke are more susceptible to other heart diseases: after the stroke, the injured heart muscle is replaced by fibroblasts, reducing its overall pumping capability."},

{"title":"ELI5: What role do Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration play in the Carbon Cycle?","answer":"photosynthesis produces carbon compounds, cellulose mostly. The structure of the plant is mostly cellulose which is a polysaccharide that we can't digest. But plants produces fruits that we can digest.

{"title":"ELI5:Why can my phone accurately recognize spoken language in a crowded hallway but Captchas are still used to prove you're human?","answer":"Computers can deal with audio *far* better than they can graphics. \n\nThey can take an audio signal, break it down into component parts (via some implementation of a fourier transform) and the result can be compared to model signals - whichever the input is most similar to, the phone will believe is what you meant to say.

{"title":"ELI5: a turbocharger vs a supercharger on a car, what's the difference?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"A turbo charger uses exhaust power to spool a turbine that then unspools sucking in more outside air and compressing it before pushing it into the intake increasing air pressure and combustion resulting in more power. \n\nBecause of the spool up time a turbo charger has a time window I which it can increase pressure and power, so these are chosen to be when a car may need more power.\n\nA supercharger takes power off of the motor mechanically to power the compressor pushing air into the intake. This cuts some of the power off of the engine but then boosts it via the same compression.  Because the power being taken from the motor is continuous, the compressor runs continuously, giving a constant boost to the engine.\n\nThe third is a blower. This takes power form the engine to colder external air into the intake, but does not perform any actual compression of the incoming air."},

{"title":"[ELI5][ENGINEERING] Why do car engines have the capacity to reach speeds that are outright dangerous and most drivers will never need to reach?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"There's two answers, one of which is boring and the other of which is interesting. We have speed regulators in our cars, and they are set by the manufacturer of the vehicle so that customers don't break their cars. There's a lot of argument about whether they should be set lower (a 2017 Toyta Camry can hit 122 mph before being electronically limited), but generally the personal freedom side has won out. The real answer is an technical one, which is far more interesting. \n\nFrom an engineering standpoint, there's one very big reason. We require a lot of energy to accelerate our cars, much more than it takes to drive at a consistent speed. When we merge onto a highway (for example), our cars are working much harder to raise the speed of the car then they do once we're on the highway. There's fundamental physical laws that engineers use to calculate the specifics, but essentially a car can accelerate faster if it weighs less, has a more powerful engine, and has less front facing area (think a Ferrari vs. a semi).  \n\nWhen we design engines, the goal is to get high enough horsepower and torque (so the customer is satisfied with the driving mechanics of their car) while also minimizing fuel usage (so the EPA is satisfied), which has resulted in around 150-200 horsepower and pound-feet of torque of  for the average new car. A simple way to think of horsepower is that it is what keeps us going, while torque is what gets us going. When the engine in our car spins it generates torque and horsepower based on the speed of the engine, which we can graph as you can see [here](https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a69447cd5dc3409a047fcc11d1eb950c?convert_to_webp=true). We would say this car has a max of 280 horsepower and 240 Newton-Meters (not to be confused with pound-feet, the imperial version) of torque. You would find a similar engine on a new V6 sedan. As a very general rule of thumb, higher torque engines also have higher horsepower. \n\nNow, back to the car itself. As I mentioned above, getting good fuel economy is very important to both the federal government and to buyers, and fuel economy is very dependent on the weight of the car as well as its shape. The end result is that most modern cars are very aerodynamic, meaning that there is less wind force opposing the car as it drives down the road. This combined with very smooth modern highways and very precise modern wheels/tires results in very relatively little force opposing the motion of your car. As we start driving faster, the force of air resistance increases quadratically (ie: double speed, 4x force of air resistance) until eventually our engine cannot generate the horsepower required to overcome the air resistance (plus all the other resistances in our car) and we reach our top speed. At very high speeds, air resistance becomes the majority of the force opposing the car, so aerodynamics become especially important. This is why a Ferarri 458 with 500 hp and lb-ft of torque can break 200 mph while a Ford Raptor with a similar engine output is limited to 100 mph. "},

Each of these shapes changes how fast it burns by fractions of a second and how clean the burn is to prevent fouling of the chamber and barrel. A .45 ACP with a cylinder shaped cartridge and short barrel can use a quick burning powder to achieve max bullet speed.

{"title":"ELI5: Why does tv series seem to have higher scores than movies on IMDB?","question_detail":"It seems to me that a lot of TV series have scores above 8, while even acclaimed movies score around 7. Why does that happen?","answer":"If you see a great movie, you'll go and rate it highly. If you see a shitty movie, you'll go and rate it low. If you see an OK movie, you might not bother to rate it.\n\nNow, with a TV series, you have lots of opportunities to either produce a shitty episode or a great episode. Generally speaking, if you watch a shitty episode, you'll stop watching the series, but you only spent 45 minutes watching it, so you might not bother rating it. If you watch a great episode, then you might go and rate it.\n\nIf you watch an OK episode, you'll probably give the show another chance and watch another episode."},
{"title":"ELI5: what is Anti-Matter, how was it discovered and what proof is there of its existence?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"Antimatter is like ordinary matter, except some properties of it are reversed (hence anti-). The main one you'll come across is electric charge - for example whereas protons have +1 charge, antiprotons have -1 charge, but there are a couple of other quantum numbers in there too which are reversed.\n\nAs for evidence of its existence, there is plenty, and there is enough for it to be generally accepted to have existed. To my knowledge, the earliest discovery of it was in 1932, but its existence had been theoretically predicted by Dirac in 1928 - to put it simply it filled a few major holes in our understanding of particle physics. There have been plenty of other discoveries of it from multiple particle detectors, and they all fit within our theory, so we're pretty sure it exists.\n\nAs for different states of matter - hypothetically you could have all the same states of antimatter as you do for matter. The difficulty in getting them is that antimatter doesn't stick around for very long. As soon as it comes into contact with matter, it annihilates, releasing energy. As there is a fair bit of matter in the world, that tends to happen fairly quickly - at best you only get a handful of particles in existence in one place at a given time, and that's not really enough to make a solid, liquid, or anything else."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why some people are born with straight hair and some people are born with curly hair?","answer":"Genetics decides if your hair follicles will be round (straight hair) or be partially round with a flat side (curly hair). You can test it with a playdo extruder toy. The round hole you push the clay through, will result in straight cylindrical clay. If you extrude the clay through something with a flat side, it will curl. Could also Google how different pastas are made. Spaghetti is straight for this reason. "},
{"title":"ELI5: why isn't virus protection built into windows?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"Modern operating systems like iOS, Android, and Chrome OS don't need virus protection because they were designed from scratch to not allow untrusted code to run with any privileges. It's not *impossible* to write a virus for these operating systems, but it's much, much harder. When viruses do appear, the companies that own the OS (Apple or Google) can just kick out the offending app and patch the vulnerability the virus exploited.\n\nWindows has been around a lot longer. Back when Windows first appeared, nobody had thought about virus protection. The operating system assumed that anything the user downloaded should be allowed to do whatever it wanted.\n\nMicrosoft can't just fix this without breaking all of the existing Windows software. They've tried to push all developers to use newer, safer methods of writing software, but they can't just throw away the old way of doing things or lots of popular Windows applications would just stop working.\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: In the U.S. federal budget, what makes mandatory spending mandatory? How is this enforced?","question_detail":"I'm not American myself, and I'd like to understand this. I've seen some great explanations of how the U.S. federal budget works, how it's decided, what the categories are, etc. But this piece is still a mystery to me. What would happen if the U.S. government failed to spend this money? Or is that even possible?\n\n(Edit: Not totally sure what the best flair for this question is. Economics? Culture? Other?)","answer":"\"Mandatory\" spending means that Congress has enacted a permanent law deciding how much should be spent on something. For example, people that become eligible for Social Security must be paid according to the formula for eligibility; Congress doesn't intend to change the amount from the year to year (although it could). This is a specific example of \"entitlement\" spending--citizens are entitled to that money. They can even sue the government if they're not paid what they're due. Congress would have to change the law to reduce Social Security benefits.\n\nThis means that a big block of the budget isn't flexible. The money that the government is free to spend is the \"discretionary\" portion of the budget."},

Your brain sends these signals to test if you're ready. After a while your body is bound to enter a state of deep physical relaxation. Once your body is relaxed you just have to relax your mind. Do a transcendental meditation, silence your inner voice and just stare into the 3d black void. If you can't silence your inner voice then focus only on your breathing. Same as meditation really. If you do that for long enough you 100% fall asleep or start hallucinating directly into a dream because it's such little brain stimulation. This is what I do anyway to fall asleep in under 5 mins almost 99% of the time."},

{"title":"ELI5:What makes an astronaut's job so hard?","answer":"Spaceflight is really expensive, quite rare, and lots of people want to be astronauts. That means that space agencies have the option to hire only the very best, so far as they can judge. They have the time to train astronauts in a huge range of situations; being an astronaut is basically loads and loads of training and not much spaceflight. And they can justify the effort and expense because the last thing they want is an astronaut messing up the mission and killing everyone.\n\nIt's true that spacecraft are complicated, flight can be physically demanding, and space is an inherently hazardous environment, but plenty of other jobs are that way too. What's distinctive for astronauts is the level of responsibility. It's not unique in *that* either. Medicine carries similar responsibility, but then note that while doctors are much more common than astronauts they have to study and train just as long before being allowed to do."},

It won't protect you from law enforcement if they want to track you, since all your traffic routes through the same VPN server and they can unmask you by looking at traffic into the VPN, but it will block third party websites and private actors from identifying you easily.\n\nTOR is a more extreme approach and works better at protecting privacy than VPN, but it greatly diminishes the utility of the internet.  TOR works by routing your web surfing through a large number of different routers all over the world, sort of like VPN but having many go betweens, that are constantly shifting.  This makes it really hard to figure out where your traffic is coming, including for law enforcement.  The consequence of this, however, is very slow web surfing and a lot of web functionality simply won't work.  You have to use a special browser for this."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why does coffee make me high strung and twitchy but tea doesn't?","answer":"Coffee is brewed with beans that have been roasted. When the beans are roasted the caffeine in them is broken down from complex polyphenol molecules into simple caffeine molecules which are easier for your body to digest. This means the caffeine hits you very quickly, and in turn provides a short lasting burst of stimulation. \nTea, on the other hand, is brewed with leaves that have simply been dried, not roasted. The caffeine is is still bound up in complex molecules that your body metabolizes at a slower rate, providing a longer lasting, but less intense stimulation. \nGreen tea also contains an amino acid called L-Theanine, which has a calming effect. It works well with caffeine to take the edge off the stimulation, hence no jitters. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine"},

I can however answer a few of your questions.\n\nThe dot derivative is a derivative with respect to time. so r(dot) is velocity.

{"title":"ELI5: How are 1500 calories in a cupcake different from 1500 calories in vegetables or meat?","question_detail":"Why do they vary in how much they fill you up if they contain the same number of calories?","answer":"A calorie is just a unit of energy. The calories stated on food packaging are what's called \"metabolic calories\", aka calories the body can make use of. Like touched upon by another poster, the energy you get from burning a chunk of wood can be measured in calories, but if someone put wood chips in your food, your body wouldn't be able to absorb this energy.\n\nYour body needs time to process food, and because your stomach and intestines are limited in volume, you can't fit any amount of food in there. If you eat a less energy-dense food, your body will tell you you're full while that food is being digested, even if it maybe only had a handful calories in it. \n\nIf you had hypothetical sugar cube that contained 2000 calories, that wouldn't fill up enough space inside you for your body to even notice it was there, and it wouldn't tell you you're full.\n\nThe body doesn't determine if you're full or not based on how many calories you've eaten. It's not capable of determining the exact energy density of the food you eat the second it's in your stomach, and how fast it's able to process it to make room for more. That's why eating foods that are slower to digest and less energy dense make it easier to not over-eat."},

I'll do my best to answer your questions.\n\n&gt;I understand that milk would be made up of organic molecules and so are most drinks...but water is inorganic, right?\n\nWater is inorganic. Something is organic if it has carbon. Water has only hydrogen and oxygen. No carbon.\n\n&gt;How does the body differentiate/does the body differentiate between these different compositions?\n\nWater is absorbed and processed as is, and most water lost is through sweat, breath, or urine. Most other substances are broken down or digested, but certain artificial substances such as Splenda are inorganic as well as indigestible, because the body cannot break them down to generate energy."},

Since heat is a form of energy, heating an object will theoretically increase its mass very, *very*, **very**, slightly.  In practical situations, heating an object will probably cause tiny parts of it to evaporate away and this will be a much bigger effect.

It subscribes to the labor theory of value and seeks to abolish wage labor for not compensating the worker fairly for their labor based on this theory of value.  Communism (either definition) is a type of socialism, but it is not the sole type.  (Note:  socialism does not necessarily have state ownership of industry, an expansive welfare state, or abolition of markets, nor does it necessarily exclude these things)\n\nCapitalism:  a system wherein private property owners (bosses, shareholders, corporations with legal personhood, etc.) and private property are recognized by the state.

{"title":"ELI5: What's happening when I'm overthinking about something?","answer":"\nSo, your question is a little bit broad, but the easiest way to explain it is, overthinking something is usually brought on by a stressful or potentially stressful situation. \n\nWith that being said, you can overthink any topic if you tried, and here is why. \n\nThough \"overthinking\" is a slang term, we don't use that word in the medical field, well we do when we say it to each other, but it is not a diagnosis or anything. When facing the stressful situation or whatever the case may be, there are probably multiple aspects to the situation. Albeit emotional or decision-based.  \n\nWhen the brain begins to focus on possible outcomes versus obvious or controllable outcomes this triggers the chemical response that causes stress, which leads to more thinking of all the variables in the situation. So you have this trifecta of things going on. \n\n1. Situation\n2. Variables / Emotional response vs. Behavioural\n3. Introduction of stress, leading to an overwhelming feeling. \n\nSo when this happens, and everyone does it, so its not something that you need not worry about. To stop it, turn your attention to something else and take a refresher, tv show, youtube browsing, just something distracting. Then re-visit the situation and even make a pros and cons list if that helps. Now of course sometimes these things pop up last minute with little time to respond, but again take a breather, then approach it again. \n\nQualifier: I am a Medical Doctor. \nDisclaimer: All information provided in posted comments are answers to posted questions.

{"title":"ELI5: Freckles","answer":"When humans migrated to Europe their dark skin was not well suited for the climate and the low level of sun.

So far, unfortunately, there is no way to determine the EXACT time at which the pressure builds and erupts. \n\nBut we do know of places where earthquakes occur regularly.

{"title":"ELI5: Why did some cultures develop written language and others didn't?","question_detail":"The first written language came from Mesopotamia thousands of years ago, but other societies in the New World and sub-Saharan Africa never did. Why is that?","answer":"Written language has always followed agriculture, since agriculture freed up so much time. Early agriculture started around places dependent on relatively regular flooding, places like Egypt and Mesopotamia had brief times of harvest in tune with the cycles of the Nile and the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. Once cities were developed and grain was able to be stored, people had a lot more time to focus on... really whatever the hell else they felt like. At a certain point, elites in government or religious organizations wanted to be able to keep records. Interestingly enough some cultures developed numeric systems faster than written systems, we've found prehistoric records of tallys and the Inca system of Quipu was primarily for counting.\n\nThe population of the New World arrived a lot later on the scene and because of their nomadic lifestyles, didn't adopt the same kind of storage systems that freed up time in the Old World. Obviously there are cool exceptions, like the Maya, but most of the western hemisphere was populated with hunter gatherers and slash and burn agriculture that didn't lead to setting down and developing cities.\n\nWhen the land is abundant and plentiful, it's pretty easy to keep moving to follow game and find new fertile land, but as resources dwindle people tend to join together and stay put. Mesopotamia had people for a loooooong time before written language showed up, and had definitely been slowly chipping away at the natural resources available, so agriculture on a large scale and bringing people together would have helped with the resource crunch and allowed for writing. The New World had less people for a shorter amount of time, so most cultures didn't experience shortages that would have prompted them to band together.\n\nOnce people without written language came into contact with cultures with writing, it's a lot easier to co-opt what was already done. Written language in the New World probably would have happened without contact to the Old World once they started to experience the resource crunches that led to agriculture and if they had the same kind of time as the Old World.\n\nSource: A history class about human interactions with nature; Wikipedia.\n\nMotivation: Avoiding a paper on the New World.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_first_written_accounts\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_numeral_systems\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistoric_numerals\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quipu\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5 the relationship between GABA and anxiety/mental disorders","answer":"GABA is a lil molecule called a neurotransmitter. Your brain cells communicate with one another by converting electrical activity to the release of the lil molecules called neurotransmitters. The lil GABA molecules are then received by the next brain cell. Think of mailing a letter: first you have a message to send, then you take it to the post office where some witchcraft happens and it ends up on a mail truck to be delivered to your friend. GABA is like the letter you send (a message) and the people who send and receive those messages are like the brain cells (aka neurons).\n\nSo you're sending your letter along the mail pathways, but some letters are really exciting (YOU JUST WON A TRIP TO DISNEY WORLD) and some are depressing (your grandmother died). if you get some exciting news, you're gonna dance around and go celebrate, send letters to all of your friends, etc. but if you get some bad news, you'll probably want to stay inside, be alone for a bit and not send any letters. in anxiety, we see that lots of messages are being sent, but those messages are more like \"oh god, what if something terrible happens\" so they're not exactly a trip to Disney world.\n\nGABA is what's called an \"inhibitory neurotransmitter\" so it's like getting a depressing letter. and it reduces electrical activity (message sending) in the brain. \n\nsomebody thought \"hey if anxiety is just is just a lot of activity (letter sending) of anxious thoughts, why don't we just add GABA to slow down the messages?\" but it's not that simple, and the mechanisms of anxiety and other mental disorders can't be attributed to a single cause. there are many factors that play a role in the expression of mental illness. \n\nnote: all of this is incredibly oversimplified. Too much GABA does not directly induce depression, nor does it directly reduce anxiety. the brain is super complex and if it was all this simple, we'd have cured all these mental disorders by now. but it's not this simple, and there are numerous other factors that come into play.\n\nTL;DR: GABA inhibits electrical activity in the brain, so it makes logical sense to add GABA to call down the anxiety-like overdrive of message sending. but it's not that simple, and we don't actually know how it works"},

{"title":"ELI5: How does a police officer's radar gun precisely gauge the speed of vehicles moving left to right/right to left/toward him/away from him/etc even when his own vehicle is moving?","answer":"Moving radar systems are real, and common. Ignore other posters who say radar is only stationary.\n\nMobile radar works just the same as stationary radar, with a bit of math added in.   Stationary radar sends out a wide beam of radio waves at a specific frequency. A moving object will modify that frequency when it bounces the signal back. The radar gun can calculate based on the change in frequency the speed of the object. Since the beam is wide, though, a lot of it goes around the object and will hit stationary objects. The radar sees that signal returned, but it knows that those objects aren't moving, and it ignores it.\n\nMobile radar does the same thing; sending out a wide beam. The returned signal this time comes back as the total difference between the moving police car and the other vehicle. So far, all you know is that the two cars are approaching each other at a total of 130mph. The radar then takes all that extra signal that is going out, around, and past the other car, and hitting stationary objects to calculate the speed of the police car (say, 60mph). It then subtracts the police car speed from the approaching speed, (130-60) and you're left with the approaching vehicle's speed!\n\nAs far as left right movement goes, the radar can only determine how fast the car is getting closer to it. If the vehicle is also travelling at a bit of an angle to the radar, the calculated speed will actually be a bit lower than the full speed of that car, actually making the radar think you are going slower than you really are."},

Oil at the boiling point usually explodes into flame, but at lower temperatures (around  300 to 375 degrees) doesn't burn and is hot enough to brown things.  \nWater in the food boils and the resulting steam keeps the oil from soaking into the food, so while water at 350 degrees under enough pressure not to boil would cook things, the result would be less appetizing."},

{"title":"ELI5: What is credit, and why is it THAT important?","question_detail":"Im from Europe, and often while watching movies or series (or even surfing reddit), someone mentions credit. Either having bad credit, or worrying about it. I dont understand what it is. Is it just money on your credit card? why do you need it to buy a house or a new phone?","answer":"In America, most of us have been conditioned to accept the fact that loans are good, that debt is normal.  We buy cars we can't afford and pay on them for 6 gears or so. We buy houses we can't afford to pay off in 15 years or so and we end up getting 30 year loans.  We think  that we have to have a good credit score. \n\nIt costs money to have a good credit score. You can do the reach and it costs tens of thousands of dollars in interest and lost opportunities  to get and maintain a high credit score via way of carrying debt and paying interest.\n\nYou don't want a bad credit score and having a zero credit score is better than a bad one.  You don't need a credit score to buy things. You shouldn't be buying things of you can't pay cash for them anyway so if you are paying cash you don't need a credit score at all.  If you want to buy a house you can do so without a credit score with a manual underwriting of the loan.\n\nHaving said that, I have debt,  I have a credit score in the upper 700's. I have a house I owe a mortgage on.  My car is paid off and my debt is getting paid off."},
{"title":"When driving for long periods of time and then you stop, the terrain seems to be coming towards you still.

You've probably seen something that says \"stare at this for 30 seconds and look away\" and you see moving lights or different colors on an image - this is almost exactly the same. Our brains protect from overstimulation by getting used to our environment and blocking out stimuli that are constant, like not noticing the noise of the fan in your office anymore because it's been on so long. It gives the brain more time to focus on the things in the environment that are changing. When you've been driving for a while, especially on straight highways, you get used the the ground coming at you fast as an evolutionary advantage, and it takes time for you to adjust to holding still again because that stimulus didn't change for so long.

{"title":"ELI5:Why is it that sound travels faster at night than during the day time?","question_detail":"I haven't looked into it, but I was told this once and always in the back of my head wondered why. I understand how sound travels, but can't really wrap my head around the idea that it can travel faster at night.","answer":"Its not that sound travels *faster* at night, it's that it can be heard along the same plane from a further distance.\n\nThis is due to [sound refraction.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction_(sound)) \nEssentially, think about sound waves as always moving towards the cool air. During the day, you've got warm air below and cool air up in the atmosphere. Sound will curve upwards towards the cool air, causing the sound waves to only travel a relatively short distance before passing over your head.\n\nHowever, at night, you've got cool air near the surface and the warmer air is rising. So you have an inverse refraction where once the sound waves reach a certain apex, they defend back towards the surface again. \n\n[Here's a visual aid.](https://www.thermaxxjackets.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/sound-waves1.png) "},

{"title":"ELI5: Why does the Moon takes the same time to rotate around itself than it does to go around the Earth?","question_detail":"I do know this fact makes that the same side of the Moon is always dark and the other one is always light, and I can easily see in a geometric way why does this work. What I do not know is why both periods are equal. Thanks","answer":"When the periods don't line up you have tides.  The familiar ones on earth are due to the fact that our day is shorter than our month.  Due to friction, the tides lag behind the moon; high tide happens (on average, very roughly) after the moon is overhead, and the gravity due to those tides pulls on the moon and affects its its orbit.  The equal and opposite reaction means that the moon pulls on the earth and affects its rotation.  Both the day and the month are getting very slowly longer and eventually they would become equal (in billions of years from now, if the sun doesn't expand and destroy the earth first, which it probably will).\n\nThe moon is much smaller than the earth so its rotation is more affected by tides, and tides due to the earth are also bigger than those due to the moon.  So the moon already went through the slowing process and the length of the day on the moon long ago became the same as that of the month.  Tidal forces ensure it stays exactly in sync as the length of the month slowly increases as discussed above."},

When children see lack of security or affection, they rush into irresponsible sexual or violent behavior, that damages them emotionally and mentally.\n\nEssentially, being a brat or troublesome depends on the nurturing and environment that is provided to the child, there is a higher probability of the same being of poor quality in single parent childhoods.\n\nBut, can you do without negative impact on the mental framework on the  mind of children completely?\n\nNo.\n\nAnd you shouldn't. The world is a harsh place. Being brattish is just a cry for attention and love for children.\n\nWhen bought up right, in a fulfilling environment, with a single parent or both or multiple set of parents, the child will develop into a sensible, responsible kid with no inclination towards activities that spell trouble.

{"title":"ELI5: Asynchronous Motor","question_detail":"So, I'm not an engineer and I have only the most basic knowledge of physics, but what is an asynchronous motor and how does it work?","answer":"I'll try to cover it as best as I can, hopefully it's not too long. First some basics, if you have a coil of wire and run an electric current through it it makes a magnetic field. If you change the direction of the current the poles on the magnetic field. This is how an electromagnet is made. AC current is current that is constantly switching direction, if you connect a coil to an AC outlet it will make an electromagnet that rapidly switches poles. This also works the opposite direction. If you move a magnetic field through a coil of wire it makes a current. If you change the direction or polarity of the magnetic field moving through it you change the direction of the current through the coil.\n\nWhen you push a magnetic field through a coil of wire and a current flows, the current produces it's own magnetic field that opposes the magnetic field that created it. This pushes back. Similarly, when a current flows through a coil and makes a magnetic field move, the force the field pushes back with reduces the current (creates an apparent resistance in the coil). These effects are how force is converted two and from mechanical and electrical forms in a motor.\n\nSo a very simply generator can be made by taking a [coil of wire, and spinning a magnet next to it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKXkO6E3oMA). The coil of wire will make power. You can try this at home and will likely get it to work if you have something that's very low power to test it with. A typical synchronous AC motor will have a couple of coils of wire (the stators) wires in such a way that they will create north and south poles that rotate around the motor. Typically these will run off three phase power which means you can wire up six coils to it and get six different magnetic fields in varying intensity. In the right order it will make a relatively smooth rotating magnetic field. The drive shaft will be connected to a rotor that has magnets on it, and when placed in the magnetic field will rotate at a rate dependent on the frequency and stator count of the motor (specifically, each magnetic pole would pass 6 coils of wire per cycle of AC power in the design above). These motors always spin at the same speed with a fixed frequency power source (like a wall outlet), if something is harder to turn they just use more power to keep spinning at the same speed.\n\nNow an asynchronous motor, to put it simply, the magnets from the rotor is just completely removed and replaced with more coils of wires, just like the stators, except instead of being wired to a power source, they are wired to each other. Now when a magnetic field moves through the coil it produces a current, and that current is used to power other coils next to it. Since the magnetic field from the stators must move through the coils in the rotor, the rotor must always rotate slower than the magnetic field spins. As something gets harder to spin, the rotor will spin slower which makes the magnetic field move through it faster, and that results in more current and more torque from the motor. The main advantage of these is the \"coils\" can be single turn high current coils, so only a large cage is needed for the rotor, and it actually needs no magnets at all. They are starting to become very popular in electric cars because the very strong magnets needed to make a traditional synchronous motor efficient are very expensive, but similar efficiencies can be had with an asynchronous motor and not require any magnets at all."},

","answer":"Cholesterol is built at the most basic level from acetyl-CoA (CH3CO-CoA), which can result from glycolysis, lipolysis and catabolism of certain amino acids. The acetyl group attached to the CoA is a two-carbon chunk that is built into the cholesterol molecule, while the CoA is a protein carrier that is recycled in the process. The biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol is both long and easily found via Google, but I can go into more detail about individual steps if you are curious. Essentially, enzymes catalyze different reactions that build acetyl groups into a long, branched chain, and then form rings between the branches, and then further alter the molecule by removing carbons and moving around bonds."},

{"title":"ELI5: What are Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems?","question_detail":"","answer":"It was thought around the turn of the 20th Century that all mathematical statements could be proven true or false. In other words, if you can state something using formal mathematics—such as, \"the longest side of a triangle is always shorter than the sum of the other two sides\"—then it can be shown to be correct or incorrect.\n\nThen Gödel came along. He showed that for any \"complicated\" formal system, it's possible to make statements that cannot be shown to be true or false without extending the system. But then all you've done is create a new system for which new statements can be made using the new extensions that also cannot be proven one way or the other.\n\nThe only question left is, \"How complicated is complicated?\" It turns not: Not very. Only very, very simplistic formal systems are exempt from incompleteness."},

Rather they have less dynamic range.  The loudest parts are just as loud as the explosions in the action movie you were watching.  But the softest sounds are *also* just as loud as the explosions in the action movie you were watching.\n\nIn the movie, dialog is quiet.

{"title":"ELI5: How do gasoline grades differ and how does it affect my vehicle?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"Unless you have a car that requires premium gas it has no effect - if you do have a car that requires premium then it makes a difference in that regular gas would either damage your engine or (thanks to modern electronic aids) force it to run in a reduce mode to protect itself from damage.\n\nA gas engines works by squirting a little drop of gas into a chamber that is closed with a piston on one end. At the correct time a spark plug in the chamber fires igniting the gas and causing the air to expand from heat (an explosion). That pushes the piston out which is connected to a shaft that turns. Your car has several of these pistons attached at different points to the shaft - to work properly they need to be fired in a correctly timed sequence otherwise they will be working against one another instead of together and will damage the engine. In some engine designs the pistons even share the same space to push into, meaning that an incorrect timing could instantly cause a catastrophic collision between pistons.\n\nThe octane rating (grade) determines how hard it is to ignite the gas. The spark plug is powerful enough that this rating should't matter however it does matter with regards to high performance engines. They typically use higher pressures in the combustion chambers (called the compression ratio) to make the engine more powerful. These pressures can cause lower octane gas to ignite just from the heat and pressure, before the spark plug fires. For this reason these cars are marked as requiring premium gas, since regular gas could ignite too early and damage the engine."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why do we get chills when experiencing moving events such as music or movies?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"The Biology answer: the central nervous system is reacting (with chills) to an emotional / aesthetic (art) experience. Goose-bumps/chills shiver through the nervous system.\n\nThe fun/philosophy answer: Immanuel Kant wrote about this sort of response to art, calling it the \"sublime.\" He wrote about the sublime in connection with his defining of the Beautiful (which he meant to talk about separately from the normal lower-case word beauty). The art object can be anything that strikes you as profound.\n\nWhen people experience the sublime, they want to tell others about it. It's normal to want to share this found relationship with the art-object (and normal for other people to not necessarily have the same experience, with the same art-object). \n\nThe trickiest part of Kant's Beautiful to \"explain it like I'm five\" is where he says art in this experience must have \"no concept.\" This means art **feels** as though it exposes how meaning itself is irrelevant. If you perceive that some media has a message and it \"means something\" literally, then you're not experiencing the sublime."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why did the US President get the power to pardon people and why does he still need it?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"It's one of the checks and balances that the President (as leader of the Executive Branch) gets against the other two branches.\n\nSo if the legislative branch passes a law that the President doesn't approve of, he can pardon someone who broke that law.\n\nOr if the judicial branch has punished someone for something that the President doesn't agree with (or more harshly than the President would prefer), or if they're interpreting a law in a way that he doesn't agree with, he can pardon that person.\n\nLike many of the powers of the government, the idea of it is to keep an eye on the other branches and keep them from having absolute power in anything.

{"title":"ELI5: Why can't cars go as fast in reverse as they can when you drive normally?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"There's a fairly limited range of speeds that the engine can turn. To allow for a much wider range of wheel speeds there's a transmission which offers a selection of several gears. Each gear offers a progressively higher ratio of wheel speed to engine speed. \n\nGenerally cars don't have a need to go in reverse very fast, so they only get one gear ratio for reverse.

What is blocking my satellite radio?","answer":"Since we seem to be a bit short on actual answers here, I can make some suggestions.  Aside from the obvious (trees, mountains, tunnels, etc) another thing people rarely consider is interference from other sources. Transmitters with narrowly shaped beams are not perfect, and will have odd lobes of high power radio signals pointing out in interesting directions. Those signals can easily swamp out a receiver, as it is listening for a relatively small signal from space. Additionally, the transmit antennas on the satellite itself may have dead spots (or at least lower signal areas) that would make it far easier for the signal to get overridden. \n\n\nOr, as others have suggested, you may be in a tunnel. /s"},

{"title":"ELI5: How exactly could a boat be driven ashore by ice?","question_detail":"Edit: Say a boat traveling in the Arctic ocean","answer":"&gt; How exactly could a boat be driven ashore by ice?\n\nIce covers a very large surface area of the ocean and wind can blow it around. If you have several square miles of ice being blown on by the wind that is a very large force and an enormous weight of ice which has been caused to move in a given direction. When a boat encounters that ice it is unlikely it will be able to do anything but be carried away by its force.\n\nEven when that ice encounters land the momentum and wind pressure on the ice behind it can push it up onto the shore. Any boat between the ice and shore will be carried along for the ride, potentially ending up a significant distance inland.\n\n[Here is an example of this sort of thing happening with a relatively thin sheet of ice.](https://youtu.be/ISpsOERzWGo)"},

{"title":"ELI5: why is Hollywood dying and Bollywood thriving?","question_detail":"[deleted]","answer":"Because the USA, as much as it doesn't want to admit, is in decline as a whole. Infrastructure is in decay. Very few of the working and middle class (both the demographic and the milieu where entertainment professionals originate) have time or money to produce the industrial innovation that they did in the era between 1870-1970. This can be seen in the sheer number of immigrants who comprise American entertainment. Some of the signs of a dying empire is the obsession with nostalgia, regression of adults to childlike interests, and disproportionate interest in sex and vices. Hollywood movies fetishise this in their depictions, while the rest of the world, rising from, rather than becoming third world countries, generally look for meaning verses nihilism. \n\nI wouldn't say Hollywood is \"dying\" however.

{"title":"ELI5: In a zero gravity environment, would a 10kg, solid metal sphere be more difficult to throw than, say, a baseball? And would it accelerate less given the same force behind the throw?","question_detail":"For the purposes of this, let’s also assume I’m somehow anchored in place and so none of the force of my throws would in any way push me backward.\n\nI know F=MA, so it seems like the math says yes, but I had a hard time wrapping my head around how two weightless objects could give more resistance in a throw. \n\nIf acceleration is affected, would momentum and inertia be affected in the same way?","answer":"Yes, because the mass is different.\n\nExactly how you said, the two are weightless, that in common speaking means that the two don't feel the acceleration of gravity (because we said we are in a region of space in which there is no gravity at all). And that's the point: the two objects have the same weight if we refer to the acceleration due to gravity (zero in both cases) but they have different masses, so in general the same force applied to the two objects will give rise to different accelerations.\n\nThe problem is related partially to incorrect use of everyday words: weight is a \"measure\" of force, so saying that my weight is 92kg (but I'm very tall.....:D) is incorrect, because that is my mass. My weight is about 900 newtons. And we usually use weightless when there is no gravity, but gravity is only one kind of acceleration! Saying that you are weightless doesn't mean that you are without mass, and when you want to apply a force mass is the correct constant of proportionality between the force and the resulting acceleration."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why do some people get paralysed by fear?","question_detail":"When fear takes over so much that you cannot move or run away from the dangerous situation, what is the cause for that?","answer":"Your muscles have things called ion channels. These are portals that let things in and out of the muscle. To turn your muscle on, the sodium ion channels open and let sodium ions flow in. This caused the muscle to contract. To turn it off, chloride ion channels must open and cause chloride ions to flow in. The chloride ions neuatralize the sodium ions and the muscle relaxes.\n\nHormones released during times of stress can alter the way these ion channels and other aspects of the muscle function and make it difficult or impossible for a person to move. \n\nA striking examplecof this is in a breed of goats called \"fainting goats\". They have a disorder called myotonia congenita where they have defective chloride ion channels. Because they are defective, chloride ions have trouble getting in to the cell and the goats have difficulty turning their muscles off even in normal circumstancez. But when they are scared and move suddenly it gets worse. Their muscles get stuck on and they often fall over."},

One need in particular is that it has to be safe(r) at high speeds, and it has to handle itself well with the load a typical patrol car carries.\n\nAnd in case of law enforcement, it probably has a back seat that is easier to clean off than the stock car because law enforcement often pick up people who...due to intoxication are more prone to throw up in the car.\n\nAnd some extra electronics for communication and the possibility to lock the doors in the back seat separately.\n\nAnd, you know, some extra blue lights.

{"title":"ELI5: How come you can drink so much more beer than anything else?","answer":"Beer typically has the lowest alcohol content of a drink by volume.

{"title":"ELI5: How can one measure the water activity in a food?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"It's really quite technical. You have to put the food into a controlled-humidity environment, and then measure how it interacts with that environment.\n\n&gt;  In the first method, food of known moisture content is allowed to come to equilibrium with a small headspace in a tight enclosure and partial pressure of water activity is measured manometrically, or relative humidity is measured using a hyqrometer. Water activity is equal to equilibrium relative humidity divided by 100: (a w = ERH/100) where ERH is the equilibrium relative humidity (%). Relative humidity sensors of great variety are available for this purpose, including electric hygrometers, dewpoint cells, psychrometers, and others.\n\n&gt; A second basic method for preparing isotherms is the exposure of a small sample of food to various constant humidity atmospheres. After equilibrium is reached, the moisture content is determined gravimetrically or by other methods. A number of saturated salt solutions are available for this purpose. Saturated salt solutions have the advantage of maintaining a constant humidity as long as the amount of salt present is above saturation level. Salt slushes and solutions of glycerol or sulfuric acid are among those commonly used.\n\n[source](https://www.fda.gov/ICECI/Inspections/InspectionGuides/InspectionTechnicalGuides/ucm072916.htm)"},

{"title":"ELI5:Why do natural gas water heaters need venting but a gas stove does not.","question_detail":"","answer":"First off, lets be clear that a typical 40 gallon gas waterheater is 40,000 BTU. When I checked my gas range, it was more than that. So venting is not based on the quantity of gas burned.\n\nSome years ago I taught night classes in HVAC for the local vocational school. In the mail that I received was a report on children raised in houses with gas ranges had more respiratory disease than those with electric ranges. About that time too, there was an effort to reduce nitrogen oxides levels from the combustion. That was done by placing a stainless steel ring in the flame. The consequence was the flame impingement increased the carbon monoxide so the lesser of the two evils won out and the rings went away.\n\nWhen confined space is brought into the discussion, it only has to do with combustion air. That is, whether the air leaking in from outside is adequate for combustion or if not, outdoor air must be brought to the appliance.\n\nI grew up with gas ranges and have one to this day. However, I have a vent hood that vents to the outside over mine. I don't use it all of the time a burner is on, but on days like thanksgiving it does get a workout."},

{"title":"ELIF: How come even though we all are taught to write at the same time and in the same way, people still end up with vastly different handwriting?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"A few things cause differences to occur with handwriting.\n\nFirst, fine motor control (how well we control our bodies for smaller tasks) varies from individual to individual, based on genetic and environmental factors, so we aren't able to completely replicate each other's handwriting without significant practice. \n\nSecond, most people who learn to write do so through general education, and you usually learn to write at a young age; I personally do not remember being told to practice handwriting beyond elementary school. As you develop physically, your writing changes as well, and if you aren't specifically practicing during this time to preserve one writing style, variances will crop up. In addition, once the basics of writing are learned, most people will develop the skill on their own to whatever comes easiest for them, as handwriting often needs to be done fairly quickly.\n\nFinally, personality *can* come into play with this as well, but only in instances where part of that person's personality centers around their handwriting in a specific way. Trying to derive personalities from examples of handwriting is usually BS because correlation does not equal causation - there can be any number of reasons as to why a person's handwriting looks the way it does."},

{"title":"ELI5: How can adding one element to a compound of elements make it dangerous?","question_detail":"I have next to no knowledge of chemistry, so I apologize if this makes no sense. I just learned heard about a compound called formaldehyde and I saw that it's chemical formula is CH₂O and it made me wonder: if formaldehyde is just one carbon added to water, why does it suddenly become a dangerous chemical?","answer":"You have some reasonable replies, but i think for someone who has next to no knowledge of chemistry there is a LOT to cover.\n\nWe first need to define \"dangerous\" to be something that is dangerous to humans and/or organic life. This has to be said because compounds on their own may be reactive and volatile, but they are not inherently dangerous. That little clarification is important. \n\nWhen we think about life (biological processes) we think about what makes these things (systems) work. We know that eating a sugar cube will break down in our mouth in water, then where does the sugar go? It becomes absorbed throughout the intestinal tract, and is transferred to your blood and liver for more processing and to be distributed throughout the body. Most distinctly, the chemical \"sugar\" can only be absorbed by our bodies providing that we have mechanisms (enzymes and cells) to actually process it. These mechanisms identify molecules in our environment pretty dang specifically, and will only bind to ones like that - usually meaning just sugar, if a sugar and a bunch of others are present.\n\nSo, we have a set-up where sugar (C12H22O11) is bound specifically by an enzyme and broken down into little bits. Simplified, we have a enzyme and a ligand (a bound-molecule) who is specific to that enzyme. In addition to this, enzymes (and in fact, everything we interact with in this way) are just chemical compounds too.\n\nSince chemical theory is based on small differences in the periodic table (which defines each element), you have to consider that this \"small\" change from your perception is a HUGE nuclear change in the chemists perspective. All the stuff that made up that compound is COMPLETELY different, due to quantum and classical mechanics; universal properties. This can change its 3-d structure and its behavior when it bumps into other molecules. For instance, adding an extra electron or taking one away makes a compound hungry or starving for an electron... meaning it will react to become stable (due to thermodynamic principals). There is a LOT to understand an individual chemicals behavior, but just know that a little addition isn't actually a little addition; moreso, it is just written in a traditional convention to be that way and simply appears as a small change. \n\nSo, if you have a chemical that looks pretty much exactly like sugar (but say you've added another atom)and it binds to that enzyme, depending on where and what that atom is, the entire enzyme could \"lock-up\" and not do what it needs to do. You have changed how the enzyme (chemical) interacted with the ligand (chemical), due to a change in properties of the ligand. \n\nFor an analogy, imagine if you had a square magnetic peg (with rounded edges) and a square magnetic hole which matches its shape. For some reason, one square peg with perfectly square edges tries to enter the magnetic hole. Since they're magnets, they try to bind together (we call this inter-molecular forces), and because they're roughly the same shape (we call this steric properties), they further their complementary. But you have just shoved a square peg in a round-ish hole... its stuck, and the hole can't fit anything else in it. Its broken. \n\nWhen we scale these small chemical interactions up to the many many many times they occur in biological systems you see that the resulting \"danger\" is in proportion to how critical that enzyme was to you. Moreover, it does not need to be just enzymes, but any chemical/mechanical system in your body. It becomes dangerous because these small changes actually block processes from happening. \n\nTo further my point to something more specific, [Sarin Gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarin) is a colourless, odorless, and extremely volatile chemical nerve agent. It is 26x as toxic as cyanide. It attacks your nervous system and binds to receptors that control breathing and muscle contractions. These receptors are just in a specific shape (like how a enzyme favors its specific ligand), but Sarin actually holds stronger to these receptors than our own nervous system chemicals do. The result is that just a tiny bit blocks critical receptors which prevent important movement (like muscular movement (heart and lungs) and other bad stuff). It is similar in shape to acetylcholine in the 3-d space thats important for the receptor, causing all these issues. Many other dangerous chemicals can act like this too. \n\nThere is also more complected cases such as hydrogen fluoride. You need more than a basic understand to know whats going on, but it reacts so quickly because Fluorine is in period 2 group VIIA of the table; its starving for electrons and will bind much more properly to organic life than those which occur in our body, due to thermodynamics. \n\n\nI hope i didn't confuse you, but it is a big question with a whole bunch of accidental subquestions inside of it. Hope it helps.\n\n "},

{"title":"ELI5: Why do rockets always look like they're curving/arcing after launch? If their goal is space, wouldn't you want to fly straight up?","question_detail":"","answer":"They go straight up at first to leave the atmosphere ASAP, because drag slows them down.  As soon as they're high enough they top over to almost horizontal because, to make orbit, the key is travelling sideways very fast.

{"title":"ELI5: How will the car launched as a test load today survive the extreme conditions in the outer space without disintegrating?","question_detail":"[deleted]","answer":"Conditions in space are quite extreme, but it's on the scale of extreme towards living things (and working electronics, to some extent). You'll have the vacuum, obviously, high levels of radiation, and high variance between periods of heat and cold.\n\nThe car they're launching is pretty much just a lump of metal. It doesn't care about vacuum, or radiation, or cold, and while it'll get hot, it probably won't get hot enough to melt.\n\nThe one thing that will have an effect on it are micrometeoroids. Micrometeoroids are tiny specks of dust traveling at high speed. They're small and rare enough they won't cause any obvious damage for a while (unless it hits a particularly big one), but we've done tests of materials in space for a long time to know that they wear down materials in space pretty dramatically. It's kind of like slowly sandblasting the exterior over a number of years.\n\nThat being said, a car is still pretty solid. A few years down the line the exterior will look a lot less shiny, and someday it'll start to look pretty deteriorated, but that'll be on the order of decades or centuries. "},

{"title":"ELI5: How do photographers/videographers take old, grainy historic footage and make it look HD?","question_detail":"","answer":"HD resolution is low compared to film. HD is 1980x1080 or 2 Mega pixel. 35mm film work in different ways but you can create a good 5400x3600  image from it that is 20 Mpixel so 10 times the resolution. There is also more colour/grayscale information in the images compared to a digital image\n\n\nSo if all other tings are the same a 16 mm film would have 5 Mpixel so it is better then HD\n\nThe other part is color balance. Old film often look washed out because of age/incorrect camera settings so if you scan it and just use the auto black level in any image program the dark part looks black and light part looks white. I have done it my self with my fathers old photos and they look better on the computer with good balance then they did when they where first taken. You can even scan a picture from a frame that have faded and scan  fix color and create a new copy that look like new/significantly better. Professional used more advanced balancing then the auto function in programs like Photoshop.\n\nA nother step is to remove damages and noise in the image that is obvious artifacts. You can do that manually. It is possible to automate in simple ways in video where you can compare what where in that location the previous fram and what was there in the next frame detect are remove damages to the film of different kinds. \n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5: Insulin Resistance","question_detail":"I have a specific question about insulin resistance and sugar/carbs.\n\nBeing overweight can increase insulin resistance. So, is it true that sugar/carbs don't cause insulin resistance in of themselves, but excess sugar/carbs can cause people to gain weight and that weight gain (not the sugar/carbs) cause insulin resistance?\n\nBasically, I'm leaving a keto diet, but I want to be super careful not to regain weight. I want to add whole grains/beans (after learning what a real serving of carbs is!) because I'll be able to save some money on food.\n\nThank you\n","answer":"Yes insulin resistance is a side effect of obesity.  Basically there are 4 places glucose can go in your body: muscle, liver, fat and blood.\n\nMuscle will be insulin resistant first, then liver, finally fat.

{"title":"ELI5: How do midterm elections affect the outcome of the Presidential elections?","question_detail":"","answer":"They don't... various media sources seem to want to find a correlation of some sort, but it wouldn't actually mean anything. The midterm elections and Presidential elections are separate events, one does not directly affect the other.\n\nFactors relevant in the differences between midterm and Presidential elections:\n\n* Some sources say that certain demographics are less likely to vote in the midterm elections. That is, of course, not a problem.\n\n* One thing everyone forgets when analyzing Senator elections is that different Senate seats are up for election each time. The Senate is divided into three groups (referred to as \"Classes\"), and because the elections are every 2 years but a Senator's term is 6 years, only one of those three groups of Senators is up for election each time."},
{"title":"ELI5: I don’t understand why meddling in elections via social media is so illegal. Would it be illegal for an American company to do it?","question_detail":"[deleted]","answer":"Well, the people who were \"meddling in the elections via social media\" actually committed identity theft and illegally opened accounts under those stolen identities - that's a very serious crime no matter who perpetrates it.\n\nThere's also the fact that Russian-backed hackers attempted to gain access to (or in some cases even did gain access to) almost half the states' electronic voting systems... Which goes far beyond just paying for some advertisements online.\n\nFinally, there's the subversive nature of the deception, which is still continuing to this day. The Russian government does not come out and say \"We are paying for this advertising that talks bad about Clinton\". They use fake companies and fake entities to push this highly divisive and manipulative content out there. Of course people would be far less responsive to it if they knew a foreign government were behind the information, but they don't know that - for all they know, it is their fellow Americans and American-based companies.\n\nSome of those actions themselves may not be illegal based on currently existing legislation, but they do comprise a pillar of Information Warfare known as \"psychological operations\", and as such they do comprise a credible threat that should be responded to appropriately and not ignored."},

{"title":"ELI5: How to shave with an electric shaver?","question_detail":"[deleted]","answer":"Different shaver styles come with different techniques recommended.  However, I can give you a few tips:\n\n1: shave while your face is fully dry.  \n\n2: Some people say to shave while your face is still slightly puffy in the morning, some people say to wait until 20+ minutes after you get out of bed so that your face \"deflates\" a bit.  Try both and see which works better.\n\n3: shave against the direction your hair naturally lies.\n\n4: I find running a finger slightly ahead of the foil helps the stubble stand up so the shaver can cut it without irritating the skin\n\n5: don't use shaving cream with an electric shaver.  Aftershave is a perfume to be used *after* shaving, not before.  It doesn't make a difference to your shave, just how your face smells.  With a straight razor, it can help tighten up the pores to plug up small nicks; you don't get those with an electric shaver.\n\n6: It takes your skin around 2 weeks to adapt to a new electric shaver.  During this time, you may experience some chafing or stubble that just won't cut.  Stick with it, and eventually it'll start working.\n\n7: Not all electric shavers are created equal.  Some really suck at shaving under/over your lip, or shaving below your ears/your neck/adam's apple.  A shaver with a pivoting head helps for some areas; the ability to lock it will help for other areas.\n\n8: Most good shavers have a money back guarantee.  So if you try a style for two weeks and it doesn't \"cut it\" for your shape of head, take it back, get a refund, and try something else.  Some people swear by Braun, some by Philishave; they use two completely different head styles that work for different face shapes / skin types."},

{"title":"ELI5: How are files from games/software able to be torrented?","question_detail":"How exactly does one obtain the files from software to be torrented? ","answer":"Can you clarify the question?\n\nIf you're talking about how a game is pirated, someone bought a copy, and put the files from the disk into a torrent. How people modify a game so it can be played after a torrent download is a bit complex, but they're basically trying to discover the part of the program that validates the key, and removes that functionality. The key is also often tied to encrypting key data, they'll pull that out of memory and bundle it with the rest. Again, they'll need to modify the program to use this version.\n\nIf you're talking about how bit torrent works, it's an algorithm called a \"fountain code\". It's a really clever means of selecting and combining a random selection of bytes from the source data and sending them to all the peers. As soon as any peer gets any number of bytes, they can participate, sending those bytes to all other peers. What makes this great is that downloading a file from one person tends to be inefficient because of the connection between you two and the load on the source, but you can download from multiple sources this way and max out your download speed."},

{"title":"ELI5:Why do chemical reactions produce energy?","question_detail":"I understand energy as the potential for something to move by a force. So heat is molecules move and so on.\n\nbut I don't quite understand why chemical reactions produce energy specifically. I find the same explanation being \"bonds break\" but what about the bonds breaking causes energy(or I should say work) to be produce is it the electron movement or something like in radiation? The closest answer I've found so far on the subreddit is that it has something to o with the electromagnetic force but does that mean when bonds break the atoms \"scurry\" away from each other?","answer":"Heres my take on things:\n\nIn a molecule, the atoms are bound together by covalent bonds, where each atom \"wants\" to share an electron to fill its outermost shell. It will take alot of energy to force the atoms apart and react with other atoms to form different compounds. This \"bond breaking\" is an endothermic change.\n\nSimilarly, when two unstable molecules react to form a more stable one, the energy that kept the molecules apart is no longer needed, so it is released, so this \"bond making\" is an exothermic change.\n\nThis is just the way I picture chemical bonds from the way I learned about them, so I could be wrong."},

The money is used to pay off creditors.\n\nThe actual stock is around pretty much forever, companies in bankruptcy, even in chapter 7 are still around for years as various litigation issues are settled.

{"title":"ELI5 If you were trapped somewhere with no food source but you knew help was on its way, could you slowly eat yourself to survive?","answer":"Self cannibalism of body parts doesn't work.

{"title":"ELI5: Why do people hate the Nazis so much?","question_detail":"[removed]","answer":"The Nazis did a lot of things that are considered bad by society- most notably, human testing, and genocide.  Because this occurred during world war 2, quite possible the most well known and studied war in history, and is heavily tied to the war activities of Germany, pretty much everyone is aware of what the Nazis did.  It also helps that when this was discovered by the allied forces as they liberated the concentration camps where these activities took place, the entire world was made aware of their activities.  Other groups who have done similar things are generally not as well known due to it not being as widely exposed, not being as recent, or even thanks to efforts of the governments responsible to cover them up."},

Is this fusing the light? How did me only flicking it half way cause it? ","answer":"\"Fuse the light\" is likely a regional saying. Rapidly cycling the light switch won't hurt the fuses or the fuse box, but it **will** hurt the light bulb, causing it to burn out very quickly.\n\nLight bulbs emit light because a filament is heated to the point that it glows. Heating also causes expansion and cooling causes contraction, so when you flip the lights on and off and on and off again, you're causing the filament to expand, contract, expand, contract with the heat cycles. Just like bending a paperclip back and forth eventually breaks it, a light bulb can only take so many cycles before it snaps."},

{"title":"ELI5: The origin and power of Credit Bureaus","question_detail":"I just don't get it; it is not a government organization, but EVERYONE gets a credit score when they are 18. There are more people with credit scores than people with driver licenses. If you owe a debt to the state, they seek assistance from credit agencies. The fact that a private entity like that is so integrated with multiple structures within society makes it as suspicious as the Federal Reserve.","answer":"Suppose you are loaning money to people in olden times. If you know the person you can probably make a good guess about how likely you are to be repaid and how much money you are willing to risk. But if you don't know them you will want to ask around to see what other people think, how much money they make, etc. For example of you are a bank you might call another bank to find out if they have done business with the person before, and how it turned out. Anything you found out you would file away for future reference.\n\nAs time went by this became a more difficult task. There are a lot of people to ask and things to check up on. Also there is a potential conflict of interest: If you are asking about the worthiness of a specific person to borrow money then the other bank can infer they are looking for a loan, and potentially take your business away! Since they benefit by being better at assessing risk it isn't in their best interests to share information freely.\n\nInstead it makes sense to farm out this task to an independent organization. These groups gather information about people who borrow money and provide ratings of their ability to be given credit, selling access to lenders who are interested in the results. Called \"Credit Bureaus\" they exist to give a recommendation on your expected future behavior based on a variety of factors including past performance. In essence they are a professional gossip tree about your borrowing habits.\n\nSomeone who is considering lending you money will reasonably wonder about if you will pay them back, even the government, and credit bureaus are the people to ask."},

RQM vs Copenhagen vs Bohm's interpretation vs ... are all diverse interpretations of QM looking for some experiment that would favor one over the others.

{"title":"ELI5: what causes rewinding a VHS to create visual distortions on the screen instead of playing normally in reverse?","question_detail":"","answer":"During normal play, the heads are rotating rapidly, scanning a path diagonally across the tape.  At the same time, the tape is moving slowly forward.  The heads record one frame^(\\*) with each diagonal stripe across the tape.  The exact position and angle of the stripe is affected both by the spinning head and by the tape speed.\n\nIf the playback tape speed is different from the recording tape speed, then the angle of the stripe made by the heads won't line up.  Some of the playback will be from one frame of video and some from one or more following frames.  In between there will be static that comes from the narrow gap between the recorded stripes.\n\nThe basic issue is that the heads are forced to always spin at a speed that matches your video standard, e.g., 30&amp;#8239;Hz (1800&amp;#8239;RPM).  If the tape speed changes to do fast forward, pause, or rewind, then the frame rate on the tape no longer matches the frame rate of the spinning heads and you see stripes of multiple frames with thin, horizontal stripes of inter-frame static in between.\n\n\\* We'll ignore the frame/field interlacing issue here for simplicity."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why do vehicles need gasoline instead of any other liquid to work?","question_detail":"","answer":"In the past, steam engines used pistons, but these were superceded in most cases by steam turbines which are more powerful and more reliable.\n\nWhat most people refer to as \"gasoline engines\" refer to what are technically known as \"Otto Cycle\" engines which use a spark ignition.\n\nThese can, in principle, use many different types of fuel, but gasoline and propane are the most common. These fuels have convenient physical and combustion properties, and are also easily stored and transported.\n\nNatural gas (mostly methane), hydrogen, ethanol, methanol (wood alcohol) and even *synthesis gases* derived from wood or coal can also be used in Otto cycle engines. Nitromethane is also used in drag racing. \n\nEthanol is a common gasoline additive. In some countries like Brazil, fuels composed of 80-90 ethanol are used.\n\nEthanol has superior combustion properties over gasoline, but has a lower energy density, so fuel mileage is not as good.\n\nMany kinds of hydrocarbon fuels can be used.\n\nThe main requirement is that the fuel be either a gas, or easily evaporated in air, to form a proportional fuel-air mixture. The fuel also needs a high auto-ignition temperature. Otherwise, the heat of the compression cycle will cause it to explode prematurely which can cause mechanical damage to the crankshaft parts or the cylinder."},

Sheep are also popular as figurines and gifts from product company Precious Moments and featured on various gift cards such as ones from Hallmark.\n\nBut where did it originate? At first I thought this was a recent thing starting sometime in the 1980's or 1990's but as I searched up more sheep related products and other stuff. It appears that this might had started sometime in the 1930's or 1940's as seen in old greeting cards. Along with Sheri Lewis introduction of the Lamb Chop character in the late 1950's.\n\nI'm going to guess that it could be because sheep are associated with sleep due to the term \"Counting Sheep\", or because the friendly and innocent appearance of a lamb.\n\n\n\n\n\n","answer":"The symbolic connection between the lamb and children goes as far back as the writing of the Christian Bible. The followers of God (the shepherd) are likened to sheep and their children to lambs: \n\n&gt; The Lord Jehovih cometh in strength, and His arm shall rule for Him; He shall feed His flock like a shepherd, He shall gather the lambs in His arm, and carry them in His bosom, and shall gently lead those that give suck (Isa. 40:10, 11)\n\nThey are similarly connected to innocence:\n\n&gt;The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them (Isa 11:6)\n\nAnd Jesus:\n\n&gt; The next day John the Baptist seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world (John 1:29, 36).\n\nVarious nursery rhymes and stories reinforced this tradition through the centuries (e.g. Mary Had A Little Lamb).\n\n"},

Recessive simply means that its less likely to be inherited OVER dominant genes. So when two blue eyed people have an offspring their child is more likely to get blue eyes than any other color. \n\nAs for why they're common, they are mostly with Caucasian people. The mutation must've happened a long time ago in northern Europe and colder climates, and as that population kept breeding the more blue eyes humans existed to pass on the genes further. \n\nObviously with many races being comfortable with each other nowadays, there is a chance that the blue or green eye population will decrease and maybe even diminish.

{"title":"ELI5: What is Criminal Justice deinstitutionalization and how does it work?","question_detail":"Could someone please explain to me what deinstitutionalization of the criminal justice system is and like what the advantages and drawbacks are? I'm so confused because all information seems to be about deinstitutionalization of psychiatric hospitals and that's not what I am trying to learn about! ","answer":"Once upon a time, we had \"sanitariums\" for people with mental problems and \"prison\" for people who break laws.  This presumed that the two problems were independent.\n\nMore advanced theories of psychology showed that locking people up didn't fix their mental problems, in fact they have a \"mental illness\" that medicine can sometimes treat.  This led to \"deinstitutionalization\" of the people in sanitariums, and those institutions were closed.  People with mental illnesses are treated like people with other diseases, without jailing them.\n\nHowever, this notion that mental problems and breaking the law are independent is, well, wrong.  Many more people with mental illnesses break laws than the corresponding number of people without mental illnesses.\n\nSo, some people who are in prison have mental illnesses.  There is an argument that they should not be in the same sort of facility as people who break the law for rational reasons.  Perhaps they don't need to be in any sort of facility if they can be \"cured\".  This is not, however, supported by the current set of laws that regulate the criminal justice system.

{"title":"ELI5: Why does enabling WiFi on your phone/tablet make your location more accurate?","question_detail":"","answer":" Wi-Fi and/or cellular towers  can improve GPS location in mobile devices.  By improving, I mean it can accelerate acquisition of satellite data so that you can get an accurate location faster if you are in an area that doesn't happen to have clear access to the open sky.  If your modem has built in GPS, it can try to get it's location on its own.  Otherwise, Google and other services drive around neighborhoods and cataloging the MAC address of your router (if it is broadcasting its SSID) and noting what the location is via GPS.  What this means is, any device connected to that router/modem when requesting location can use Wi-Fi location databases (like Google or Skyhook) to get a relatively accurate location depending on how far you are from the access point.

{"title":"ELI5: Can someone explain the recent changes to the DNC in regards to superdelegate votes and how that compares to 2016 rules?","question_detail":"","answer":"If your precinct votes to elect LaFaunda for the democratic primary, one person goes to a convention center to represent that precinct's votes. They're called delegates. In 2016, there were 4,051 of them. \n\nThe Democrats have another category called superdelegates. In 2016, there were 712 of them. These are party bigwigs, usually ones that have raised a lot of money for the DNC. Each of them gets a vote worth as much as a whole precinct, and they don't have to wait until the convention to say who they're going to vote for. In 2016, that had the effect of Hillary being ahead of Bernie Sanders 300 to 1 before a single precinct voted. This has a major psychological effect, especially when the media plays it out as a horse race. Secondly, it feels undemocratic to have all these individuals with the same power as tens of thousands of voters.\n\nThe DNC just voted to keep superdelegates, but as tiebreakers instead of front-line votes. If LaFaunda gets 3,000 regular delegates, the superdelegates will have zero effect on the Democratic nominee.

{"title":"ELI5 - Why do brain cells regenerate so slowly compared to other cells?","question_detail":"","answer":"When a cell is undergoing the process of mitosis (cellular division) it needs to tone down its activity in order to duplicate its DNA and all of the essential stuff that makes the cell a cell.

{"title":"ELI5: How do computers play Chess? Is it a near infinite web of decisions that each have a probability of success associated to them?","question_detail":"","answer":"Virtually all chess computers use a variation of the mini-max algorithm.  It has two main parts, an evaluation function and a search tree.  \n\nThe evaluation function examines the board without considering future moves and gives it a score.  It is mostly about material, with the familiar Q=9; R=5; B,N=3; P=1 scoring, but with often account for other factors, like squares controlled, pawn structure, and king safety.\n\nThe search tree will generate board positions for all possible move, counter moves, and counter counter moves, etc., to a certain depth.  Then it will use the evaluation function to score the positions.  Eliminating all but the best position when it is your move and all but the worst position for you when it is your opponent's move...that's the minimax part.  It can be visualized like [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Minimax.svg/701px-Minimax.svg.png).\n\nEssentially, it is asking the question \"what is the best position I can force, while my opponent is trying to do exactly the same?\"\n\nThere is a **lot** more to modern chess programs than that, but even this algorithm is the core, and even in its simplest form is strong enough to beat most people."},

{"title":"ELI5: How does the cell \"know\" to create energy?","question_detail":"","answer":"For the same reason if you set a tree on fire, it will burn.\n\nWell..sort of.  Let's take a step back for a second:\n\nWhen you take a hydrocarbon, whether it's sugar or a tree branch or what have you and you BURN it, the hydrocarbon is converted into carbon dioxide, water and releases energy (i.e., fires burn hot).\n\nYour body essentially does a very similar thing. Instead of using fire and very high temperatures to get the reaction going, your body uses enzymes to bind to the sugar molecule and facilitate the reaction at body temperature. In reality, this reaction WANTS to happen spontaneously because from a physics/chemistry standpoint, the breakdown of these sugar molecules into carbon dioxide, water and energy is energetically a favorable process. This is why really old paper (newspapers from decades ago, pirate treasure maps) looks yellow and brownish, sort of like its burnt--this is a process that will happen naturally just much more slowly in the absence of enzymes or setting it on fire.\n\nSo a molecule of sugar will enter a cell. It will bind to an enzyme changing the molecule slightly. Then this new molecule will bind to another enzyme changing it a little more...and so on and so forth until it's been broken down into carbon dioxide, water and the energy released is stored in other molecules like ATP.\n\nThe cell doesn't *know* anything. You're just throwing sugar (or protein or fat) into an environment which facilitates its breakdown.\n\nIn reality, cells sometimes want to use energy to MAKE sugar (or fat or protein) instead of breaking it down. In order to do this, you have to change the environment of the cell. What will happen is a hormone or some other signalling molecule will bind to a cell. This will activate a whole bunch of processes in the cell where the enzymes which facilitate sugar breakdown are changed in a way that they no longer are effective at helping sugar breakdown, so the reaction can't go forward. At the same time, they increase the production of, or simulate other enzymes that will help facilitate the reaction in reverse. Since this is less energetically favorable, this also requires that your cells invest energy to make the reaction go backwards."},

{"title":"ELI5: In the election of 1800, how did the tie occur between Jefferson and Burr and how did the 12th Amendment fix that problem?","question_detail":"","answer":"So it used to be that every presidential elector (remember, the U.S. president is not elected by popular vote) got two votes and they got to pick two candidates. Whoever got the majority would be president and whoever got the second most would be vice president. If there was no majority or if there was a tie, the House of Representatives would choose.\n\nThe flaws in this system were exposed pretty quickly. In 1796 John Adams won the majority of electoral votes but his party's delegates couldn't line up behind a second candidate, so his rival Thomas Jefferson became Vice President. Turns out having two people who disagree with each other in the two highest offices of the executive branch wasn't real productive.\n\nIn 1800, the opposite happened. Every Democratic-Republican delegate voted the same way and Jefferson and Aaron Burr both got exactly the same number of votes, and the House had to choose which one of them became president.\n\nThe Twelfth Amendment devised a new system that we still use today, where the president and vice president run on separate ballots, and each elector gets one vote for each. Technically it's still possible for a president and vice president to be of different parties, but in the modern system electors are pledged to vote depending on the votes in their state, and thus are usually prevented from \"splitting the ticket.\""},
{"title":"ELI5: what is different about upload and download speeds that makes ISPs give you fast download but barely any upload speed?","question_detail":"","answer":"Depends on the tech you're using. The real answer is the average consumer uses much more download than upload. For the ISP, it's a cost issue, and largely dependent on tech. For one, upload is generally cheaper for an ISP to provide because their peering agreements typically focus on how uneven their traffic is. If their upload is equal to their download it's generally free to peer. So extra data uploaded actually reduces the price of their download.\n\nNow, where tech matters is how upload is actually different from download. On a regular ethernet connection you typically have one pair of wires for download and one pair for upload, so you just get equal (symmetric) bandwidth because each side has an equal, dedicated, area. With shared tech it's different. Wireless tech might have a shared channel where you can send or receiver, but never both at the same time. I think most out there allow whatever direction you want at any point, but sometimes you want to enforce upload time and download times, so you might apply a policy that reflects actual usage to get the maximum utilization, and that would typically mean giving everyone more download than upload.\n\nWith cable modems the issue is you have channels, 125 usually on cable TV, the modems get so many Mbps per channel, and will select a chunk and bond them together to get a connection. Each channel can only transmit in one direction, and each channel is shared with everyone on your node and TV. So in real life you'll have channels for example, 1-80 for TV, 81-99 for PPV, 100-125 for modems (all made up, each ISP chooses how they deal them out), of that they select 100-105 for upload and 106-125 for download. All the modems on the node use all those channels at once and share the available bandwidth. Doing this gives maximum bandwidth because if it was a 50/50 split you'd be short on download and have loads of unused upload."},

{"title":"ELI5: How does the British education system work compared to US’s? What are secondary schools, grammar schools, all that?","question_detail":"","answer":"Not sure exactly how it compares to the US, but this is how it works in England (note that it's different in the other parts of the UK, especially Scotland).\n\nPrimary school is between the ages of 5 and 11. I guess that's the equivalent of elementary school.\n\nAfter that comes secondary school. That's between the ages of 11 and 16. At the end of that you do GCSEs (General Cerificate of Secondary Education). \n\nStudents typically do around 10 GCSEs, each in a different subject. Maths, english and science are compulsory, but other than that it depends on what subjects your school teaches and what you choose to do.\n\nGrammar schools are a type of secondary school that have entrance exams. They are funded by taxes, but distinct from comprehensive schools which take students of all levels of ability.\n\nThere are also private schools which you have to pay for. Confusingly we have \"public\" schools which are old elite schools which you have to pay for (e.g. Eton).\n\nAfter the age of 16 you have to stay in some kind of education or training until you're 18. The typical academic route is that you do A-levels, but you could also do an apprenticeship.\n\nIf you do A-levels you'd either carry on at your secondary school in the \"6th form\" or go to a separate \"college\". Even though it's called college, it's more like high school.\n\nTypically students do 3 or 4 A-levels. There are no specific requirements for the subjects you do. So students can be really specific and just do science based subjects or just humanities or a mix if you want.\n\nThen you can go to university. Unlike American universities you apply for a specific subject right from the start. You might get some opportunities to take a few classes in other subjects, but for the most part your classes will be based around the subject you applies for.\n\n"},

{"title":"ELI5:Why are camera angles so important in photography?","question_detail":"","answer":" \n\nThe ones you know how to properly use. Otherwise they bring awkwardness and really taxable on the viewer.\n\nCommonly listed, largely cited and highly regarded are establishing, wide, mid and close shots.\n\nEstablishing  gives the idea about the surroundings, setting of the story. Wide gives  the idea about story place in the larger world, character’s place in  the larger world, through the comparisong with surroundings and  interactions with the surroundings (are the character belong to this  world? are he outcast?). Middle engages us in the interactions between  the charactes, enables us to see reactions, gives enough space for  emotions. Close-up concentrates on the reactions of the caracter to  whatever is going on, highly personal and emotional.\n\nRest would be different interpretations of such shots. Keep in mind: tool doesn’t matter - what matters is the purpose.  Angles, shots, camera work - is a tool. Story is a purpose. If some  fancy angle serves your purpose and/or is a requirement - then it will  enrich the movie. Take note of the camera work of the any of last 35  years Best Cinematography Oscar’s winners &amp; contenders. Shots are  done beautifully and all unnecessary cut of on the editing desk."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why aren't more buildings built into cliffs or subterranean holes?","question_detail":"This question comes off a post on r/pics. With today's technology it seems like building into the ground (not just support beams) or into cliff faces would be a great alternative for growing cities. ","answer":"For existing cities, there is a lot of infrastructure under buildings. Sewer, power, and in some cases subways. You can't just dig through those. Plus once a building is already built, to extend down would require digging through the foundation of the building, which would compromise the stability of the building.\n\nAs for why cities weren't built into cliff faces from the beginning, there are a lot of reasons why that would be a bad idea. To start cities are rarely build with a lot of fore thought, usually people build a few homes, later some stores, and eventually it turns into a city. But for someone to start with building there home into a cliff would be a lot of work work. Digging into the cliff side to build a home is much more difficult than cutting trees and building a house. Also living in a cave would get very cold. From a modern viewpoint running power and data lines behind the walls would be nearly impossible if you build a house inside a cliff wall. Lastly people build homes near easily accessible sources of water, rivers and lakes. While there are a number of rivers that run through canyons that have cliffs you could build into, those locations aren't very convenient. Imagine living at the bottom of the Grand Canyon and having to travel all the way up the cliff to leave town, and all the way back down to get home."},

{"title":"ELI5: How does a neural network work and how can you tell it it's purpose?","question_detail":"","answer":"**ELI5**\n\nIt's like voting, except some people get more than 1 vote.\n\n**Voting Example**\n\nImagine 3 people have to vote yes/no.

Let's say Person 2 and 3 voted 'yes', and Person 1 voted 'no'. \n\nThat means 100% of the valid votes went for 'yes', which counts as the final group vote result of 'yes'.\n\n**Updating Voting Power**\n\nNow, let's say that we found out that voting 'yes' was a really horrible idea. As punishment Person 2 and 3 lose voting power and Person 1 gains voting power (since Person 1 was correct last time).

{"title":"ELI5: What were the components of the Housing Crisis?","question_detail":"","answer":"\n- Mortgage backed securities.  It used to be, you'd borrow money from a bank to buy a house, then pay the bank back over many years / decades.  Now banks bundle mortgages and sell the bundles to investors.  Before, it was super important for banks to make sure you could afford it, because the bank would lose money if you didn't pay it back.  With the MBS innovation, the investors are on the hook, so the bank can make more money if they are less careful.\n- Improper risk evaluation of sliced securities.  The MBS were sliced like sausage and the less risky portions were given solid AAA credit ratings, because everybody thought it was impossible for house prices to drop all over the country at the same time.\n- Mark-to-market accounting.  Traditionally something like an MBS would be valued based on projections of its future income.  But because MBS can be bought and sold, some accountants decided banks have to value them based on the market price.  So what happens when there's a panic in the MBS markets, the market price for MBS drops, but the income is fine?  A smart investor will hang on because the price for that income stream is too low.  But because of the mark-to-market rule, the accountants tell them they have to sell because otherwise the accounting value of the bank will be too low.  Selling reduces the prices, which causes more banks to sell more MBS, and the panic feeds on itself and gets bigger and bigger until the entire financial industry crashes.  They eventually got rid of the mark-to-market rule, but the damage had already been done.\n"},
{"title":"ELI5: Why is it so difficult for a plane pilot to do a water landing?","question_detail":"Hello, I just saw the movie Sully and I don't quite understand why it was such an accomplishment, I really want to understand so I can appreciate it. Thanks a lot :)","answer":"Two facts:  \n1) water is much more dense than air, meaning that it takes much more force to push aside than air does--and Newton's Laws mean that the water pushes back just as hard on the plane  \n2) commercial airliners are not built to accommodate this issue  \n\nLanding a plane on land isn't exactly easy, but if you're trained for it, it's not that hard, because it's BUILT to do that. You're not quite level when you hit the ground? No big deal, the landing gear will stop the low side of the plane from getting any lower. And, the landing gear has wheels so it doesn't catch on the ground, and the plane is built to be strong against forces coming through the landing gear.  \n\nLanding an airliner in water? Hoo boy. Anything that dips into the water will *catch*, and the plane is NOT designed to take those forces. Not only can pieces rip off, but any part that catches in the water will pull the plane further away from straight and level, making the problem worse. Landing an airliner in the water requires the pilot to get everything *just right* on the first try, with very little time to make corrections."},

{"title":"ELI5: What does it mean for, at high energies, the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces to combine into one force? How does this force act and why do the three forces combine?","question_detail":"","answer":"You're thinking about it backwards. It's not that three separate forces combine at high energies, it's that there is a single force at high energies which splits into three at low energies. It's a phase transition.\n\nAt a certain energy scale, there is a reduction in symmetry, which causes the one \"unified\" force to split into multiple separate forces.\n\n[This figure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_constant#/media/File:Coupling_constants_as_function_of_energy_(sketch\\).svg) schematically shows what we think we know so far. So we aren't entirely sure that all four forces should be unified at high energies, but it looks like they could be, just based on the behavior of their couplings.\n\nBut just look at the electromagnetic and weak forces. At high energies, you have a single electroweak force. But as you go to lower energies, there is a spontaneously broken symmetry, which splits the electroweak force into two force with separate gauge groups. Specifically, it splits into a U(1) theory with one massless gauge boson (the photon; this is the electromagnetic force), and an SU(2) theory with massive gauge bosons (the W^(+/-) and Z^(0); this is the weak force)."},
{"title":"ELIF: How does a mouse get away with eating a snake","question_detail":"I was recently browsing r/awww and saw a post about a mouse seemingly befriending a snake, but then a later post showed the mouse ate the snake, and apparently this isn’t a first time since another person also dealt with that, How does a mouse even get away with that and why doesn’t the snake just eat it? ","answer":"Snakes don’t “hunger” like we do. They eat rarely and then wait. \n\nA snake, particularly a constrictor, will often have a passive response to injury. Which is to say they’ll move away from it, they might take a strike at it, but they don’t eat things just “because”. \n\nIt’s hard to imagine for us, but snakes don’t feel passive hunger all the time. They can’t just decide “I’ll eat this, since it’ll work out” because they rely on an eating schedule of sorts. Over eating means they’ll vomit it all back up, and then they have to find an entirely new meal. They won’t eat either of the vommitted meals. \n\nSo they’ll prefer to run away or try to bluff, but they actually don’t have a ton of responses outside of biting something. If that doesn’t stop it, they’re probably lot going to win. The mouse, well, a few pin pricks without construction or venom will only scare it. "},

{"title":"ELI5: why do some projected images/videos appear to “decompose” into separate colors when looked past quickly?","question_detail":"","answer":"Those are single chip DLP projectors. The DLP uses a semiconductor chip with micro mirrors over each pixel. A bright light is reflected off the DMD into the lens. To make color, they use a rotating color filter wheel. It projects red, then green, then blue and repeats. More expensive projectors use three DMDs one each for red, green, and blue. They don't suffer from the rainbow effect.  "},

At the same time, other plants seem to shed their foliage completely, wither and hibernate, or die. Why can some plants stay green all year?","answer":"Basically. If plants do photosynthesis. They always lose gas and water. Normal trees would loose too much water therefore they'd die if they would keep doing it in winter. Pines and other stuff have found a way to lose less water. This method allows them to keep photosynthesis up through the whole year. But it is less effective in spring and summer. "},

{"title":"ELI5: Nitric Oxide Carcinogenesis","question_detail":"I've read in several studies that oversaturation of **nitric oxide** can promote cancer and tumor growth. Self-pleasure or having sex causes your body to produce **nitric oxide** to sustain an erection.\n\nSo, that being said, wouldn't you overproduce **nitric oxide** and *cancer-ify* yourself if you regularly edge for long periods of time? Aren't you perpetuating the production of nitric oxide to sustain your vigor?","answer":"One point is scale. The amount of nitric oxide needed to  signal \"widen blood vessels\" is really little, and probably not an oversaturation. Without searching for papers, a lot of cancer research is done in cell culture and the conditions you can create in cell culture can be extremely harsh. Chances are, these conditions would occur only very rarely and very locally in your body.\n\n Another thing is balance and feedback loops. Nitric oxide is quite reactive - which is probably why it can help cancer develop. It just throws a wrench in the mechanisms that constantly tell cells to remain non-cancer cells. And yet, we have several proteins that actively make nitric oxide, so there is also a range of mechanisms to control the amount of nitric oxide, turn it over into something we can easily excrete for example. And for something so reactive there usually are backup mechanisms for the backup mechanisms.\n\nThe third thing is that different cells interpret the same messages in different ways. Muscle cells relax when they sense nitric oxide. Nerve cells interpret nitric oxide differently even depending on what kind of nerve cell they are. And cancerous/pre-cancerous cells read it another way.\nBottom line is, boners are not lethal."},

{"title":"ELI5: The Bible","question_detail":"Never actually read it, only snippets in school.

Let's see...in no particular order, there's Egypt, the Babylonians, the Canaanites, I think the Babylonians again, the Assyrians, the Syrians, the Philistines, and a bunch of others, and then finally Rome.\n\nThen, right at the end (chronologically speaking), this young reformer shows up, challenging the high priests and their establishment, and claiming to be the Son of God.\n\nHis thing was, \"Hey, love God, and don't be a dick to each other.\"  But, since the Priests and their buddies were all about being giant dicks to each other, they turned him over to the Romans, who executed him for claiming to be a King (only Caesar can be King).\n\nWell, he gets better, then goes away.  His friends who bought into him being God go off on a mission converting people and teaching them to love God and not be dicks to each other.  Then they write a bunch of letters to each other.\n\nIt ends with a rant about Nero encrypted in symbolism of the end of time that sounds suspiciously like an asteroid strike and the aftermath, and some kind of massive battle at a place called Megiddo that everyone else always wants to call Armageddon for some reason."},

The text that is searched on YouTube is shown only for about 3 seconds, and is on the bottom of the screen (a struggle to read due to the size of text and video quality) and laid over the top of a banner image that also makes it harder to read the text.","answer":"Not very ELI5, but they probably use a neural network trained in object and text (possibly even audio) recognition to generate tags for the video.\n\n\nSomething like [mountain, sunset, cat, \"There's no place like home\"] so searching for \"cat house\" or \"beautiful sunsets\" could pull up that video with those tags."},
{"title":"ELI5: How does meditation help your mind?","question_detail":"","answer":"It depends on what sort of meditation you practice. Mindfullness (Or Vipassana in the Buddhist tradition) is about noticing how thoughts and feelings arise in consciousness, and about letting them pass freely. \n\nSay for instance you’re mad about someone cutting you off in traffic. It’s in our nature to get angry, and to hold on to that anger, and stew in the misery it creates. If you’re aware of what creates the anger, and are able to observe the feelings as just that, feelings, you’re able to quickly let go of that unpleasantness. \n\nIt can also lead to deeper exploration of the mind, and eventually to the dissolution of the idea of “self”. That is, you are nothing but the consciousness itself, there is no “you” doing the thinking. This concept is debated, and is hard to grasp even with lots of practice."},
{"title":"ELI5: Why does the federal reserve pay interest to banks? What is the impact of this?","question_detail":"I've heard it's because they want to limit banks from lending, which is pretty understandable bc of the 2008 crisis. If anyone can explain more reasons as to why the fed pays interest and implications of it that would be great!","answer":"The overnight cash rate (OCR) is set by The Fed which then *influences* interest rates in the country. Capital adequacy requirements mandate that banks hold a certain amount of cash at any given time, sometimes they have more than they need and sometimes they have less. \n\nIn either case what do the banks do? Banks with excess cash (why would they keep it? they can't pay themselves interest for holding it) lend to those who are short on cash - naturally there are interest payments from those that borrow to those that are lending. This is largely a demand/supply market so the interest rates on these short term loans is determined by how much excess money is available and how much is required.\n\nNow here is where the Fed comes in - Let's say the Fed has set the OCR at 2% - they don't actually go out to all banks and say \"hey guys, set your rates at 2% yeah? we'll all agree right?\" - institutions will invariably cheat. What they actually do is **guarantee** that they will either **lend** or **borrow** money from banks between 1.95% and 2.05%. This mechanism ensures that irrespective of supply and demand the OCR will remain within those two bands. Banks still borrow/lend to each other opportunistically but the **guarantee** of a floor or ceiling ensures that the actual interest rate received by you and i is roughly 2%. \n\nRead about monetary policy and repurchase agreements if you want to know more "},

If I have missed anything that may be useful just shout. ","answer":"Hydrocolloid bandages prevent the wound from reacting with oxygen and forming a scab.

Without a scab the wound can heal a bit faster and I guess allow dirt or debris to work it’s way out of he wound.\n\nI know that they are recommended for road rash injuries and that they can result in less visible scarring.

{"title":"ELI5: Why is antibiotic resistance such a severe, widespread issue and resistance to treatments involving other pathogens (e.g. virus, funghi) isn’t, even if the entirity of the pathogen isn’t killed thus allowing for natural selection?","question_detail":"","answer":"They're all important issues but antibiotic resistance is so much more severe and widespread because antibiotics are prescribed far more often than antivirals or antifungals. \n\nAntifungal resistance isnt as severe of an issue because there are only 4 species of fungi that are capable of causing primary infections. The rest off pathogenic fungi are opportunistic, meaning that they don't cause disease in a healthy host that has a normal immune system. \n\nAntiviral resistance is a bigger issue than antifungal because viral infection is more common than fungal infection. Still the number of pathogenic viruses (208) is considerably less than the number of pathogenic bacteria (538). Also many viral infections can be prevented through vaccinations. Also physicians are less likely to prescribe antivirals due to lack of reliable rapid diagnostic tests, late presentation of patients to care, difficulty distinguishing viral infections clinically from other infections, and a lack of confidence in the effectiveness of antivirals."},

{"title":"ELI5: When EM waves are created, why do electrons create a wave instead of a single pulse of energy?","question_detail":"From how I currently understand it, am EM wave is created when an electron jumps to a lower orbital shell and releases some energy. So why does it create a wave with multiple pulses of energy? Can an electron only give off a certain amount of energy at once so it has to bounce back and forth between orbital shells until it's stable again?","answer":"My take on it-\n\nSpin is a sort of \"inherent\" angular momentum present in a particle. We cannot observe it, but we can deduce it.\n\nIf you look at what shape waves have, they tend to be sinusoidal in nature. A sinusoidal wave is the result of tracing out one dimension of a point on a circle as it rotates. \n\nIf you imagine an electron, rotating in a full 4 dimensional spacetime, emitting a point of energy that intersects our 3 dimensions, we would get a wave, similar to the sine wave from a circle. \n\nTo the latter part of your question, the amount of energy that an electron can give or receive will be a boundary condition. Imagine a circle of some radius. If you want to increase the radius by one unit, it's area would increase proportional to radius squared. Similar for a sphere- increasing the radius by one unit increases the volume proportional to radius cubed. \n\nThe amount of energy needed to raise the energy level is going to be proportional to the analog of volume, and the analog of radius. The exact amount of energy needed to increase \"radius\" by one unit. (or decrease by one unit). "},

{"title":"ELI5 - what does ‘misfiring’ mean in respect to an automotive error? what is happening when a car “misfires”??","question_detail":"","answer":" \n\nIf your petrol engine misfires it can fall into four, main areas. Fuelling, ignition, mechanical or ECU .\n\nFuelling can effect just one cylinder quite easily today because we have multi point fuel injection. A defective injector or wiring issue to the injector can be the cause. Fuelling in the past relied on a carburettor, sometimes more than one. There are several ways a worn, blocked or badly set up carburettor can cause running problems however most issues will cause general problems rather than problems for one cylinder.\n\nWith ignition, it can be a defective coil pack defective HT lead or plug. With older systems with distributors you could have any number of issues from incorrect timing, damaged cap, wrong point gap or burnt points, defective condenser, broken or damaged advance springs worn distributor cams or worn distributor bearings. They really were a source of perpetual grief.\n\nWith mechanical issues it can be damaged valves and seats broken rings, damaged bores or potentially head gasket issues.\n\nWith an ECU problem all bets are off, unless it is a connector plug problem all manner of weird stuff can happen and it can be so expensive to fix that it can make things uneconomic. Not all cars can just have their ECU swapped. Generally though if the engine warning light comes on at the same time as your misfire it will be identifying a sensor failure like a crank position sensor or perhaps MAF or temp sensor problem. This is likely to cause general running problems not just a misfire.\n\nMost cars are fitted with a port that you can plug an OBD Canbus reader into. They are really cheap now. This will identify a defective injector, ignition or main sensor problem. It will probably tell you the cylinder that is defective too.\n\nIt is generally easy to replace a spark plug or swap a lead. One car I own eats coil packs, perhaps every year, so much so, I keep one in the boot for when it fails. I replace the plugs at service intervals. The HT leads are original and have done 200,000 miles so far.\n\nThe best way to check for mechanical issues is to use a compression tester. You should get similar numbers for each cylinder. If you don't you can add a small amount of oil to identify if it is a bore or valve thing. If you suspect it is a cylinder head gasket problem, you can get a garage to do a test on your coolant for combustion problems or you might have a creamy deposit on the inside of your filler cap. Generally bore or valve guide issues are accompanied by high oil use, sooty exhausts and high back pressure too.\n\nInjector problems are often a problem with the wiring. Injectors can and often do go on for over 200,000 miles, so the service life of the engine. If you are unlucky enough to have a damaged injector, they can be fiercely expensive. Carburettors can have a wealth of potential problems. Cars with multiple carburettors more so.\n\nThere are no doubt other potential problems like old fuel, incorrect fuel, contaminated fuel or low tension wiring issues but the main sources are covered above."},

{"title":"ELI5: Why do trees devour things?","question_detail":"What's happening when a tree \"eats\" a fence or bench, or others trees for that matter?","answer":"Trees simply grow around obstacles - they can't relocate (they're trees after all), so their only choices are to push things away that interfere with growth or encapsulate things in their path as they grow.  Plant tissue literally engulfs objects and in most cases binds strongly to such objects.\n\nA real kicker is when trees actually devour things that are found in the soil.  In large swaths of the upper northwest, trees located near bear fishing habitats are filled with microscopic bits of salmon as a result of roots \"feeding\" on salmon carcasses discarded by bears.  It's actually a fungal network that feeds the trees, but you get the idea.  More on that here - [Trees Eating Salmon](https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/from-tree-to-shining-tree).

{"title":"ELI5: Why is HD referred to as 1080P, which is it's vertical resolution (1920x1080), while UHD is referred to as 4K, which is its horizontal resolution (3840 x 2160)?","question_detail":"I would've assumed the naming convention was standard but just now realized they name them opposite from one another. Why not call the latter 2K? Yeah, you'd be rounding but you're rounding to 4K as is anyways. Does this even have a legitimate reason behind it?","answer":"“4K” is the term used in digital projectors in theaters; their predecessors/lower resolution counterparts were indeed called “2K.”\n\nHD being called 1080p comes from the world of video, where the vertical resolution is more important...firstly, because old-fashioned analog video/CRT video generated their images in rows of horizontal lines, and secondly, there’s a distinction between whether those lines were generated as two interlaced fields, or one progressive picture: the “i” in 1080i (which is still common in broadcast video), and “p” in 1080p.\n\nAs the others have pointed out, the true term for the newer higher resolution TVs is UHD, but since the resolution is (shy of but) similar enough to digital theater’s 4K, 4K has become an interchangeable term for it."},

{"title":"ELI5. How the eff do computers work?","question_detail":"","answer":"Computers are made out of little tiny switches called transistors. You put a voltage over a transistor, then it will make voltage on a different wire.  \n\n\nYou can combine the transistors to make really circuits called logic gates, which have rules like, if wire 1 has voltage, and wire 2 has voltage then put a voltage on wire 3. There are a few very basic gates such as and, or, nand (for not and) nor, xor (the output wire has voltage if one input wire has voltage and the other doesn't) and xnor.  \n\n\nUsing gates, you make tiny circuits that do things like add 2 numbers in binary (an adder) switch on if you get voltage on this line, and off if you get voltage on this line (a reset set latch), shift a few voltages down from wire to wire (a shift register) and turn on and off other circuits.  \n\n\nThen you combine these little circuits into bigger ones that can control other circuits, and connect different circuits to each other to move information around. Information can also be saved in small circuits we call registers as a binary number. They may seem strange, but binary numbers are no different from decimal numbers. For example 11 in binary is the same as 3 in decimal, 101 is 5, 10 is 2, and 100 is 4. You can also learn to count in binary, and with a good teacher most people can learn to count in binary in less than an hour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith these larger circuits, you can make very complicated circuits that can process instructions, save and remember information, and connect to circuits on other computer parts like a monitor, or keyboard, or graphics card, or ram.  \n\n\nTo say these things are very complicated is an understatement. In the very early days of computers they drew these circuits by hand, but computer have long sense passed the ability of any one human to understand it. Instead, we draw circuits on the computers, and we turn very complicated circuits into boxes with names, and just connect the input and output lines together. The computer program then figures out what that circuit looks like, and where to put all the transistors, and how to connect all the wires for us.  \n\n\nSorry if this explanation is too complicated. Building computer systems is exceptionally hard, and usually we have to work in massive teams of engineers, who each tackle little tiny parts of the computer system, or figure out how to build larger parts out of smaller ones. Also, programming computers is just as challenging, but we constantly built new programming languages that are suited for different types of programs."},

Think about if the top was open, the level of the water in that rectangular tube would be determined by the balance of pressure on its surface compared to the pressure on the surface elsewhere. Since it is atmospheric pressure in both cases it would be equal level.\n\nHowever suppose you lowered the air pressure above the tube, such as you would when sucking on a straw? The water would be pushed upwards by the greater pressure elsewhere.\n\nThe capped tube/box is similar to that straw in that water can't fall out of the bottom without leaving a void in the top of the box, a void which pressure from the atmosphere would tend to force water into. The box could be as high as atmospheric pressure can push the water (about 32 feet at sea level)."},

{"title":"ELI5: how does a catheter work?","question_detail":"My mother has a super-pubic catheter (she has MS and is bed-bound after a stroke). In fact, I just helped change her catheter so I know a tube goes in... but why/how does one end make a balloon and how does that force urine out?  I’m not a nurse so any medical stuff I’ve done has been taught to me by dad or watching nurses.  It also forms crystals in the tube that blocks things up... is that normal? ","answer":"I'm not a doctor, but iirc you have two sphincter that work to release the urine from your bladder. One involuntary, and a voluntary one. The involuntary one tells your body you need to pee. The voluntary one allows you to not pee all over yourself when this occurs. \nThe catheter holds both sphincters open so the urine can be released immediately. Presumably by the tube itself, and the balloon holds the catheter inside the bladder so it doesn't fall out.\nNot sure what the crystals are though."},

{"title":"ELI5: How to extension chords and power towers work? Do they split the power or is more power drawn from the socket?","question_detail":"","answer":"So to get a little more technical (but hopefully not enough to confuse), all electricity is, is the flow of electrons. If I have a positively and negatively charged electrode and I put a piece of wire between them it will allow the flow of electrons. Remember a positively charged atom wants to gain an electron really badly while a negatively charged atom wants to lose one just as bad, and they will move heaven and earth to lose or gain those electrons.\n\nNow say I want to make use of this electron flow and make some artificial light for myself. I take some wire (filament) and glass and with some industrial magic I make myself a light bulb. When I attach this light bulb to my positive and negative terminals electrons begin to flow through the filament. Now because this wire has been selected to have a high resistance, it produces heat which is sufficient to produce actual light.\n\nSo in terms of your extension cords and power boards, this are just a means of extending the distance from the source of supply and distributing it efficiently. I plug my extension lead into the wall, run it out 30 meters, plug a power board into it and plug my light into the socket. The electrons flow down one copper wire in your extension cord and power board then when the light is plugged in I create a return path through the filament and then through the other copper wire in the extension cord completing the circuit and allowing the electrons to flow freely.\n\nSo now let’s talk about the devices you want to plug into your power board. Every electrical device draws current (measured in amps); your TV, microwave, your phone charger, anything that can be plugged into a source of electricity will draw current. The more current you draw the more heat is generated so in order to stop the wires and the electrical devices bursting into flames we introduce circuit protection such as circuit breakers and fuses to ‘trip’ the circuit in the case of overload.\n\nThere is a mathematical formula called 'ohm's law' that can be used to work out the amount of current being drawn by what is plugged into any particular circuit. I'll be using 240v for the example.\n\nLet start with defining the terms\nP = Power in Watts.\nI = Current in Amperes\nV = Voltage in Volts\n\nWe can arrange these in a neat little triangle to look somewhat like this:\n                                             P\n                                          I    V\n\nWe can now use this formula to work out the amount of Amps an appliance draws. \n\nLet's take a 2000 watts heater running at full revs. We already know the values of P (watts) and V (volts), which for the purposes of this example we can accept as fixed values (these 2 parameters can vary based on other factors but that's beyond the scope of this discussion), so using these 2 already known values we can calculate the amount of current in amps that heater is pulling.\n\nI (?) = P (2000) / V (240)\n\nI = 2000 / 240\n\nI = 8.3amps\n\nSo now that we understand how to work out how much current an appliance draws we can talk about circuit protection. Most circuit breakers work with a dual thermal and magnetic protection. We can ignore the magnetic protection and just focus on the thermal.\n\nAs current in a circuit increases so does heat. If I have a 20A circuit and I plug my single 2000w heater into i'm going to be fine because i'm only drawing 8.3A on a 20A circuit, but let's say I decide to plug in 3 of my 2000w heaters. \n\nAll of a sudden i'm drawing 24A on a 20A circuit. The heat generated by the overload in current activates the thermal protection of the circuit breaker causing the circuit to trip.\n\nSo this went well beyond the scope of your question, but I think it might help you understand what causes a fuse/circuit breaker to go in an overload situation, which happens quite commonly for people who use power boards without consideration for the current that the combined appliances are pulling."},
{"title":"ELI5: The difference between Catholics, Orthodox, Protestants, and Christians.","question_detail":"","answer":"Christianity came first. There was just one Christian church. The Western European Christians said that the official seat of the Church was in Rome. They said that Christians in Eastern Europe should submit to the West's authority and pay them money. The Eastern European Christians refused. \n\nSo they split the church. The Western European Church is called the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern European Church is called the Eastern Orthodox Church.\n\nNow Western Europe is Roman Catholic. Then the Southwestern Europeans Christians wanted the Northwestern European Christians to submit to their authority and pay them money. The Northwestern European Christians didn't want to. So they \"protested\" the Catholic Church and became protestants.\n\nThen all of those groups had similar fights over authority and money and split into even smaller groups. So broadly speaking, Eastern Europe is a variant of Eastern Orthodox. Southwestern Europe including Italy, France, Spain, etc. are Roman Catholic. And Northwestern Europe including England, Germany, Finland, etc. are Protestant.\n\nThere are minor variations in church doctrine. For example, Catholics believe that when the priest blesses communion crackers and wine, they *literally* turn into the body and blood of Jesus Christ. Protestants think it just figuratively represents the body and blood of Christ. But besides that, it's largely a political and economic split. For example, Catholics believe you need a priest (who you pay) to talk to God for you. Protestants believe you can talk to God directly (without giving money to Rome)."},
{"title":"ELI5: where does my water go after it goes down the drain?

At the sewer plant, a combination of mechanical filtration through metal screens, oil traps and gravel/sand filters. Biological processing of the waste where bacteria and sometimes aquatic plants will convert the nutrients in sewage into safer products and finally chemical processing to neutralize any chemicals people have dumped into the sewers, or any bad bacteria and viruses that might be in the water. Then often the water is sent down stream into a river or ocean."},
{"title":"ELI5: How do reed diffusers work?","question_detail":"Bonus question: why do you sometimes suddenly smell the fragrance after being in the room for hours","answer":"There's three important things at play here. First of all, oil likes to stick together. Put a couple of drips on a table and it won't just spread out everywhere - it will stay together a little. Whatever the situation, it will kinda try to stay joined up. Secondly, oil likes to stick to stuff a lot. Put some on the walls of a glass and the oil will take ages to leave the walls and reach the bottom. Third of all, oil likes to evaporate. A small amount of the oil molecules will turn into a gas when you just put them close to the air.\n\nWhen you put the reeds into the oil, the molecules are attracted to each other and to the reeds. A little bit goes higher, which pulls more molecules up, and the oil just keeps creeping up the reeds. Because the rods are long and thin, a lot of the oil is close to the air - so some oil molecules turn into gas and float into your nose."},
