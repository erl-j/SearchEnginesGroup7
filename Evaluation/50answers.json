"},{"index":6494,"answer_text":"UV radiation from the Sun, or artificially from UV lights such as tanning beds, can damage your skin.  Thankfully this type of radiation doesn't penetrate very far b/c its not that strong, so the only risk is to your skin and UV can be blocked easily with a layer like a t-shirt or sunscreen.  Which is also why we have greater incidence rates of skin cancer today than 50yrs ago, b/c the ozone layer of the atmosphere has been damaged by pollution.  Ozone filters out some of the UV, so less Ozone means more UV making it to people sitting on the beach.\n\nThe way UV damages your skin cells is by a single photon (can think of it as the smallest piece of light) to collide with an atom (single particle of matter) in your DNA.  Since DNA is basically the instructions on how to build and operate a cell, having an error in the code can have all sorts of consequences.  But remember that your DNA is millions of characters long, and the UV photon is damaging just one of them.  So the vast majority of errors have no effect, either b/c the cell fixes the error, b/c the error doesn't manifest itself in a meaningful way (a lot of DNA has no purpose or has limited importance) or b/c results in just that one cell dying (irrelevant to your health).  Its like changing one letter in an extensive book of instructions, odds are that you can tell the error b/c it makes no sense, but occasionally it could lead to catastrophic error.   Bad example, but if looking at instructions for escalator and had changed from \"stop immediately\" to \"step immediately\", you can see the problem with one random character change in the right place (whereas changing any other character would likely have no impact).\n\nSo what is cancer?  If the photon creates an error in the right place, it can cause a cell to go haywire and replicate itself in an uncontrolled manner.  This leads to a tumor (mass of cells growing uncontrollably) and eventually spreads and destroys the body.  This happens because cells shed from the tumor and get circulated to other places in the body, which then create new tumors elsewhere.\n\nSo how do so many people get cancer if its so unlikely for a photon to hit in just the right place in your DNA?  The answer is the law of large numbers, the average day on a beach would have trillions upon trillions of UV photons bombarding down on trillions of skin cells -- just a probability function for the right collision to happen, and whamo. So the risk for cancer goes up with exposure in relatively linear way.  This means that you can go your entire life in the Sun and not have get skin cancer, or you can spend one minute in the Sun and get skin cancer -- all depends on your luck, but the probability tells us that more time unprotected in the sun means more likely to get skin cancer.  \n\n"},{"index":4865,"answer_text":"See /r/humanism \n\n&gt; Humanism is a democratic and ethical life stance, which affirms that human beings have the right and responsibility to give meaning and shape to their own lives.

Thermal neutrons are slow-moving neutrons that are produced by chain reactions, and they have a higher chance of  hitting an atom after being produced.  They have less energy than fast neutrons, and so the atom has to be more unstable in order to fission.\n\nThe atoms have to produce at least two neutrons after fission, so that they can sustain a chain reaction.  It must be two or more, as some neutrons do not hit atoms, or do not cause fission, which means a reaction that only produces one neutron will quickly die out.\n\nThe third point means the atoms are unstable, and will likely split upon capturing a neutron.  More stable atoms are less likely to split, and are therefore more likely to cause a chain reaction to \"fizzle out\".\n\nThe last point, a long half-life, makes them relatively safe to handle (Uranium-238 can even be safely held with gloves, as the radiation is mostly alpha particles which cannot penetrate skin.

And almost all Protestants still believe that the Church (which they define as the group of all believers, not just the Catholic Church and indeed often excluding many Catholics who are Christian in name only) is the kingdom of God on Earth, they just don't believe anybody currently alive in the Church can make the authoritative claim to be speaking for God (except when taken directly from the Bible).\n\nCaveat: I am a Protestant.

That means, it cannot predict how a particle will act, it only predicts the probabilities of acting in a certain way. To learn more about determinism vs. probabilism, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmX1W5umC1c).\n\nWhen QM was first proposed, many people - most notably Einstein - thought it was absurd to think that the universe was not inherently deterministic. Hence Einstein's famous exclamation:\"God does not play dice\".\n\nThus, the opponents of this probabilsim came up with several solutions. One of them was, that Quantum Mechanics was deterministic, but we simply couldn't see the variables governing the outcome.

That means, faster than light communication is not possible. \n\n* \"Hidden\", because we couldn't see those variables, but they are still there. Even if we can't see them.

To learn more of this experiment, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuvK-od647c).\n\nThe result of this experiment was, that the local hidden variable theory was wrong.

Then everyone will show up behind the gym after school to make fun of Alice and Bob. \n\nBut since she only sees Bob in class, when Charlie is around, she can't just say \"Hey Bob, let's use a code like substituting Z for A, Y for B, X for C... (and etc)\" because if Charlie hears them say that, then he will know how to decode their love letters. That's because it's a symmetric cipher- If you know how to turn it into code, you also know how to turn it back into plain text.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo Alice comes up with a plan. She chooses two prime numbers (really big ones, like 25+ digits). She realizes that, She can multiply them together (we'll call it \"green\"), form a 3rd and 4th number \"blue\", and \"orange\", which are basically made from each of the primes. \n\n**Blue is basically a public key, which lets anyone encode a message but not decode it. Alice shares this with Bob and doesn't care of Charlie or even the rest of the class knows this.**\n\n**Orange is basically a private key, which lets Alice decode anything encoded with the public key. She keeps this to herself.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe tells Bob, \n\n1) \"Take the first letter of your message, and turn it into a number... (a=65, b=66, c=67 etc)\n\n2) Raise it by **Blue**, and find what the remainder is when you divide it by Green. \n\n3) Then write that down. And then do it for the next number. etc\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**This works because of the special property of a selected pair of prime numbers. What is done with one can only be undone with the other, basically.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCharlie sees these numbers, but has doesn't know what the original letter was before it was divided and turned into a remainder (for example, dividing 12 by 5 has remainder of 2... but so will 17, and 22, and 27 etc). He also knows \"Green\" is a combination of two primes, but they are soooo many combinations it could be. He looks at his multiplication table, seeing it can be any two combination of prime numbers from 2,3,5,7... to  934,361,079,326,356,530,741,942,970,523,610,389  (yes that's prime). He begins  trying different combinations anyway to try and guess which are used...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce Alice gets Bob's encoded letter, she does the following:\n\n4) Raise it by **Orange**, then finds the remainder when it is divided by Green.\n\n5) That gives her the original number of the first letter of Bob's message. (65=a, 66=b, 67=c, etc)\n\n6) She writes it down and repeats for each encoded letter.\n\nAfter doing this, she has reconstructed the love letter, and she now knows to meet Bob behind the gym to kiss.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCharlie eventually breaks the code by trying random prime numbers until he guesses the right ones by luck. However, there were so many combinations to try that, by this point, it's a week after Alice and Bob's meeting behind the gym. It's too late to make fun of them for kissing, so Charlie instead calls Alice a Stupid-Face, while secretly continuing to harbor a crush.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe end.\n\n\\------------------------\n\nFor real math, look up the math behind RSA.
